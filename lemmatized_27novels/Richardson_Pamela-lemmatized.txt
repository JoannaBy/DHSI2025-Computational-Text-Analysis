Pamela ; or , I and , I have great trouble , and some comfort , to acquaint you with . the trouble be , that my good lady die of the illness I mention to you , and leave we all much grieved for the loss of she ; for she be a dear good lady , and kind to all we she servants . much I fear , that as I be take by she ladyship to wait upon she person , I should be quite destitute again , and force to return to you and my poor mother , who have enough to do to maintain yourselves ; and , as my lady 's goodness have put I to write and cast account , and make I a little expert at my needle , and otherwise qualified above my degree , it be not every family that could have find a place that you poor be fit for : but , whose graciousness to we we have so often experience at a pinch , put it into my good lady 's heart , on she death - bed , just a hour before she expire , to recommend to my young master all she servants , one by one ; and when it come to my turn to be recommend , ( for I be sobb and cry at she pillow ) she could only say , my dear son !-- and so break off a little ; and then recover -- remember my poor Pamela -- and these be some of she last word ! of how my eye run -- do not wonder to see the paper so blot . well , but 's will must be do !-- and so come the comfort , that I shall not be oblige to return back to be a clog upon my dear parent ! for my master say , I will take care of you all , my good maiden ; and for you , , ( and take I by the hand ; yes , he take my hand before they all , ) for my dear mother 's sake , I will be a friend to you , and you shall take care of my linen . bless he ! and pray with I , my dear father and mother , for a blessing upon he , for he have give mourning and a year 's wage to all my lady 's servants ; and I have no wage as yet , my lady have say she should do for I as I deserv , order the housekeeper to give I mourn with the rest ; and give I with he own hand four golden guinea , and some silver , which be in my old lady 's pocket when she die ; and say , if I be a good girl , and faithful and diligent , he would be a friend to I , for he mother 's sake . and so I send you these four guinea for you comfort ; for Providence will not let I want : and so you may pay some old debt with part , and keep the other part to comfort you both . if I get more , I be sure it be my duty , and it shall be my care , to love and cherish you both ; for you have love and cherish I , when I could do nothing for myself . I send they by , we footman , who go you way : but he do not know what he carry ; because I seal they up in one of the little pill - box , which my lady have , wrapt close in paper , that they may not chink ; and be sure do not open it before he . I know , dear father and mother , I must give you both grief and pleasure ; and so I will only say , pray for you Pamela ; who will ever be you most dutiful daughter . I have be scare out of my sense ; for just now , as I be fold up this letter in my late lady 's dressing - room , in come my young master ! good sir ! how be I frightene ! I go to hide the letter in my bosom ; and he , see I tremble , say , smile , to whom have you be write , ?-- I say , in my confusion , pray you honou forgive I !-- only to my father and mother . he say , well then , let I see how you be come on in you writing ! of how asham I be !-- he take it , without say more , and read it quite through , and then give it I again ; -- and I say , pray you honou forgive I ! -- yet I know not for what : for he be always dutiful to he parent ; and why should he be angry that I be so to mine ? and indeed he be not angry ; for he take I by the hand , and say , you be a good girl , , to be kind to you aged father and mother . I be not angry with you for writing such innocent matter as these : though you ought to be wary what tale you send out of a family .-- be faithful and diligent ; and do as you should do , and I like you the better for this . and then he say , why , , you write a very pretty hand , and spell tolerably too . I see my good mother 's care in you learning have not be throw away upon you . she use to say you love reading ;
; you may look into any of she book , to improve yourself , so you take care of they . to be sure I do nothing but courtesy and cry , and be all in confusion , at he goodness . indeed he be the best of gentleman , I think ! but I be make another long letter : so will only add to it , that I shall ever be you dutiful daughter , . letter ii [ in answer to the preceding . ] , you letter be indeed a great trouble , and some comfort , to I and you poor mother . we be troublead , to be sure , for you good lady 's death , who take such care of you , and give you learn , and , for three or four year past , have always be give you clothes and linen , and every thing that a gentlewoman need not be asham to appear in . but we chief trouble be , and indeed a very great one , for fear you should be bring to anything dishonest or wick , by be set so above yourself . every body talk how you have come on , and what a genteel girl you be ; and some say you be very pretty ; and , indeed , six month since , when I see you last , I should have think so myself , if you be not we child . but what avail all this , if you be to be ruin and undone !-- indeed , my dear , we begin to be in great fear for you ; for what signify all the riche in the world , with a bad conscience , and to be dishonest ! we be , ' tis true , very poor , and find it hard enough to live ; though once , as you know , it be better with we . but we would sooner live upon the water , and , if possible , the clay of the ditch I contentedly dig , than live better at the price of we child 's ruin . I hope the good ' squire have no design : but when he have give you so much money , and speak so kindly to you , and praise you come on ; and , oh , that fatal word ! that he would be kind to you , if you would do as you should do , almost kill we with fear . I have speak to good old widow about it , who , you know , have formerly live in good family ; and she put we in some comfort ; for she say it be not unusual , when a lady die , to give what she have about she person to she waiting - maid , and to such as sit up with she in she illness . but , then , why should he smile so kindly upon you ? why should he take such a poor girl as you by the hand , as you letter say he have do twice ? why should he stoop to read you letter to we ; and commend you writing and spell ? and why should he give you leave to read he mother 's book ?--Indeed , indeed , my dearest child , we heart aco for you ; and then you seem so full of joy at he goodness , so take with he kind expression , ( which , truly , be very great favour , if he mean well ) that we fear -- yes , my dear child , we fear -- you should be too grateful , -- and reward he with that jewel , you virtue , which no riche , nor favour , nor any thing in this life , can make up to you . I , too , have write a long letter , but will say one thing more ; and that be , that , in the midst of we poverty and misfortune , we have trust in 's goodness , and be honest , and doubt not to be happy hereafter , if we continue to be good , though we lot be hard here ; but the loss of we dear child 's virtue would be a grief that we could not bear , and would bring we grey hair to the grave at once . if , then , you love we , if you wish for 's bless , and you own future happiness , we both charge you to stand upon you guard : and , if you find the least attempt make upon you virtue , be sure you leave every thing behind you , and come away to we ; for we have rather see you all cover with rag , and even follow you to the churchyard , than have it say , a child of ours prefer any worldly convenience to she virtue . we accept kindly you dutiful present ; but , till we be out of pain , can not make use of it , for fear we should partake of the price of we poor daughter 's shame : so have lay it up in a rag among the thatch , over the window , for a while , lest we should be rob . with we blessing , and we hearty prayer for you , we remain , you careful , but love and , and . letter Iii , I must need say , you letter have fill I with trouble , for it have make my heart , which be overflow with gratitude for my master 's goodness , suspicious and fearful : and yet I hope I shall never find he to act unworthy of he character ; for what could
could he get by ruin such a poor young creature as I ? but that which give I most trouble be , that you seem to mistrust the honesty of you child . no , my dear father and mother , be assure , that , by 's , I never will do any thing that shall bring you grey hair with sorrow to the grave . I will die a thousand death , rather than be dishonest any way . of that be assure , and set you heart at rest ; for although I have live above myself for some time past , yet I can be content with rag and poverty , and bread and water , and will embrace they , rather than forfeit my good name , let who will be the tempter . and of this pray rest satisfied , and think better of you dutiful Daughter till death . my master continue to be very affable to I . as yet I see no cause to fear any thing . , the housekeeper , too , be very civil to I , and I have the love of every body . sure they can not all have design against I , because they be civil ! I hope I shall always behave so as to be respect by every one ; and that nobody would do I more hurt than I be sure I would do they . we so often go you way , that I will always get he to call , that you may hear from I , either by writing , ( for it bring my hand in , ) or by word of mouth . , for the last be to my father , in answer to he letter ; and so I will now write to you ; though I have nothing to say , but what will make I look more like a vain hussy , than any thing else : however , I hope I sha not be so proud as to forget myself . yet there be a secret pleasure one have to hear one 's self praise . you must know , then , that my , who , I need not tell you , be my master 's sister , have be a month at we house , and have take great notice of I , and give I good advice to keep myself to myself . she tell I I be a pretty wench , and that every body give I a very good character , and love I ; and bid I take care to keep the fellow at a distance ; and say , that I might do , and be more valued for it , even by themselves . but what please I much be , what I be go to tell you ; for at table , as say , my master and she ladyship talk of I , she tell he she think I the prettiest wench she ever see in she life ; and that I be too pretty to live in a bachelor 's house ; since no lady he might marry would care to continue I with she . he say , I be vastly improve , and have a good share of prudence , and sense above my year ; and that it would be pity , that what be my merit should be my misfortune .-- no , say my good lady , shall come and live with I , I think . he say , with all he heart ; he should be glad to have I so well provide for . well , say she , I will consult my lord about it . she ask how old I be ; and say , I be fifteen last . o ! say she , if the wench ( for so she call all we maiden servants ) take care of herself , she will improve yet more and more , as well in she person as mind . now , my dear father and mother , though this may look too vain to be repeat by I ; yet be you not rejoice , as well as I , to see my master so willing to part with I ?-- this shew that he have nothing bad in he heart . but be just go away ; and so I have only to say , that I be , and will always be , you honest as well as dutiful daughter . pray make use of the money . you may now do it safely . my and , be to go you way , I be willing to write , because he be so willing to carry any thing for I . he say it do he good at he heart to see you both , and to hear you talk . he say you be both so sensible , and so honest , that he always learn something from you to the purpose . it be a thousand pity , he say , that such worthy heart should not have better luck in the world ! and wonder , that you , my father , who be so well able to teach , and write so good a hand , succeed no better in the school you attempt to set up ; but be force to go to such hard labour . but this be more pride to I , that I be come of such honest parent , than if I have be bear a lady . I hear nothing yet of go to ; and I be very easy at present here : for use I as if I be she own daughter , and be a very good woman , and make my master 's interest she own . she be always give I good
good counsel , and I love she next to you two , I think , best of any body . she keep so good rule and order , she be mightily respect by we all ; and take delight to hear I read to she ; and all she love to hear read , be good book , which we read whenever we be alone ; so that I think I be at home with you . she hear one of we man , , who be no better than he should be , speak freely to I ; I think he call I he pretty , and take hold of I , as if he would have kiss I ; for which , you may be sure , I be very angry : and she take he to task , and be as angry at he as could be ; and tell I she be very well pleased to see my prudence and modesty , and that I keep all the fellow at a distance . and indeed I be sure I be not proud , and carry it civilly to every body ; but yet , methinks , I can not bear to be look upon by these men-servant , for they seem as if they would look one through ; and , as I generally breakfast , dine , and sup , with , ( so good she be to I , ) I be very easy that I have so little to say to they . not but they be civil to I in the main , for 's sake , who they see love I ; and they stand in awe of she , knowe she to be a gentlewoman bear , though she have have misfortune . I be go on again with a long letter ; for I love writing , and shall tire you . but , when I begin , I only intend to say , that I be quite fearless of any danger now : and , indeed , can not but wonder at myself , ( though you caution to I be you watchful love , ) that I should be so foolish as to be so uneasy as I have be : for I be sure my master would not demean himself , so as to think upon such a poor girl as I , for my harm . for such a thing would ruin he credit , as well as mine , you know : who , to be sure , may expect one of the best lady in the land . so no more at present , but that I be you ever dutiful daughter . and , my master have be very kind since my last ; for he have give I a suit of my late lady 's clothes , and half a dozen of she shift , and six fine handkerchief , and three of she cambric apron , and four holland one . the clothes be fine silk , and too rich and too good for I , to be sure . I wish it be no affront to he to make money of they , and send it to you : it would do I more good . you will be full of fear , I warrant now , of some design upon I , till I tell you , that he be with when he give they I ; and he give she a mort of good thing , at the same time , and bid she wear they in remembrance of she good friend , my lady , he mother . and when he give I these fine thing , he say , these , , be for you ; have they make fit for you , when you mourning be laid by , and wear they for you good mistress 's sake . give you a very good word ; and I would have you continue to behave as prudently as you have do hithertoo , and every body will be you friend . I be so surprised at he goodness , that I could not tell what to say . I courtesy to he , and to for she good word ; and say , I wish I might be deserve of he favour , and she kindness : and nothing should be want in I , to the best of my knowledge . of how amiable a thing be do good !--It be all I envy great folk for . I always think my young master a fine gentleman , as every body say he be : but he give these good thing to we both with such a graciousness , as I think he look like a angel . say , he ask she , if I keep the man at a distance ? for , he say , I be very pretty ; and to be draw in to have any of they , might be my ruin , and make I poor and miserable betime . she never be want to give I a good word , and take occasion to lanch out in my praise , she say . but I hope she have say no more than I shall try to deserve , though I may not at present . I be sure I will always love she , next to you and my dear mother . so I rest you ever dutiful Daughter . , since my last , my master give I more fine thing . he call I up to my late lady 's closet , and , pull out she drawer , he give I two suits of fine Flander lace headclothes , three pair of fine silk shoe , two hardly the worse , and just fit for I , ( for my lady have a very
very little foot , ) and the other with wrotch silver buckle in they ; and several riband and top - knot of all colour ; four pair of white fine cotton stocking , and three pair of fine silk one ; and two pair of rich stay . I be quite astonished , and unable to speak for a while ; but yet I be inwardly asham to take the stocking ; for be not there : if she have , it would have be nothing . I believe I receive they very awkwardly ; for he smile at my awkwardness , and say , do not blush , : Dost think I do not know pretty maid should wear shoe and stocking ? I be so confound at these word , you might have beat I down with a feather . for you must think , there be no answer to be make to this : so , like a fool , I be ready to cry ; and go away courtesy and blush , I be sure , up to the ear ; for , though there be no harm in what he say , yet I do not know how to take it . but I go and tell all to , who say , put it into he heart to be good to I ; and I must double my diligence . it look to she , she say , as if he would fit I in dress for a waiting -maid 's place on 's own person . but still you kind fatherly caution come into my head , and make all these gift nothing near to I what they would have be . but yet , I hope , there be no reason ; for what good could it do to he to harm such a simple maiden as I ? besides , to be sure no lady would look upon he , if he should so disgrace himself . so I will make myself easy ; and , indeed , I should never have be otherwise , if you have not put it into my head ; for my good , I know very well . but , may be , without these uneasiness to mingle with these benefit , I might be too much puffe up : so I will conclude , all that happen be for we good ; and bless you , my dear father and mother ; and I know you constantly pray for a blessing upon I ; who be , and shall always be , you dutiful daughter . , I can not but renew my caution on you master 's kindness , and he free expression to you about the stocking . yet there may not be , and I hope there be not , any thing in it . but when I reflect , that there possibly may , and that if there should , no less depend upon it than my child 's everlasting happiness in this world and the next ; it be enough to make one fearful for you . arm yourself , my dear child , for the worst ; and resolve to lose you life sooner than you virtue . what though the doubts I fill you with , lessen the pleasure you would have have in you master 's kindness ; yet what signify the delight that arise from a few paltry fine clothes , in comparison with a good conscience ? these be , indeed , very great favour that he heap upon you , but so much the more to be suspect ; and when you say he look so amiably , and like a angel , how afraid I be , that they should make too great a impression upon you ! for , though you be bless with sense and prudence above you year , yet I tremble to think , what a sad hazard a poor maiden of little more than fifteen year of age stand against the temptation of this world , and a designing young gentleman , if he should prove so , who have so much power to oblige , and have a kind of authority to command , as you master . I charge you , my dear child , on both we blessing , poor as we be , to be on you guard ; there can be no harm in that . and since be so good a gentlewoman , and so kind to you , I be the easier a great deal , and so be you mother ; and we hope you will hide nothing from she , and take she counsel in every thing . so , with we blessing , and assure prayer for you , more than for ourselves , we remain , you love Father and mother . be sure do not let people 's tell you , you be pretty , puff you up ; for you do not make yourself , and so can have no praise due to you for it . it be virtue and goodness only , that make the true beauty . remember that , . and , I be sorry to write you word , that the hope I have of go to wait on , be quite over . my lady would have have I ; but my master , as I hear by the by , would not consent to it . he say she nephew might be take with I , and I might draw he in , or be draw in by he ; and he think , as he mother love I , and commit I to he care , he ought to continue I with he ; and would be a mother to I . tell I the lady shook she head , and say , ah ! brother
brother ! and that be all . and as you have make I fearful by you caution , my heart at time misgive I . but I say nothing yet of you caution , or my own uneasiness , to ; not that I mistrust she , but for fear she should think I presumptuous , and vain and conceit , to have any fear about the matter , from the great distance between such a gentleman , and so poor a girl . but yet seem to build something upon 's shak she head , and say , ah ! brother ! and no more . God , I hope , will give I he grace : and so I will not , if I can help it , make myself too uneasy ; for I hope there be no occasion . but every little matter that happen , I will acquaint you with , that you may continue to I you good advice , and pray for you sad - hear PAMELa . , you and my good father may wonder you have not have a letter from I in so many week ; but a sad , sad scene , have be the occasion of it . for to be sure , now it be too plain , that all you caution be well grounde . of my dear mother ! I be miserable , truly miserable ! -- but yet , do not be frightene , I be honest ! -- , of he goodness , keep I so ! of this angel of a master ! this fine gentleman ! this gracious benefactor to you poor ! who be to take care of I at the prayer of he good dying mother ; who be so apprehensive for I , lest I should be draw in by 's nephew , that he would not let I go to 's : this very gentleman ( yes , I must call he gentleman , though he have fall from the merit of that title ) have degrad himself to offer freedom to he poor servant ! he have now shew himself in he true colour ; and , to I , nothing appear so black , and so frightful . I have not be idle ; but have writ from time to time , how he , by sly mean degree , expose he wick view ; but somebody steal my letter , and I know not what have become of it . it be a very long one . I fear , he that be mean enough to do bad thing , in one respect , do not stick at this . but be it as it will , all the use he can make of it will be , that he may be asham of he part ; I not of mine : for he will see I be resolve to be virtuous , and glory in the honesty of my poor parent . I will tell you all , the next opportunity ; for I be watch very narrowly ; and he say to , this girl be always scribbling ; I think she may be better employ . and yet I work all hour with my needle , upon he linen , and the fine linen of the family ; and am , besides , about flower he a waistcoat .-- but , oh ! my heart 's break almost ; for what be I likely to have for my reward , but shame and disgrace , or else ill word , and hard treatment ! I will tell you all soon , and hope I shall find my long letter . you must afflict daughter . - be , I he and he too much : but it be he own fault if I do . for why do he lose all he dignity with I ? , well , I can not find my letter , and so I will try to recollect it all , and be as brief as I can . all go well enough in the main for some time after my letter but one . at last , I see some reason to suspect ; for he would look upon I , whenever he see I , in such a manner , as shew not well ; and one day he come to I , as I be in the summer - house in the little garden , at work with my needle , and be just go from I ; and I would have go out , but he say , no do not go , ; I have something to say to you ; and you always fly I when I come near you , as if you be afraid of I . I be much out of countenance , you may well think ; but say , at last , it do not become you good servant to stay in you presence , sir , without you business require it ; and I hope I shall always know my place . well , say he , my business do require it sometimes ; and I have a mind you should stay to hear what I have to say to you . I stand still confound , and begin to tremble , and the more when he take I by the hand ; for now no soul be near we . my sister Davers , say he , ( and seem , I think , to be as much at a loss for word as I , ) would have have you live with she ; but she would not do for you what I be resolve to do , if you continue faithful and oblige . what say 'st thou , my girl ? say he , with some eagerness ; have 'st thou
thou not rather stay with I , than go to my sister Davers ? he look so , as fill I with affrightment ; I do not know how ; wildly , I think . I say , when I could speak , you honou will forgive I ; but as you have no lady for I to wait upon , and my good lady have be now dead this twelvemonth , I have rather , if it would not displease you , wait upon , because -- I be proceed , and he say , a little hastily -- because you be a little fool , and know not what be good for yourself . I tell you I will make a gentlewoman of you , if you be oblige , and do not stand in you own light ; and so say , he put he arm about I , and kiss I ! now , you will say , all he wickedness appear plainly . I struggle and tremble , and be so benumb with terror , that I sink down , not in a fit , and yet not myself ; and I find myself in he arm , quite void of strength ; and he kiss I two or three time , with frightful eagerness . -- at last I burst from he , and be get out of the summer - house ; but he hold I back , and shut the door . I would have give my life for a farthing . and he say , I will do you no harm , Pamela ; do not be afraid of I . I say , I will not stay . you will not , hussy ! say he : do you know whom you speak to ? I lose all fear , and all respect , and say , yes , I do , sir , too well !-- well may I forget that I be you servant , when you forget what belong to a master . I sob and cry most sadly . what a foolish hussy you be ! say he : have I do you any harm ? yes , sir , say I , the greatest harm in the world : you have teach I to forget myself and what belong to I , and have lessen the distance that fortune have make between we , by demean yourself , to be so free to a poor servant . yet , sir , I will be bold to say , I be honest , though poor : and if you be a prince , I would not be otherwise . he be angry , and say , who would have you otherwise , you foolish slut ! cease you blubbering . I own I have demean myself ; but it be only to try you . if you can keep this matter secret , you will give I the better opinion of you prudence ; and here be something , say he , put some gold in my hand , to make you amend for the fright I put you in . go , take a walk in the garden , and do not go in till you blubbering be over : and I charge you say nothing of what be past , and all shall be well , and I will forgive you . I will not take the money , indeed , sir , say I , poor as I be I will not take it . for , to say truth , I think it look like take earnest , and so I put it upon the bench ; and as he see vex and confuse at what he have do , I take the opportunity to open the door , and go out of the summer - house . he call to I , and say , be secret ; I charge you , ; and do not go in yet , as I tell you . of how poor and mean must those action be , and how little must they make the best of gentleman look , when they offer such thing as be unworthy of themselves , and put it into the power of they inferior to be greater than they ! I take a turn or two in the garden , but in sight of the house , for fear of the worst ; and breathe upon my hand to dry my eye , because I would not be too disobedient . my next shall tell you more . pray for I , my dear father and mother : and do not be angry I have not yet run away from this house , so late my comfort and delight , but now my terror and anguish . I be force to break off hastily . you dutiful and honest daughter . , well , I will now proceed with my sad story . and so , after I have dry my eye , I go in , and begin to ruminate with myself what I have best to do . sometimes I think I would leave the house and go to the next town , and wait a opportunity to get to you ; but then I be at a loss to resolve whether to take away the thing he have give I or no , and how to take they away : sometimes I think to leave they behind I , and only go with the clothes on my back , but then I have two mile and a half , and a byway , to the town ; and be pretty well dress , I might come to some harm , almost as bad as what I would run away from ; and then may - be , think I , it will be report , I
I have steal something , and so be force to run away ; and to carry a bad name back with I to my dear parent , would be a sad thing indeed !-- of how I wish for my grey russet again , and my poor honest dress , with which you fit I out , ( and hard enough too it be for you to do it ! ) for go to this place , when I be not twelve year old , in my good lady 's day ! sometimes I think of tell , and take she advice , and only fear he command to be secret ; for , think I , he may be asham of he action , and never attempt the like again : and as poor depend upon he , through misfortune , that have attend she , I think it would be a sad thing to bring he displeasure upon she for my sake . in this quandary , now consider , now cry , and not know what to do , I pass the time in my chamber till evening ; when desire to be excuse go to , come up to I , and say , why must I sup without you , ? come , I see you be trouble at something ; tell I what be the matter . I beg I might be permit to be with she on night ; for I be afraid of spirit , and they would not hurt such a good person as she . that be a silly excuse , she say ; for why be not you afraid of spirits before ?-- ( indeed I do not think of that . ) but you shall be my bed - fellow with all my heart , add she , let you reason be what it will ; only come down to supper . I beg to be excuse ; for , say I , I have be cry so , that it will be take notice of by my fellow - servants ; and I will hide nothing from you , , when we be alone . she be so good to indulge I ; but make haste to come up to bed ; and tell the servants , that I should be with she , because she could not rest well , and would get I to read she to sleep ; for she know I love reading , she say . when we be alone , I tell she all that have pass ; for I think , though he have bid I not , yet if he should come to know I have tell , it would be no worse ; for to keep a secret of such a nature , would be , as I apprehend , to deprive myself of the good advice which I never want more ; and might encourage he to think I do not resent it as I ink , and would keep worse secret , and so make he do worse by I . be I right , my dear mother ? could not help mingl tear with my tear ; for I cry all the time I be tell she the story , and beg she to advise I what to do ; and I shew she my dear father 's two letter , and she praise the honesty and enditing of they , and say pleasing thing to I of you both . but she beg I would not think of leave my service ; for , say she , in all likelihood , you behave so virtuously , that he will be asham of what he have do , and never offer the like to you again : though , my dear , say she , I fear more for you prettiness than for anything else ; because the best man in the land might love you : so she be pleased to say . she wish it be in she power to live independent ; then she would take a little private house , and I should live with she like she daughter . and so , as you order I to take she advice , I resolve to tarry to see how thing go , except he be to turn I away ; although , in you first letter , you order I to come away the moment I have any reason to be apprehensive . so , dear father and mother , it be not disobedience , I hope , that I stay ; for I could not expect a blessing , or the good fruit of you prayer for I , if I be disobedient . all the next day i be very sad , and begin my long letter . he see I write , and say ( as I mention ) to , that girl be always scribbling ; methink she might find something else to do , or to that purpose . and when I have finish my letter , I put it under the toilet in my late lady 's dressing - room , whither nobody come but myself and , besides my master ; but when I come up again to seal it , to my great concern , it be go ; and kknow nothing of it ; and nobody know of my master 's have be near the place in the time ; so I have be sadly trouble about it : but , as well as I , think he have it , some how or other ; and he appear cross and angry , and seem to shin I , as much as he say I do he . it have better be so than worse ! but he have order to bid I not pass so much time in writing ; which be
be a poor matter for such a gentleman as he to take notice of , as I be not idle other way , if he do not resent what he think I write upon . and this have no very good look . but I be a good deal easier since I lie with ; though , after all , the fear I live in on one side , and he frown and displeasure at what I do on the other , make I more miserable than enough . of that I have never leave my little bed in the loft , to be thus expose to temptation on one hand , or disgust on the other ! how happy be I awhile ago ! how contrary now !-- Pity and pray for you afflict . letter xiii my Dearest child , we heart bleed for you distress , and the temptation you be expose to . you have we hourly prayer ; and we would have you flee this evil great house and man , if you find he renew he attempt . you ought to have do it at first , have you not have to advise with . we can find no fault in you conduct hitherto : but it make we heart ache for fear of the worst . of my child ! temptation be sore thing , -- but yet , without they , we know not ourselves , nor what we be able to do . you danger be very great ; for you have riche , youth , and a fine gentleman , as the world reckon he , to withstand ; but how great will be you honour to withstand they ! and when we consider you past conduct , and you virtuous education , and that you have be breed to be more asham of dishonesty than poverty , we trust in , that he will enable you to overcome . yet , as we can not see but you life must be a burthan to you , through the great apprehension always upon you ; and that it may be presumptuous to trust too much to we own strength ; and that you be but very young ; and the devil may put it into he heart to use some stratagem , of which great man be full , to decoy you : I think you have better come home to share we poverty with safety , than live with so much discontent in a plenty , that itself may be dangerous . direct you for the best ! while you have for a adviser and bed - fellow , ( and , of my dear child ! that be prudently do of you , ) we be easier than we should be ; and so commit you to the divine protection , remain you truly love , but careful , Father and mother . and , and I have liv very comfortably together for this fortnight past ; for my master be all that time at he estate , and at he sister 's , the Lady Davers . but he come home yesterday . he have some talk with soon after , and mostly about I . he say to she , it seem , well , , I know have you good word ; but do you think she of any use in the family ? she tell I she be surprised at the question , but say , that I be one of the most virtuous and industrious young creature that ever she know . why that word virtuous , say he , I pray you ? be there any reason to suppose she otherwise ? or have any body take it into he head to try she ?-- I wonder , sy , say she , you ask such a question ! who dare offer any thing to she in such a orderly and well - governed house as yours , and under a master of so good a character for virtue and honour ? you servant , , say he , for you good opinion : but pray , if any body do , do you think would let you know it ? why , sir , say she , she be a poor innocent young creature , and I believe have so much confidence in I , that she would take my advice as soon as she would she mother 's . innocent ! again , and virtuous , I warrant ! well , , you abound with you epithet ; but I take she to be a artful young baggage ; and have I a young handsome butler or steward , she would soon make she market of one of they , if she think it worth while to snap at he for a husband . - a - day , sir , say she , it be early day with ; and she do not yet think of a husband , I dare say : and you steward and butler be both man in year , and think nothing of the matter . no , say he , if they be younger , they would have more wit than to think of such a girl ; I will tell you my mind of she , : I do not think this same favourite of yours so very artless a girl as you imagine . I be not to dispute with you honour , say ; but I dare say , if the man will let she alone , she will never trouble herself about they . why , , say he , be there any man that will not let she alone , that you know of ? no , indeed , sir , say she ; she keep herself so much to herself , and yet behave so prudently , that
that they all esteem she , and show she as great a respect as if she be a gentlewoman bear . ay , say he , that be she art , that I be speak of : but , let I tell you , the girl have vanity and conceit , and pride too , or I be mistaken ; and , perhaps , I could give you a instance of it . , say she , you can see farther than such a poor silly woman as I be ; but I never see any thing but innocence in she -- and virtue too , I will warrant ye ! say he . but suppose I could give you a instance , where she have talk a little too freely of the kindness that have be shew she from a certain quarter ; and have have the vanity to impute a few kind word , uttere in mere compassion to she youth and circumstance , into a design upon she , and even da to make free with name that she ought never to mention but with reverence and gratitude ; what would you say to that ? -- , sir ! say she , I can not tell what to say . but I hope incapable of such ingratitude . well , no more of this silly girl , say he ; you may only advise she , as you be she friend , not to give herself too much licence upon the favour she meet with ; and if she stay here , that she will not write the affair of my family purely for a exercise to she pen , and she invention . I tell you she be a subtle , artful gipsy , and time will show it you . be ever the like heard , my dear father and mother ? it be plain he do not expect to meet with such a repulse , and mistrust that I have tell , and have my long letter too , that I intend for you ; and so be vex to the heart . but I can not help it . I have better be think artful and subtle , than be so , in he sense ; and , as light as he make of the word virtue and innocence in I , he would have make a less angry construction , have I less deserve that he should do so ; for then , may be , my crime should have be my virtue with he naughty gentleman as he be ! I will soon write again ; but must now end with say , that I be , and shall always be , you honest daughter . , I break off abruptly my last letter ; for I fear he be come ; and so it happen . I put the letter in my bosom , and take up my work , which lay by I ; but I have so little of the artful , as he call it , that I look as confused as if I have be do some great harm . sit still , , say he , mind you work , for all I .-- you do not tell I I be welcome home , after my journey to . it would be hard , sir , say I , if you be not always welcome to you honour 's own house . I would have go ; but he say , do not run away , I tell you . I have a word or two to say to you . good sir , how my heart go pit - a - pat ! when I be a little kind to you , say he , in the summer - house , and you carry yourself so foolishly upon it , as if I have intend to do you great harm , do I not tell you you should take no notice of what pass to any creature ? and yet you have make a common talk of the matter , not consider either my reputation , or you own .-- I make a common talk of it , sir ! say I : I have nobody to talk to , hardly . he interrupt I , and say , hardly ! you little equivocator ! what do you mean by hardly ? let I ask you , have not you tell for one ? pray you honour , say I , all in agitation , let I go down ; for it be not for I to hold a argument with you honour . , again ! say he , and take my hand , what do you talk of a argument ? be it hold a argument with I to answer a plain question ? answer I what I ask . of , good sir , say I , let I beg you will not urge I farther , for fear I forget myself again , and be saucy . answer I then , I bid you , say he , have you not tell ? it will be saucy in you if you do not answer I directly to what I ask . , say I , and fain would have pull my hand away , perhaps I should be for answer you by another question , and that would not become I . what be it you would say ? reply he ; speak out . then , sir , say I , why should you honour be so angry I should tell , or any body else , what pass , if you intend no harm ? well say , pretty innocent and artless ! as call you , say he ; and be it thus you taunt and retort upon I , insolent as you be ! but still
still I will be answer directly to my question . why then , sir , say I , I will not tell a lie for the world : I do tell ; for my heart be almost break ; but I open not my mouth to any other . very well , boldface , say he , and equivocator again ! you do not open you mouth to any other ; but do not you write to some other ? why , now , and please you honour , say I , ( for I be quite courageous just then , ) you could not have ask I this question , if you have not take from I my letter to my father and mother , in which I own I have break my mind freely to they , and ask they advice , and pour forth my grief ! and so I be to be expose , be I , say he , in my own house , and out of my house , to the whole world , by such a sauce - box as you ? no , good sir , say I , and I hope you honou will not be angry with I ; it be not I that expose you , if I say nothing but the truth . so , taunt again ! Assurance as you be ! say he : I will not be thus talk to ! pray , sir , say I , of whom can a poor girl take advice , if it must not be of she father and mother , and such a good woman as , who , for she sex -ake , should give it I when ask ? Insolence ! say he , and stamp with he foot , be I to be question thus by such a one as you ? I fall down on my knee , and say , for 's sake , you honour , pity a poor creature , that know nothing of she duty , but how to cherish she virtue and good name : I have nothing else to trust to : and , though poor and friendless here , yet I have always be teach to value honesty above my life . here be adue with you honesty , say he , foolish girl ! be it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to you master , do you think ? indeed , sir , say I , it be impossible I should be ungrateful to you honour , or disobedient , or deserve the name of bold - face or insolent , which you call I , but when you command be contrary to that first duty which shall ever be the principle of my life ! he seem to be move , and rise up , and walk into the great chamber two or three turn , leave I on my knee ; and I throw my apron over my face , and lay my head on a chair , and cry as if my heart would break , have no power to stir . at last he come in again , but , alas ! with mischief in he heart ! and raise I up , he say , rise , , rise ; you be you own enemy . you perverse folly will be you ruin : I tell you this , that I be very much displease with the freedom you have take with my name to my housekeeper , as also to you father and mother ; and you may as well have real cause to take these freedom with I , as to make my name suffer for imaginary one . and say so , he offer to take I on he knee , with some force . of how I be terrify ! I say , like as I have read in a book a night or two before , Angels and saint , and all the host of heaven , defend I ! and may I never survive one moment that fatal one in which I shall forfeit my innocence ! pretty fool ! say he , how will you forfeit you innocence , if you be oblige to yield to a force you can not withstand ? be easy , say he ; for let the worst happen that can , you will have the merit , and I the blame ; and it will be a good subject for letter to you father and mother , and a tale into the bargain for . he by force kiss my neck and lip ; and say , whoever blame ? all the shame lay on the ravisher only and I be content to take all the blame upon I , as I have already borne too great a share for what I have not deserve . may I , say I , like , justify myself with my death , if I be use barbarously ! of my good girl ! say he , tauntingly , you be well read , I see ; and we shall make out between we , before we have do , a pretty story in romance , I warrant ye . he then put he hand in my bosom , and indignation give I double strength , and I get loose from he by a sudden spring , and run out of the room ! and the next chamber be open , I make shift to get into it , and throw to the door , and it lock after I ; but he follow I so close , he get hold of my gown , and tore a piece off , which hang without the door ; for the key be on the inside . I just remember I get into the room ; for I
I know nothing further of the matter till afterwards ; for I fall into a fit with my terror , and there I lay , till he , as I suppose , look through the key - hole , spy I upon the floor , stretch out at length , on my face ; and then he call to I , who , by he assistance , burst open the door , he go away , see I come to myself ; and bid she say nothing of the matter , if she be wise . poor think it be worse , and cry over I like as if she be my mother ; and I be two hour before I come to myself ; and just as I get a little up on my foot , he come in , I faint away again with the terror ; and so he withdraw : but he stay in the next room to let nobody come near we , that he foul proceedings might not be know . give I she smell - bottle , and have cut my lace , and set I in a great chair , and he call she to he : how be the girl ? say he : I never see such a fool in my life . I do nothing at all to she . could not speak for crying . so he say , she have tell you , it seem , that I be kind to she in the summer - house , though I will assure you , I be quite innocent then as well as now ; and I desire you to keep this matter to yourself , and let I not be name in it . o , sir , say she , for you honour 's sake , and for 's sake ! -- but he would not hear she , and say -- for you own sake , I tell you , , say not a word more . I have do she no harm . and I will not have she stay in my house ; prating , perverse fool , as she be ! but since she be so apt to fall into fit , or at least pretend to do so , prepare she to see I to - morrow after dinner , in my mother 's closet , and do you be with she , and you shall hear what pass between we . and so he go out in a pet , and order he chariot and four to be get ready , and go a visiting somewhere . then come to I , and I tell she all that have happen , and say , I be resolve not to stay in the house : and she reply , he seem to threat as much ; I say , I be glad of that ; then I shall be easy . so she tell I all he have say to she , as above . be very loath I should go ; and yet , poor woman ! she begin to be afraid for herself ; but would not have I ruin for the world . she say to be sure he mean no good ; but may be , now he see I so resolute , he will give over all attempt ; and that I shall better know what to do after tomorrow , when I be to appear before a very bad judge , I doubt . of how I dread this to - morrow 's appearance ! but be as assu , my dear parent , of the honesty of you poor child , as I be of you prayer for you dutiful daughter . of this frightful to - morrow ; how I dread it ! my , I know you long to hear from I soon ; and I send you as soon as I could . well , you may believe how uneasily I pass the time , till he appoint hour come . every minute , as it grow nearer , my terror increase ; and sometimes I have great courage , and sometimes none at all ; and I think I should faint when it come to the time my master have dine . I could neither eat nor drink , for my part ; and do what I could , my eye be swell with crying . at last he go up to the closet , which be my good lady 's dressing - room ; a room I once love , but then as much hate . do not you heart aco for I ?-- I be sure mine flutter about like a new - catch bird in a cage . of , say I to myself , why be thou so foolish and fearful ? thou hast do no harm ! what , if thou fearest a unjust judge , when thou be innocent , would 'st thou do before a just one , if thou wert guilty ? have courage , Pamela , thou knowest the worst ! and how easy a choice poverty and honesty be , rather than plenty and wickedness . so I cheer myself ; but yet my poor heart sunk , and my spirit be quite broken . everything that stir , I think be to call I to my account . I dread it , and yet I wish it to come . well , at last he ring the bell : o , think I , that it be my passing - bell ! go up , with a full heart enough , poor good woman ! he say , 's ? let she come up , and do you come with she . she come to I : I be ready to go with my foot ; but my heart be
be with my dear father and mother , wish to share you poverty and happiness . I go up , however . of how can wick man seem so steady and untouched with such black heart , while poor innocent stand like malefactor before they ! he look so stern , that my heart fail I , and I wish myself any where but there , though I have before be summon up all my courage . , say I to myself , give I courage to stand before this naughty master ! of soften he , or hare I ! come in , fool , say he , angrily , as soon as he see I ; ( and snatch my hand with a pull ;) you may well be asham to see I , after you noise and nonsense , and expose I as you have do . I asham to see you ! think I : very pretty indeed ! -- but I say nothing . , say he , here you be both together . do you sit down ; but let she stand , if she will . ay , think I , if I can ; for my knee beat one against the other . do you not think , when you see the girl in the way you find she in , that I have give she the greatest occasion for complaint , that could possibly be give to a woman ? and that I have actually ruin she , as she call it ? tell I , could you think any thing less ? indeed , say she , I fear so at first . have she tell you what I do to she , and all I do to she , to occasion all this folly , by which my reputation might have suffer in you opinion , and in that of all the family .-- inform I , what she have tell you ? she be a little too much frightened , as she own afterwards , at he sternness , and say , indeed she tell I you only pull she on you knee , and kiss she . then I pluck up my spirit a little . only ! ? say I ; and be not that enough to show I what I have to fear ? when a master of he honour 's degree demean himself to be so free as that to such a poor servant as I , what be the next to be expect ?--but you honour go farther , so you do ; and threaten I what you would do , and talk of , and she hard fate . -- you honour know you go too far for a master to a servant , or even to he equal ; and I can not bear it . so I fall a crying most sadly . begin to excuse I , and to beg he would pity a poor maiden , that have such a value for she reputation . he say , I speak it to she face , I think she very pretty , and I think she humble , and one that would not grow upon my favour , or the notice I take of she ; but I abhor the thought of force she to any thing . I know myself better , say he , and what belong to I : and to be sure I have enough demean myself to take notice of such a one as she ; but I be bewitch by she , I think , to be freer than become I ; though I have no intention to carry the jest farther . what poor stuff be all this , my dear mother , from a man of he sense ! but see how a bad cause and bad action confound the greatest wit !-- it give I a little more courage then ; for innocence , I find , in a low fortune , and weak mind , have many advantage over guilt , with all its riche and wisdom . so I say , you honour may call this jest or sport , or what you please ; but indeed , sir , it be not a jest that become the distance between a master and a servant . do you hear , ? say he : do you hear the pertness of the creature ? I have a good deal of this sort before in the summer - house , and yesterday too , which make I rougher with she than perhaps I have otherwise be . , , do not be so pert to he honour : you should know you distance ; you see he honour be only in jest .-- of dear , say I , do not you blame I too . it be very difficult to keep one 's distance to the greatest of man , when they will not keep it themselves to they meanest servants . see again ! say he ; could you believe this of the young baggage , if you have not hear it ? Gand you honour , say the well - mean gentlewoman , pity and forgive the poor girl ; she be but a girl , and she virtue be very dear to she ; and I will pawn my life for she , she will never be pert to you honour , if you will be so good as to molest she no more , nor frighten she again . you see , sir , by she fit , she be in terror ; she could not help it ; and though you honou intend she no harm , yet the apprehension be almost death to she : and I have much ado to bring she to herself again . of the little hypocrite ! say he
he ; she have all the art of she sex ; they be bear with she ; and I tell you a while ago you do not know she . but this be not the reason principally of my call you before I together . I find I be likely to suffer in my reputation by the perverseness and folly of this girl . she have tell you all , and perhaps more than all ; nay , I make no doubt of it ; and she have write letter ( for I find she be a mighty letter- writer ! ) to she father and mother , and other , as far as I know , in which represent herself as a angel of light , she make she kind master and benefactor , a devil incarnate -- ( o how people will sometimes , think I , call themselves by they right name ! ) --And all this , add he , I will not hear ; and so I be resolve she shall return to the distress and poverty she be take from ; and let she be careful how she use my name with freedom , when she be go from I . I be brighten up at once with these welcome word , and I throw myself upon my knee at he foot , with a most sincere glad heart ; and I say , may you honour be for ever bless for you resolution ! now I shall be happy . and permit I , on my bended knee , to thank you for all the benefit and favour you have heape upon I ; for the opportunity I have have of improvement and learn , through my good lady 's mean , and yours . I will now forget all you honour have offer I : and I promise you , that I will never let you name pass my lip , but with reverence and gratitude : and so bless you honour , for ever and ever ! amen . then rise from my knee , I go away with another - guise sort of heart than I come into he presence with : and so I fall to write this letter . and thus all be happily over . and now , my dearest father and mother , expect to see soon you poor daughter , with a humble and dutiful mind , return to you : and do not fear but I know how to be as happy with you as ever : for I will be in the loft , as I use to do ; and pray let my little bed be get ready ; and I have a small matter of money , which will buy I a suit of clothes , fitter for my condition than what I have ; and I will get to help I to some needle - work : and fear not that I shall be a burden to you , if my health continue . I know I shall be bless , if not for my own sake , for both you sake , who have , in all you trials and misfortune , preserve so much integrity as make every body speak well of you both . but I hope he will let good give I a character , for fear it should be think that I be turn away for dishonesty . and so , my dear parent , may you be blest for I , and I for you ! and I will always pray for my master and . so good night ; for it be late , and I shall be soon call to bed . I hope be not angry with I . she have not call I to supper : though i could eat nothing if she have . but I make no doubt I shall sleep purely to - night , and dream that I be with you , in my dear , dear , happy loft once more . so good night again , my dear father and mother , say you poor honest daughter . perhaps I may not come this week , because I must get up the linen , and leave in order every thing belong to my place . so send I a line , if you can , to let I know if I shall be welcome , by , who will call for it as he return . but say nothing of my come away to he , as yet : for it will be say I blab every thing . letter Xvii my Dearest daughter , welcome , welcome , ten time welcome shall you be to we ; for you come to we innocent , and happy , and honest ; and you be the staff of we old age , and we comfort . and though we can not do for you as we would , yet , fear not , we shall live happily together ; and what with my diligent labour , and you poor mother 's spinning , and you needle - work , I make no doubt we shall do better and better . only you poor mother 's eye begin to fail she ; though , I bless , I be as strong and able , and willing to labour as ever ; and , of my dear child ! you virtue have make I , I think , stronger and better than I be before . what bless thing be trials and temptation , when we have the strength to resist and subdue they ! but I be uneasy about those same four guinea ; I think you should give they back again to you master ; and yet I have break they . ! I have only three left ; but I will borrow the fourth ,
, if I can , part upon my wage , and part of , and send the whole sum back to you , that you may return it , against come next , if he come again before you . I want to know how you come . I fancy honest will be glad to bear you company part of the way , if you master be not so cross as to forbid he . and if I know time enough , you mother will go one five mile , and I will go ten on the way , or till I meet you , as far as one holiday will go ; for that I can get leave to make on such a occasion . and we shall receive you with more pleasure than we have at you birth , when all the worst be over ; or than we ever have in we life . and so God bless you till the happy time come ! say both you mother and I , which be all at present , from you truly love parent . and , I thank you a thousand tine for you goodness to I , express in you last letter . I now long to get my business do , and come to my new old lot again , as I may call it . I have be quite another thing since my master have turn I off : and as I shall come to you a honest daughter , what pleasure it be to what I should have have , if I could not have see you but as a guilty one . well , my writing - time will soon be over , and so I will make use of it now , and tell you all that have happene since my last letter . I wonder do not call I to sup with she , and fear she be angry ; and when I have finish my letter , I longe for she come to be . at last she come up , but seem shy and reserve ; and I say , my dear , I be glad to see you : you be not angry with I , I hope . she say she be sorry thing have go so far ; and that she have a great deal of talk with my master , after I be gone ; that he see move at what I say , and at my falling on my knee to he , and my prayer for he , at my go away . he say I be a strange girl ; he know not what to make of I . and be she gone ? say he : I intend to say something else to she ; but she behave so oddly , that I have not power to stop she . she ask , if she should call I again ? he say , yes ; and then , no , let she go ; it be best for she and I too ; and she shall go , now I have give she warning . where she have it , I can not tell ; but I never meet with the fellow of she in any life , at any age . she say , he have order she not to tell I all : but she believe he would never offer any thing to I again ; and I might stay , she fancie , if I would beg it as a favour ; though she be not sure neither . I stay ! dear ; say I ; why it be the best news that could have come to I , that he will let I go . I do nothing but long to go back again to my poverty and distress , as he threaten I should ; for though I be sure of the poverty , I shall not have half the distress I have have for some month past , I will assure you . , dear good soul ! weep over I , and say , well , well , , I do not think I have shewn so little love to you , as that you should express so much joy upon leave I . I be sure I never have a child half so dear to I as you be . I go to hear she so good to I , as indeed she have always be , and say , what would you have I to do , dear ? I love you next to my own father and mother , and to leave you be the chief concern I have at quit this place ; but I be sure it be certain ruin if I stay . after such offer , and such threatening , and he compare himself to a wicked ravisher in the very time of he last offer ; and turn it into a jest , that we should make a pretty story in a romance ; can I stay and be safe ? have he not demean himself twice ? and it behove I to beware of the third time , for fear he should lay he snare surer ; for perhaps he do not expect a poor servant would resist she master so much . and must it not be look upon as a sort of warrant for such action , if I stay after this ? for , I think , when one of we sex finds she be attempt , it be a encouragement to the attempter to proceed , if one put one 's self in the way of it , when one can help it : ' Tis neither more nor less than invite he to think that one forgive , what , in short , ought not to be forgive :
: which be no small countenance to foul action , I will assure you . she hug I to she , and say I will assure you ! pretty -face , where gottest thou all thy knowledge , and thy good notion , at these year ? thou be a miracle for thy age , and I shall always love thee . -- but , do you resolve to leave we , ? yes , my dear , say I ; for , as matter stand , how can I do otherwise ? --but I will finish the duty of my place first , if I may ; and hope you will give I a character , as to my honesty , that it may not he think I be turn away for any harm . ay , that I will , say she ; I will give thee such a character as never girl at thy year deserve . and I be sure , say I , I will always love and honour you , as my third - best friend , wherever I go , or whatever become of I . and so we go to bed ; and I never wake till ' twa time to rise ; which I do as blithey as a bird , and go about my business with great pleasure . but I believe my master be fearfully angry with I ; for he pass by I two or three time , and would not speak to I ; and towards evening , he meet I in the passage , go into the garden , and say such a word to I as I never hear in my life from he to man , woman , or child ; for he first say , this creature 's always in the way , I think . I say , stand up as close as I could , ( and the entry be wide enough for a coach too , ) I hope I sha not be long in you honour 's way . d -- mn you ! say he , ( that be the hard word , ) for a little witch ; I have no patience with you . I profess I tremble to hear he say so ; but I see he be vex ; and , as I be go away , I mind it the less . well ! I see , my dear parent , that when a person will do wick thing , it be no wonder he will speak wick word . may keep I out of the way of they both ! you dutiful daughter . and , Our have a opportunity to go you way , I write again , and send both letter at once . I can not say , yet , when I shall get away , nor how I shall come , because shew my master the waistcoat I be flower for he , and he say , it look well enough : I think the creature have best stay till she have finish it . there be some private talk carry on betwixt he and , that she do not tell I of ; but yet she be very kind to I , and I do not mistrust she at all . I should be very base if I do . but to be sure she must oblige he , and keep all he lawful command ; and other , I dare say , she will not keep : she be too good ; and love I too well ; but she must stay when I be go , and so must get no ill will . she have be at I again to ask to stay , and humble myself . but what have I do , ? say I : if I have be a sauce - box , and a bold - face , and a pert , and a creature , as he call I , have I not have reason ? do you think I should ever have forgot myself , if he have not forget to act as my master ? tell I from you own heart , dear , say I , if you think I could stay and be safe : what would you think , or how would you act in my case ? my dear , say she , and kiss I , I do not know how I should act , or what I should think . I hope I should act as you do . but I know nobody else that would . my master be a fine gentleman ; he have a great deal of wit and sense , and be admired , as I know , by half a dozen lady , who would think themselves happy in he address . he have a noble estate ; and yet I believe he love my good maiden , though he servant , better than all the lady in the land ; and he have try to overcome it , because you be so much he inferior ; and ' ti my opinion he find he can not ; and that vex he proud heart , and make he resolve you sha not stay ; and so he speak so cross to you , when he see you by accident . well , but , , say I , let I ask you , if he can stoop to like such a poor girl as I , as perhaps he may , ( for I have read of thing almost as strange , from great man to poor damsel , ) what can it be for ?-- he may condescmend , perhaps , to think I may be good enough for he harlot ; and those thing do not disgrace man that ruin poor woman , as
as the world go . and so if I be wick enough , he would keep I till I be undone , and till he mind change ; for even wick man , I have read , soon grow weary of wickedness with the same person , and love variety . well , then , poor must be turn off , and look upon as a vile abandon creature , and every body would despise she ; ay , and justly too , ; for she that can not keep she virtue , ought to live in disgrace . but , , I continue , let I tell you , that I hope , if I be sure he would always be kind to I , and never turn I off at all , that I shall have so much grace , as to hate and withstand he temptation , be he not only my master , but my king : and that for the sin 's sake . this my poor dear parent have always teach I ; and I should be a sad wicked creature indeed , if , for the sake of riche or favour , I should forfeit my good name ; yea , and worse than any other young body of my sex ; because I can so contentedly return to my poverty again , and think it a less disgrace to be oblige to wear rag , and live upon rye - bread and water , as I use to do , than to be a harlot to the greatest man in the world . lift up she hand , and have she eye full of tear . bless you , my dear love ! say she ; you be my admiration and delight .-- how shall I do to part with you ! well , good , say I , let I ask you now :-- you and he have have some talk , and you may not be suffer to tell I all . but , do you think , if I be to ask to stay , that he be sorry for what he have do ? ay , and asham of it too ? for I be sure he ought , consider he high degree , and my low degree , and how I have nothing in the world to trust to but my honesty : do you think in you own conscience now , ( pray answer I truly , ) that he would never offer any thing to I again , and that I could be safe ? ! my dear child , say she , do not put thy home question to I , with that pretty become earnestness in thy look . I know this , that he be vex at what he have do ; he be vex the first time , more vex the second time . yes , say I , and so he will be vex , I suppose , the third , and the fourth time too , till he have quite ruin you poor maiden ; and who will have cause to be vex then ? , , say she , do not imagine that I would be accessory to you ruin for the world . I only can say , that he have , yet , do you no hurt ; and it be no wonder he should love you , you be so pretty ; though so much beneath he but , I dare swear for he , he never will offer you any force . you say , say I , that he be sorry for he first offer in the summer - house . well , and how long do he sorrow last ?-- only till he find I by myself ; and then he be worse than before : and so become sorry again . and if he have deign to love I , and you say can not help it , why , he can not help it neither , if he should have a opportunity , a third time to distress I . and I have read that many a man have be asham of he wicked attempt , when he have be repulse , that would never have be asham of they , have he succeed . besides , , if he really intend to offer no force , what do that mean ?-- while you say he can not help like I , for love it can not be -- do it not imply that he hope to ruin I by my own consent ? I think , say I , ( and hope I should have to do so , ) that I should not give way to he temptation on any account ; but it would be very presumptuous in I to rely upon my own strength against a gentleman of he qualifications and estate , and who be my waster ; and think himself entitle to call I bold - face , and what not ? only for stand on my necessary defence : and that , too , where the good of my soul and body , and my duty to , and my parent , be all concerned . how then , , say I , can I ask or wish to stay ? well , well , say she ; as he seem very desirous you should not stay , I hope it be from a good motive ; for fear he should be temp to disgrase himself as well as you . no , no , , say I ; I have think of that too ; for I would be glad to consider he with that duty that become I : but then he would have let I go to , and not have hinder my preferment : and he would not have say
say , I should return to my poverty and distress , when , by he mother 's goodness , I have be lift out of it ; but that he intend to fright I , and punish I , as he think , for not comply with he wickedness : and this shew I well enough what I have to expect from he future goodness , except I will deserve it at he own dear price . she be silent ; and I add , well , there be no more to be say ; I must go , that be certain : all my concern will be how to part with you : and , indeed , after you , with every body ; for all my fellow - servants have love I , and you and they will cost I a sigh , and a tear too , now and then , I be sure . and so I fall a crying : I could not help it . for it be a pleasant thing to one to be in a house among a great many fellow - servant , and be belove by they all . Nay , I should have tell you before now , how kind and civil we steward be ; vastly courteous , indeed , on all occasion ! and he say once to , he wish he be a young man for my sake ; I should be he wife , and he would settle all he have upon I on marriage ; and , you must know , he be reckon worth a power of money . I take no pride in this ; but bless , and you good example , my dear parent , that I have be enable so to carry myself , as to have every body 's good word ; not but we cook one day , who be a little snappish and cross sometimes , say once to I , why this Pamela of ours go as fine as a lady . see what it be to have a fine face !-- I wonder what the girl will come to at last ! she be hot with she work ; and I sneak away ; for I seldom go down into the kitchen ; and I hear the butler say , why , , nobody have you good word : what have do to you ? I be sure she offend nobody . and what , say the peevish wench , have I say to she , foolatum ; but that she be pretty ? they quarrell afterwards , I hear : I be sorry for it , but troublead myself no more about it . forgive this silly prattle , from you dutiful daughter . oh ! I forget to say , that I would stay to finish the waistcoat , if I might with safety . tell I I certainly may . I never do a prettier piece of work ; and I be up early and late to get it over ; for I long to be with you . and , I do not send my last letter so soon as I hope , because ( whether my master mistrust or no , I can not say ) have be send to 's instead of , who use to go ; and I could not be so free with , nor so well trust ; though he be very civil to I too . so I be force to stay till return . as I may not have opportunity to send again soon , and yet , as I know you keep my letter , and read they over and over , ( so tell I , ) when you have do work , ( so much do you kindness make you love all that come from you poor daughter , ) and as it may be some little pleasure to I , perhaps , to read they myself , when I be come to you , to remind I of what I have go through , and how great 's goodness have be to I , ( which , I hope , will further strengthen my good resolutions , that I may not hereafter , from my bad conduct , have reason to condemn myself from my own hand as it be ) : for all these reason , I say , I will write as I have time , and as matter happen , and send the scribble to you as I have opportunity ; and if I do not every time , in form , subscribe as I ink , I be sure you will always believe , that it be not for want off duty . so I will begin where I leave off , about the talk between and I , for I to ask to stay . unknown to , I put a project , as I may call it , in practice . I think with myself some day ago , here I shall go home to my poor father and mother , and have nothing on my back , that will be fit for my condition ; for how should you poor daughter look with a silk night - gown , silken petticoat , cambric head - clothes , fine holland linen , lace shoe that be my lady 's ; and fine stocking ! and how in a little while must these have look , like old cast - off , indeed , and I look so for wear they ! and people would have say , ( for poor folk be envious as well as rich , ) see there 's daughter , turn home from she fine place ! what a tawdry figure she make ! and how well that garb become she poor parent ' circumstance ! -- and how
how would they look upon I , think I to myself , when they should come to be threadbare and wear out ? and how should I look , even if I could purchase homespun clothes , to dwindle into they one by one , as I get they ?-- May be , a old silk gown , and a linsey - woolsey petticoat , and the like . so , think I , I have better get myself at once equip in the dress that will become my condition ; and though it may look but poor to what I have be use to wear of late day , yet it will serve I , when I be with you , for a good holiday and suit ; and what , by a blessing on my industry , I may , perhaps , make shift to keep up to . so , as I be say , unknown to any body , I buy of farmer 's wife and daughter a good sad - coloured stuff , of they own spinning , enough to make I a gown and two petticoat ; and I make robing and facing of a pretty bit of printed calico I have by I . I have a pretty good camblet quilted coat , that I think might do tolerably well ; and I buy two flannel undercoat ; not so good as my swanskin and fine linen one , but what will keep I warm , if any neighbour should get I to go out to help them to milk , now and then , as sometimes I use to do formerly ; for I be resolve to do all you good neighbour what kindness I can ; and hope to make myself as much belove about you , as I be here . I get some pretty good Scotch cloth , and make I , of morning and night , when nobody see I , two shift ; and I have enough leave for two shirt , and two shift , for you my dear father and mother . when I come home , I will make they for you , and desire you acceptance . then I buy of a pedlar , two pretty enough round - eare cap , a little straw - hat , and a pair of knit mitten , turn up with white calico ; and two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose , that make a smartish appearance , with white clock , I will assure you ; and two yard of black riband for my shift sleeve , and to serve as a necklace ; and when I have th'ey all come home , I go and look upon they once in two hour , for two day together : for , you must know , though I be with , I keep my own little apartment still for my clothes , and nobody go thither but myself . you will say I be no bad housewife to have save so much money ; but my dear good lady be always give I something . I believe myself the more obliged to do this , because , as I be turn away for what my good master think want of duty ; and as he expect other return for he present , than I intend to make he , so I think it be but just to leave he present behind I when I go away ; for , you know , if I would not earn he wage , why should I have they ? do not trouble yourself about the four guinea , nor borrow to make they up ; for they be give I , with some silver , as I tell you , as a perquisite , be what my lady have about she when she die ; and , as I hope for no wage , I be so vain as to think I have deserve all that money in the fourteen month , since my lady 's death , for she , good soul , overpay I before , in learning and other kindness . have she liv , none of these thing might have happen ! -- but I ought to be thankful ' ti no worse . every thing will turn about for the best : that be my confidence . so , as I be say , I have provide a new and more suitable dress , and I long to appear in it , more than ever I do in any new clothes in my life : for then I shall be soon after with you , and at ease in my mind -- but , mum ! here he come , I believe .-- I be , etc . my and , I be force to break off : for I fear my master be come : but it prove to be only . she say , I can not endure you should be so much by yourself , . and I , say I , dread nothing so much as company ; for my heart be up at my mouth now , for fear my master be come . but I always rejoice to see dear . say she , I have have a world of talk with my master about you . I be sorry for it , say I , that I be make of so much consequence as to be talk of by he . o , say she , I must not tell you all ; but you be of more consequence to he than you think for ---- or wish for , say I ; for the fruit of be of consequence to he , would make I of none to myself , or any body else . say she , Thou art as witty as any lady in
in the land ; I wonder where thou gottest it . but they must be poor lady , with such great opportunity , I be sure , if they have no more wit than I .--But let that pass . I suppose , say I , that I be of so much consequence , however , as to vex he , if it be but to think he can not make a fool of such a one as I ; and that be nothing at all , but a rebuke to the pride of he high condition , which he do not expect , and know not how to put up with . there be something in that , may be , say she : but , indeed , , he be very angry with you too ; and call you twenty perverse thing ; wonder at he own folly , to have shewn you so much favour , as he call it ; which he be first inclin to , he say , for he mother 's sake , and would have persist to show you for you own , if you be not you own enemy . Nay , now I sha not love you , , say I ; you be go to persuade I to ask to stay , though you know the hazard I run .-- no , say she , he say you shall go ; for he think it will not be for he reputation to keep you : but he wish ( do not speak of it for the world , , ) that he know a lady of birth , just such another as yourself , in person and mind , and he would marry she to - morrow . I colou up to the ear at this word : but say , yet , if I be the lady of birth , and he would offer to be rude first , as he have twice do to poor I , I do not know whether I would have he : for she that can bear a insult of that kind , I should think not worthy to be a gentleman 's wife : any more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it . Nay , now , , say she , thou carriest thy notion a great way . well , dear , say I , very seriously , for I could not help it , I be more full of fear than ever . I have only to beg of you , as one of the best friend I have in the world , to say nothing of my ask to stay . to say my master like I , when I know what end he aim at , be abomination to my ear ; and I sha not think myself safe till I be at my poor father 's and mother ' . she be a little angry with I , till I assure she that I have not the least uneasiness on she account , but think myself safe under she protection and friendship . and so we dropt the discourse for that time . I hope to have finish this ugly waistcoat in two day ; after which I have only some linen to get up , and shall then let you know how I contrive as to my passage ; for the heavy rain will make it sad travel on foot : but may be I may get a place to which be ten mile of the way , in farmer 's close cart ; for I can not sit a horse well at all , and may be nobody will be suffer to see I on upon the way . but I hope to let you know more . from , etc . my and , all my fellow - servant have now some notion that I be to go away ; but can not imagine for what . tell they , that my father and mother , grow in year , can not live without I ; and so I go home to they , to help to comfort they old age ; but they seem not to believe it . what they find it out by be ; the butler hear he say to I , as I pass by he , in the entry lead to the hall , who be that ? , , say I . ! say he , how long be you to stay here ?-- only , please you honour , say I , till I have do the waistcoat ; and it be almost finish . -- you might , say he , ( very roughly indeed , ) have finish that long enough ago , I should have think . indeed , and please you honour , say I , I have work early and late upon it ; there be a great deal of work in it .-- work in it ! say he ; you mind you pen more than you needle ; I do not want such idle slut to stay in my house . he seem start , when he see the butler , as he enter the hall , where stood . what do you here ? say he .-- the butler be as much confound as I ; for , never have be tax so roughly , I could not help cry sadly ; and get out of both they way to , and tell my complaint . this love , say she , be the ---- ! in how many strange shapes do it make people show themselves ! and in some the farthest from they heart . so one , and then another , have be since whispering , , , be we to lose ? as they always call I -- what have
have she do ? and she tell they , as above , about go home to you . she say afterwards to I , well , , you have make we master , from the sweetest temper gentleman in the world , one of the most peevish . but you have it in you power to make he as sweet - tempere as ever ; though I hope you will never do it on he term . this be very good in ; but it intimate , that she think as ill of he design as I ; and as she know he mind more than I , it convince I that I ought to get away as fast as I could . my master come in , just now , to speak to about household matter , have some company to dine with he to - morrow ; and I stand up , and have be cry at he roughness in the entry , I turn away my face . you may well , say he , turn away you curse face ; I wish I have never see it !-- , how long be she to be about this waistcoat ? , say I , if you honou have pleased , I would have take it with I ; and though it would be now finish in a few hour , I will do so still ; and remove this hate poor out of you house and sight for ever . , say he , not speak to I , I believe this little slut have the power of witchcraft , if ever there be a witch ; for she enchant all that come near she . she make even you , who should know better what the world be , think she a angel of light . I offer to go away ; for I believe he want I to ask to stay in my place , for all this he great wrath : and he say , stay here ! stay here , when I bid you ! and snatch my hand . I tremble , and say , I will ! I will ! for he hurt my finger , he grasp I so hard . he seem to have a mind to say something to I ; but break off abruptly , and say , ! and away I trip as fast as I could : and he and have a deal of talk , as she tell I ; and among the rest , he express himself vex to have speak in 's hearing . now you must know , that , we butler , be a very grave good sort of old man , with he hair as white as silver ! and a honest worthy man he be . I be hurry out with a flea in my ear , as the say be , and go down stairs into the parlour , meet he . he take hold of my hand ( in a gentler manner , though , than my master ) with both he ; and he say , ah ! sweet , sweet ! what be it I hear but just now !-- I be sorry at my heart ; but I be sure I will sooner believe any body in fault than you . thank you , , say I ; but as you value you place , do not be see speak to such a one as I . I cry too ; and slipt away as fast as I could from he , for he own sake , lest he should be see to pity I . and now I will give you a instance how much I be in 's esteem also . I have lose my pen some how ; and my paper be write out , I step to 's , we steward 's , office , to beg he to give I a pen or two , and a sheet or two of paper . he say , ay , that I will , my sweet maiden ! and give I three pens , some wafer , a stick of wax , and twelve sheet of paper ; and come from he desk , where he be write , he say , let I have a word or two with you , my sweet little mistress : ( for so these two good old gentleman often call I ; for I believe they love I dearly :) I hear bad news ; that we be go to lose you : I hope it be not true . yes it be , sir , say I ; but I be in hope it would not be know till I go away . what a --- l , say he , ail we master of late ! I never see such a alteration in any man in my life ! he be pleased with nobody as I see ; and by what tell I just now , he be quite out of the way with you . what could you have do to he , trog ? only be a very good woman , or I should have fear she have be you enemy . no , say I , nothing like it . be a just good woman ; and , next to my father and mother , the best friend I have in the world -- well , then , say he , it must be worse . shall I guess ? you be too pretty , my sweet mistress , and , may be , too virtuous . ah ! have I not hit it ? no , good , say I , do not think any thing amiss of my master ; he be cross and angry with I indeed , that be true ; but I may have
have give occasion for it , possibly ; and because I be desirous to go to my father and mother , rather than stay here , perhaps he may think I ungrateful . but , you know , sir , say I , that a father and mother 's comfort be the dearest thing to a good child that can be . sweet excellence ! say he , this become you ; but I know the world and mankind too well ; though I must hear , and see , and say nothing . and so a blessing attend my little sweeting , say he , wherever you go ! and away go I with a courtesy and thanks . now this pleasis one , my dear father and mother , to be so beloved . -- how much better , by good fame and integrity , be it to get every one 's good word but one , than , by pleasing that one , to make every one else one 's enemy , and be a execrable creature besides ! I be , etc . my and , we have a great many neighbouring gentleman , and they lady , this day , at dinner ; and my master make a fine entertainment for they : and , and , and , wait at table : and tell , that the lady will by and by come to see the house , and have the curiosity to see I ; for , it seem , they say to my master , when the joke fly about , well , ----, we understand you have a servant-maid , who be the greatest beauty in the county ; and we promise ourselves to see she before we go . the wench be well enough , say he ; but no such beauty as you talk of , I will assure ye . she be my mother 's wait - maid , who , on she death - bed , engage I to be kind to she . she be young , and every thing be pretty that be young . ay , ay , say one of the ladie , that be true ; but if you mother have not recommend she so strongly , there be so much merit in beauty , that I make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have want no inducement to be kind to it . they all laugh at my master : and he , it seem , laugh for company ; but say , I do not know how it be , but I see with different eye from other people ; for I have hear much more talk of she prettiness , than I think it deserve : she be well enough , as I say : but she greatest excellence be , that she be humble , and courteous , and faithful , and make all she fellow - servants love she : my housekeeper , in particular , doat upon she ; and you know , lady , she be a woman of discernment : and , as for , and , here , if they think themselves young enough , I be tell , they would fight for she . be it not true , ? Troth , sir , say he , can not please you honour , I never know she peer , and all you honour 's family be of the same mind . do you hear now ? say my master .-- well , say the lady , we will make a visit to by and by , and hope to see this paragon . I believe they be come ; and will tell you the rest by and by . I wish they have come , and be gone . why can not they make they game without I ? well , these fine lady have be here , and be go back again . I would have be absent , if I could , and do step into the closet : so they see I when they come in . there be four of they , at the great white house on the hill , , , and the other , it seem , a countess , of some hard name , I forget what . so , say one of the ladie , how do you do ? we be all come to inquire after you health . I be much oblige to you ladyship , say : will you ladyship please to sit down ? but , say the countess , we be not only come to ask after 's health neither ; but we be come to see a rarity beside . ah , say , I have not see you these two year , and they tell I she be grow wondrous pretty in that time . then I wish I have not be in the closet ; for when I come out , they must need know I hear they ; but I have often found , that bashful body owe themselves a spite , and frequently confound themselves more , by endeavouring to avoid confusion . why , yes , say , be very pretty indeed ; she be but in the closet there :-- Pamela , pray step hither . I come out all cover with blush , and they smile at one another . the countess take I by the hand : why , indeed , she be pleased to say , report have not be too lavish , I will assure you . do not be asham , child ; ( and star full in my face ;) I wish I have just such a face to be asham of . o how like a fool I look ! say , ay , my good Pamela , I say as she ladyship say
say : do not be so confused ; though , indeed , it become you too . I think you good lady depart make a sweet choice of such a pretty attendent . she would have be mighty proud of you , as she always be praise you , have she liv till now . ah ! madam , say , do you think that so dutiful a son as we neighbour , who always admire what he mother love , do not pride himself , for all what he say at table , in such a pretty maiden ? she look with such a malicious sneering countenance , I can not abide she . lady Towers say with a free air , ( for it seem she be call a wit , ) well , , I can not say I like you so well as these ladie do ; for I should never care , if you be my servant , to have you and you master in the same house together . then they all set up a great laugh . I know what i could have say , if I durst . but they be lady -- and lady may say any thing . say Lady Towers , can the pretty image speak , ? I vow she have speak eye ! of you little rogue , say she , and tap I on the cheek , you seem bear to undo , or to be undone ! , and please you ladyship , say I , it should be either !-- I beg , say I , to withdraw ; for the sense I have of my unworthiness render I unfin for such a presence . I then go away , with one of my best courtesy ; and say , as I go out , Prettily say , I vow !-- and say , see that shape ! I never see such a face and shape in my life ; why , she must be better descende than you have tell I ! and so they run on for half a hour more in my praise , as I be tell ; and glad be I , when I get out of the hearing of they . but , it seem , they go down with such a story to my master , and so full of I , that he have much ado to stand it ; but as it be very little to my reputation , I be sure I could take no pride in it ; and I fear it would make no better for I . this give I another cause for wish myself out of this house . this be morning , and next I hope to set out ; for I have finish my task , and my master be horrid cross ! and I be vex he crossness affect I so . if ever he have any kindness towards I , I believe he now hate I heartily . be it not strange , that love border so much upon hate ? but this wicked love be not like the true virtuous love , to be sure : that and hatred must be as far off , as light and darkness . and how must this hate have be increase , if he have meet with such a base compliance , after he wick will have be gratify . well , one may see by a little , what a great deal mean . for if innocence can not attract common civility , what must guil expect , when novetely have cease to have its charms , and changeableness have take place of it ? thus we read in , that wick , when he have ruin poor , hate she more than he ever love she , and would have turn she out of door . how happy am I , to be turn out of door , with that sweet companion my innocence !-- of may that be always my companion ! and while I presume not upon my own strength , and be willing to avoid the tempter , I hope the divine grace will assist I . forgive I , that I repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer . I owe every thing , next to 's goodness , to you piety and good example , my dear parent , my dear poor parent ! I say that word with pleasure ; for you poverty be my pride , as you integrity shall he my imitation . as soon as I have dine , I will put on my new clothes . I long to have they on . I know I shall surprise with they ; for she sha not see I till I be full dress .-- be come back , and I will soon send you some of what I have write .-- I find he be go early in the morning ; and so I will close here , that I be you most dutiful daughter . do not lose you time in meet I ; because I be so uncertain . it be hard if , some how or other , I can not get a passage to you . but may be my master will not refuse to let bring I . I can ride behind he , I believe , well enough ; for he be very careful , and very honest ; and you know as well as I ; for he love you both . besides , may be , Jervis can put I in some way . and , I shall write on , as long as I stay , though I should have nothing but silliness to write ; for I know you divert yourselves on night with what I write , because it be mine . tell I how
how much you long for my come ; but he say , he tell you he hope something would happen to hinder it . I be glad you do not tell he the occasion of my come away ; for if my fellow - servants should guess , it be better so , than to have it from you or I . besides , I really be concerned , that my master should cast away a thought upon such a poor creature as I ; for , besides the disgrace , it have quite turn he temper ; and I begin to believe what tell I , that he like I , and can not help it ; and yet strive to conquer it ; and so find no way but to be cross to I . do not think I presumptuous and conceit ; for it be more my concern than my pride , to see such a gentleman so demean himself , and lessen the regard he use to have in the eye of all he servants , on my account .-- but I be to tell you of my new dress to day . and so , when I have dine , up stair I go , and lock myself into my little room . there I trick myself up as well as I could in my new garb , and put on my round - eare ordinary cap ; but with a green knot , however , and my homespun gown and petticoat , and plain leather shoe ; but yet they be what they call spanish leather ; and my ordinary hose , ordinary I mean to what I have be lately use to ; though I shall think good yarn may do very well for every day , when I come home . a plain muslin tucker I put on , and my black silk necklace , instead of the french necklace my lady give I ; and put the ear- ring out of my ear ; and when I be quite equip , I take my straw hat in my hand , with its two blue string , and look about I in the glass , as proud as any thing -- to say truth , I never like myself so well in my life . of the pleasure of descend with ease , innocence , and resignation !-- indeed , there be nothing like it ! a humble mind , I plainly see , can not meet with any very shocking disappointment , let fortune 's wheel turn round as it will . so I go down to look for , to see how she like I . I meet , as I be upon the stair , we , who be the house - maid ; and she make I a low courtesy , and I find do not know I . so I smile , and go to the housekeeper 's parlour ; and there sit good at work , make a shift : and , would you believe it ? she do not know I at first ; but rise up , and pull off she spectacle ; and say , do you want I , forsooth ? I could not help laugh , and say , hey - day ! , what ! do not you know I ?-- she stand all in amaze , and look at I from top to toe : why , you surprise I , say she : what ! thus metamorphose ! how come this about ? as it happen , in steep my master ; and my back be to he , he think it be a stranger speak to , and withdraw again : and do not hear she ask , if he honou have any command for she ?-- she turn I about and about , and I shew she all my dress , to my under - petticoat : and she say , sit down , why , I be all in amaze , I must sit down . what can all this mean ? I tell she , I have no clothes suitable to my condition when I return to my father 's ; and so it be better to begin here , as I be soon to go away , that all my fellow - servants might see I know how to suit myself to the state I be return to . well , say she , I never know the like of thee . but this sad preparation for go away ( for now I see you be quite in earnest ) be what I know not how to get over . of my dear , how can I part with you ! my master ring in the back - parlour , and so I withdraw , and go to attend he . it seem , he say to she , I be come in to let you know , that I shall go to , and possibly to my sister Davers 's , and be absent some week . but , pray , what pretty neat damsel be with you ? she say , she smile , and ask , if he honou do not know who it be ? no , say he , I never see she before . , or , have neither of they such a tight prim lass for a daughter ! have they ?-- though I do not see she face neither , say he . if you honou will not be angry , say she , I will introduce she into you presence ; for I think , say she , she outdo we Pamela . now I do not thank she for this , as I tell she afterwards , ( for it bring a great deal of trouble upon I , as well as crossness ,
, as you shall hear ) . that can not be , he be pleased to say . but if you can find a excuse for it , let she come in . at that she steep to I , and tell I , I must go in with she to she master ; but , say she , for goodness ' sake , let he find you out ; for he do not know you . of fie , , say I , how could you serve I so ? besides , it look too free both in I , and to he . I tell you , say she , you shall come in ; and pray do not reveal yourself till he find you out . so I go in , foolish as I be ; though I must have be see by he another time , if I have not then . and she would make I take my straw hat in my hand . I dropt a low courtesy , but say never a word . I dare say he know I as soon as he see my face : but be as cunning as . he come up to I , and take I by the hand , and say , whose pretty maiden be you ?-- I dare say you be 's sister , you be so like she . so neat , so clean , so pretty ! why , child , you far surpass you sister ! I be all confusion , and would have speak : but he take I about the neck : why , say he , you be very pretty , child : I would not be so free with you sister , you may believe ; but I must kiss you . of sir , say I , I be , indeed I be : indeed I be , she own self ! he kiss I for all I could do ; and say , impossible ! you be a lovelier girl by half than ; and sure I may be innocently free with you , though I would not do she so much favour . this be a sad trick upon I , indeed , and what I could not expect ; and look like a fool as much as I , for she officiousness .-- at last I get away , and run out of the parlour , most sadly vex , as you may well think . he talk a good deal to , and at last order I to come in to he . come in , say he , you little villain !-- for so he call I . ( good sir ! what a name be there ! ) -- who be it you put you tricks upon ? I be resolve never to honour you unworthiness , say he , with so much notice again ; and so you must disguise yourself to attract I , and yet pretend , like a hypocrite as you be ---- I be out of patience then : hold , good sir , say I ; do not impute disguise and hypocrisy to I , above all thing ; for I hate they both , mean as I be . I have put on no disguise .-- what a plague , say he , for that be he word , do you mean then by this dress ?-- why , and please you honour , say I , I mean one of the honestest thing in the world . I have be in disguise , indeed , ever since my good lady you mother take I from my poor parent . I come to she ladyship so poor and mean , that these clothes I have on , be a princely suit to those I have then : and she goodness heape upon I rich clothes , and other bounty : and as I be now return to my poor parent again so soon , I can not wear those good thing without be hoote at ; and so have buy what will be more suitable to my degree , and be a good holiday - suit too , when I get home . he then take I in he arm , and presently push I from he . , say he , take the little witch from I ; I can neither bear , nor forbear she --( strange word these ! ) -- but stay ; you sha not go ! -- yet begone !-- no , come back again . I think he be mad , for my share ; for he know not what he would have . I be go , however ; but he steep after I , and take hold of my arm , and bring I in again : I be sure he make my arm black and blue ; for the mark be upon it still . , , say I , pray have mercy ; I will , I will come in ! he sit down , and look at I , and , as I think afterwards , as sillily as such a poor girl as I . at last he say , well , , as I be tell you , you may permit she to stay a little longer , till I see if my sister Davers will have she ; if , mean time , she humble herself , and ask this as a favour , and be sorry for she pertness , and the liberty she have take with my character out of the house , and in the house . you honour indeed tell I so , say : but I never find she inclinable to think herself in a fault . pride and perverseness , say he , with a vengeance ! yet this be you doating
doating -piece !-- well , for once , I will submit myself to tell you , hussy , say he to I , you may stay a fortnight longer , till I see my sister Daver : do you hear what I say to you , statue ? can you neither speak nor be thankful ? -- you honour fright I so , say I , that I can hardly speak : but I will venture to say , that I have only to beg , as a favour , that I may go to my father and mother .-- why fool , say he , will not you like to go to wait on my sister Davers ? , say I , I be once fond of that honour ; but you be pleased to say , I might be in danger from she ladyship 's nephew , or he from I .--d ----d impertinence ! say he ; do you hear , , do you hear , how she retort upon I ? be ever such matchless assurance !---- I then fall a weeping ; for say , , , fie !-- and I say , my lot be very hard indeed ; I be sure I would hurt nobody ; and I have be , it seem , guilty of indiscretion , which have cost I my place , and my master 's favour , and so have be turn she away : and when the time be come , that I should return to my poor parent , I be not suffer to go quietly . Gand you honour , what have I do , that I must be use worse than if I have rob you ? robb I ! say he , why so you have , hussy ; you have rob I . who ? I , sir ? say I ; have I rob you ? why then you be a justice of peace , and may send I to gaol , if you please , and bring I to a trial for my life ! if you can prove that I have rob you , I be sure I ought to die . now I be quite ignorant of he meaning ; though I do not like it , when it be afterwards explain , neither : and well , think I , what will this come to at last , if poor be esteem a thief ! then I think in a instant , how I should show my face to my honest poor parent , if I be but suspect . but , sir , say I , let I ask you but one question , and pray do not let I be call name for it ; for I do not mean disrespectfully : why , if I have do amiss , be I not leave to be dischar by you housekeeper , as the other maid have be ? and if , or , or , be to offend , would you honour stoop to take notice of they ? and why should you so demean yourself to take notice of I ? pray , sir , if I have not be worse than other , why should I suffer more than other ? and why should I not be turn away , and there be a end of it ? for indeed I be not of consequence enough for my master to concern himself , and be angry about such a creature as I . do you hear , , cry he again , how pertly I be interrogate by this saucy slut ? why , sauce - box , say he , do not my good mother desire I to take care of you ? and have you not be always distinguished by I , above a common servant ? and do you ingratitude upbraid I for this ? I say something mutteringly , and he vow he would hear it . I beg excuse ; but he insist upon it . why , then , say I , if you honour must know , I say , that my good lady do not desire you care to extend to the summer - house , and she dressing - room . well , this be a little saucy , you will say -- and he fly into such a passion , that I be force to run for it ; and say , it be happy I get out of the way . why what make he provoke one so , then ?-- I be almost sorry for it ; but I would be glad to get away at any rate . for I begin to be more fearful now . just now send I these line --( bless I ! what shall I do ? ) ' dear , take care of yourself ; for hear my master say to , who , she believe , be plead for you , say no more , ; for by g -- would I will have she ! burn this instantly . ' of pray for you poor daughter . I be call to go to be by , for it be past eleven ; and I be sure she shall hear of it ; for all this be owe to she , though she do not mean any harm . but I have be , and am , in a strange fluster ; and I suppose too , she will say , I have be full pert . of my dear father and mother , power and rich never want advocate ! but , poor gentlewoman , she can not live without he : and he have be very good to she . so good night . may be I shall send this in the morning ; but may be not ; so will not conclude
conclude : though I can not say too often , that I be ( though with great apprehension ) you most dutiful daughter . my , o let I take up my complaint , and say , never be poor creature so unhappy , and so barbarously use , as poor ! indeed , my dear father and mother , my heart 's just break ! I can neither write as I should do , nor let it alone , for to whom but you can I vent my grief , and keep my poor heart from bursting ! Wick , wick man !-- I have no patience when I think of he ! -- but yet , do not be frightened -- for -- I hope -- I hope , I be honest ! -- but if my head and my hand will let I , you shall hear all .-- be there no constable , nor headborough , though , to take I out of he house ? for I be sure I can safely swear the peace against he : but , alas ! he be greater than any constable : he be a justice himself : such a justice deliver I from ! -- but , I hope , in time , will right I -- for he know the innocence of my heart ! go you way in the morning ; but I have be too much distract to send by he ; and have see nobody but or , and one I hate to see or be see by and indeed I hate now to see any body . strange thing I have to tell you , that happen since last night , that good 's letter , and my master 's harshness , put I into such a fluster ; but I will not keep you in suspense . I go to 's chamber ; and , of dreadful ! my wicked master have hide himself , base gentleman as he be ! in she closet , where she have a few book , and chest of drawer , and such like . I little suspect it ; though I use , till this sad night , always to look into that closet and another in the room , and under the bed , ever since the summer - house trick ; but never find any thing ; and so I do not do it then , be fully resolve to be angry with for what have happene in the day , and so think of nothing else . I sit myself down on one side of the bed , and she on the other , and we begin to undress ourselves ; but she on that side next the wicked closet , that hold the worst heart in the world . so , say , you will not speak to I , ! I find you be angry with I . why , , say I , so I be , a little ; ' ti a folly to deny it . you see what I have suffer by you force I in to my master : and a gentlewoman of you year and experience must need know , that it be not fit for I to pretend to be any body else for my own sake , nor with regard to my master . but , say she , who would have think it would have turn out so ? ay , say I , little think who hear I , Lucifer always be ready to promote he own work and workman . you see presently what use he make of it , pretend not to know I , on purpose to be free with I . and when he take upon himself to know I , to quarrel with I , and use I hardly : and you too , say I , to cry , , fie , ! cut I to the heart : for that encourage he . do you think , my dear , say she , that I would encourage he ?-- I never say so to you before ; but , since you have force it from I , I must tell you , that , ever since you consult I , I have use my utmost endeavour to divert he from he wicked purpose : and he have promise fair ; but , to say all in a word , he doat upon you ; and I begin to see it be not in he power to help it . I luckily say nothing of the note from ; for I begin to suspect all the world almost : but I say , to try , well then , what would you have I do ? you see he be for have I wait on Lady Davers now . why , I will tell you freely , my dear , say she , and I trust to you discretion to conceal what I say : my master have be often desire I to put you upon ask he to let you stay ---- yes , say I , , let I interrupt you : I will tell you why I could not think of that : it be not the pride of my heart , but the pride of my honesty : for what must have be the case ? here my master have be very rude to I , once and twice ; and you say he can not help it , though he pretend to be sorry for it : well , he have give I warn to leave my place , and use I very harshly ; perhaps to frighten I to he purpose , as he suppose I would be fond of staying ( as indeed I should , if I could be safe ; for I love you and
and all the house , and value he , if he would act as my master ) . well then , as I know he design , and that he own he can not help it ; must I have ask to stay , know he would attempt I again ? for all you could assure I of , be , he would do nothing by force ; so I , a poor weak girl , be to be leave to my own strength ! and be not this to allow he to tempt I , as one may say ? and to encourage he to go on in he wicked device ?-- how then , , could I ask or wish to stay ? you say well , my dear child , say she ; and you have a justness of thought above you year ; and for all these consideration , and for what I have hear this day , after you run away , ( and I be glad you go as you do , ) I can not persuade you to stay ; and I shall be glad , ( which be what I never think I could have say , ) that you be well at you father 's ; for if will entertain you , she may as well have you from thence as here . there be my good ! say I ; will bless you for you good counsel to a poor maiden , that be hard beset . but pray what do he say , when I be go ? why , say she , he be very angry with you . but he would hear it ! say I : I think it be a little bold ; but then he provoke I to it . and have not my honesty be in the case , I would not by any means have be so saucy . besides , , consider it be the truth ; if he do not love to hear of the summer - house , and the dressing - room , why should he not be asham to continue in the same mind ? but , say she , when you have mutter this to yourself , you might have tell he any thing else . well , say I , I can not tell a wilful lie , and so there be a end of it . but I find you now give he up , and think there 's danger in stay . -- bless I ! I wish I be well out of the house ; so it be at the bottom of a wet ditch , on the wildest common in . why , say she , it signify nothing to tell you all he say but it be enough to make I fear you would not be so safe as I could wish ; and , upon my word , , I do not wonder he love you ; for , without flattery , you be a charming girl ! and I never see you look more lovely in you life than in that same new dress of yours . and then it be such a surprise upon we all !-- I believe truly , you owe some of you danger to the lovely appearance you make . then , say I , I wish the clothes in the fire : I expect no effect from they ; but , if any , a quite contrary one . Hush ! say I , , do you not hear something stir in the closet ? no , silly girl , say she , you fear be always awake .-- but indeed , say I , I think I hear something rustle .-- May be , say she , the cat may be get there : but I hear nothing . I be hush ; but she say , , my good girl , make haste to be . see if the door be fast . so I do , and be think to look into the closet ; but , hear no more noise , think it needless , and so go again and sit myself down on the bed - side , and go on undressing myself . and be by this time undress , step into bed , and bid I hasten , for she be sleepy . I do not know what be the matter , but my heart sadly misgave I : indeed , 's note be enough to make it do so , with what have say . I pull off my stay , and my stocking , and all my clothes to a under- petticoat ; and then hear a rustling again in the closet , I say , protect we ! but before I say my prayer , I must look into this closet . and so be go to it slip - shod , when , of dreadful ! out rush my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown . I scream , and run to the bed , and scream too ; and he say , I will do you no harm , if you forbear this noise ; but otherwise take what follow . instantly he come to the bed ( for I have crept into it , to , with my coat on , and my shoe ) ; and take I in he arm , say , , rise , and just step up stair to keep the maid from come down at this noise : I will do no harm to this rebel . o , for 's sake ! for pity 's sake ! , say I , if I be not betraye , do not leave I ; and , I beseech you , raise all the house . no , say , I will not
not stir , my dear lamb ; I will not leave you . I wonder at you , sy , say she ; and kindly throw herself upon my coat , clasp I round the waist : you shall not hurt this innocent , say she : for I will lose my life in she defence . be there not , say she , enough wick one in the world , for you base purpose , but you must attempt such a lamb as this ? he be desperate angry , and threaten to throw she out of the window ; and to turn she out of the house the next morning . you need not , sir , say she ; for I will not stay in it . God defend my poor Pamela till to - morrow , and we will both go together .-- say he , let I but expostulate a word or two with you , . , , say , do not hear a word , except he leave the bed , and go to the other end of the room . ay , out of the room , say I ; expostulate to - morrow , if you must expostulate ! I find he hand in my bosom ; and when my fright let I know it , I be ready to die ; and I sigh and scream , and faint away . and still he have he arm about my neck ; and be about my foot , and upon my coat . and all in a cold dewy sweat be I . ! ! say , as she tell I since , o -- h , and give another shriek , my poor Pamela be dead for certain ! and so , to be sure , I be for a time ; for I know nothing more of the matter , one fit follow another , till about three hour after , as it prove to be , I find myself in bed , and sit upon one side , with she wrapper about she , and on the other ; and no master , for the wicked wretch be gone . but I be so overjoyed , that I hardly could believe myself ; and I say , which be my first word , , , can I be sure it be you ? tell I ! can I ?-- where have I be ? Hush , my dear , say ; you have be in fit after fit . I never see any body so frightful in my life ! by this I judge know nothing of the matter ; and it seem my wicked master have , upon 's second noise on my fainting away , slipt out , and , as if he have come from he own chamber , disturb by the screaming , go up to the maid ' room , ( who , hear the noise , lay trembling , and afraid to stir , ) and bid they go down , and see what be the matter with and I . and he charge , and promise to forgive she for what she have say and do , if she would conceal the matter . so the maid come down , and all go up again , when I come to myself a little , except , who stay to sit up with I , and bear company . I believe they all guess the matter to be bad enough ; though they dare not say any thing . when I think of my danger , and the freedom he actually take , though I believe save I from worse , and she say she do , ( though what can I think , who be in a fit , and know nothing of the matter ? ) I be almost distrac . at first I be afraid of ; but I be fully satisfied she be very good , and I should have be lose but for she ; and she take on grievously about it . what would have become of I , have she go out of the room , to still the maid , as he bid she ! he would certainly have shut she out , and then , mercy on I ! what would have become of you poor ? I must leave off a little ; for my eye and my head be sadly bad .-- this be a dreadful trial ! this be the worst of all ! oh , that I be out of the power of this dreadfully wick man ! pray for you distressed daughter . my and , I do not rise till ten o'clock , and I have all the concern and wish of the family , and multitude of inquirie about I . my wick master go out early to hunt ; but leave word he would be in to breakfast . and so he be . he come up to we chamber about eleven , and have nothing to do to be sorry ; for he be we master , and so put on sharp anger at first . I have great emotion at he entering the room , and throw my apron over my head , and fall a crying , as if my heart would break . , say he , since I know you , and you I so well , I do not know how we shall live together for the future . , say she , I will take the liberty to say , what I think be best for both . I have so much grief , that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl , and especially in my chamber , that I should think myself accessary to the mischief , if I be not to take
take notice of it . though my ruin , therefore , may depend upon it , I desire not to stay ; but pray let poor and I go together . with all my heart , say he ; and the sooner the better . she fall a crying . I find , say he , this girl have make a party of the whole house in she favour against I . she innocence deserve it of we all , say she very kindly : and I never could have think that the son of my dear good lady depart , could have so forfeit he honour , as to endeaavor to destroy a virtue he ought to protect . no more of this , ! say he ; I will not hear it . as for , she have a lucky knack of falling into fits , when she pleasis . but the cursed yelling of you both make I not myself . I intend no harm to she , as I tell you both , if you would have leave you squalling : and I do no harm neither , but to myself ; for I raise a hornet 's nest about my ear , that , as far as I know , may have stung to death my reputation . , say , then I beg may take my account , and I will go away as soon as I can . as for , she be at she liberty , I hope , to go away next , as she intend ? I sit still ; for I could not speak nor look up , and he presence discompose I extremely ; but I be sorry to hear myself the unhappy occasion of 's lose she place , and hope that may be still make up . well , say he , let make up you account , as soon as you will ; and ( who be he housekeeper in ) shall come hither in you place , and will not be less obliging , I dare say , than you have be . say she , I have never disoblige you till now ; and let I tell you , sir , if you know what belong to you own reputation or honour -- no more , no more , say he , of these antiquate topic . I have be no bad friend to you ; and I shall always esteem you , though you have not be so faithful to my secret as I could have wish , and have lay I open to this girl , which have make she more afraid of I than she have occasion . well , sir , say she , after what pass yesterday , and last night , I think I go rather too far in favour of you injunction than otherwise ; and I should have deserve every body 's censure , as the basest of creature , have I be capable of contributing to you lawless attempt . , , still reflect upon I , and all for imaginary fault ! for what harm have I do the girl ?-- I will not bear it , I will assure you . but yet , in respect to my mother , I be willing to part friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom of you conversation , in relation to I ; which I should have resent more than I do , but that I be conscious I have no business to demean myself so as to be in you closet , where I might have expect to hear a multitude of impertinence between you . well , sir , say she , you have no objection , I hope , to 's go away on next ? you be mighty solicitous , say he , about : but no , not I ; let she go as soon as she will : she be a naughty girl , and have bring all this upon herself ; and upon I more trouble than she can have have from I : but I have overcome it all , and will never concern myself about she . I have a proposal make I , add he , since I have be out this morning , that I shall go near to embrace ; and so wish only , that a discreet use may be make of what be past ; and there be a end of every thing with I , as to , I will assure you . I clasp my hand together through my apron , overjoy at this , though I be soon to go away : for , naughty as he have be to I , I wish he prosperity with all my heart , for my good old lady 's sake . well , , say he , you need not now be afraid to speak to I ; tell I what you lift up you hand at ? I say not a word . say he , if you like what I have say , give I you hand upon it . I hold my hand up through my apron ; for I could not speak to he ; and he take hold of it , and press it , though less hard than he do my arm the day before . what do the little fool cover she face for ? say he : pull you apron away ; and let I see how you look , after you freedom of speech of I last night . no wonder you be asham to see I . you know you be very free with my character . I could not stand this barbarous insult , as I take it to be , consider he behaviour to I ; and I then speak and
and say , of the difference between the mind of thy creature , good ! how shall some be cast down in they innocence , while other can triumph in they guilt ! and so say , I go up stair to my chamber , and write all this ; for though he vex I at he taunting , yet I be pleased to hear he be likely to be married , and that he wicked intention be so happily overcome as to I ; and this make I a little easier . and I hope I have pass the worst ; or else it be very hard . and yet I sha not think myself at ease quite , till I be with you : for , methinks , after all , he repentance and amendment be mighty suddenly resolve upon . but the divine grace be not confin to space ; and remorse may , and I hope have , smite he to the heart at once , for he injury to poor I ! yet I will not be too secure neither . have opportunity , I send now what I know will grieve you to the heart . but I hope I shall bring my next scribble myself ; and so conclude , though half break - heart , you ever dutiful Daughter . and , I be glad I desire you not to meet I , and say you will not ; for he tell you he be sure I shall get a passage well enough , either behind some one of my fellow - servants on horseback , or by farmer 's means : but as to the chariot he talk to you of , I can not expect that favour , to be sure ; and I should not care for it , because it would look so much above I . but farmer , they say , have a chaise with one horse , and we hope to borrow that , or hire it , rather than fail ; though money run a little lowish , after what I have lay out ; but I do not care to say so here ; though I warrant I might have what I would of , or , or ; but then how shall I pay it ? you will say : and , beside , I do not love to be beholden . but the chief reason I be glad you do not set out to meet I , be the uncertainty ; for it seem I must stay another week still , and hope certainly to go after . for poor will go at the same time , she say , and can not be ready before . oh ! that I be once well with you !-- though he be very civil too at present , and not so cross as he be : and yet he be as vexatious another way , as you shall hear . for yesterday he have a rich suit of clothes bring home , which they call a birth - day suit ; for he intend to go to against next birth - day , to see the court ; and we folk will have it he be to be make a lord .-- I wish they may make he a honest man , as he be always think ; but I have not find it so , alas for I ! and so , as I be say , he have these clothes come home , and he try they on . and before he pull they off , he send for I , when nobody else be in the parlour with he : , say he , you be so neat and so nice in you own dress , ( - a - day , I do not know I be ! ) that you must be a judge of ours . how be these clothes make ? do they fit I ?-- I be no judge , say I , and please you honour ; but I think they look very fine . he waistcoat stand on end with silver lace , and he look very grand . but what he do last , have make I very serious , and I could make he no compliment . say he , why do not you wear you usual clothes ? though I think every thing look well upon you ( for I still continue in my new dress ) . I say , I have no clothes , sir , I ought to call my own , but these : and it be no matter what such a one as I wear . say he , why you look very serious , . I see you can bear malice . -- yes , so I can , sir , say I , accord to the occasion ! why , say he , you eye always look red , I think . be you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to heart ? I be sure you , and that fool , frightene I , by you hideous squalling , as much as I could frighten you . that be all we have for it , say I ; and if you could be so afraid of you own servants know of you attempt upon a poor unworthy creature , that be under you protection while I stay , surely you honour ought to be more afraid of , in whose presence we all stand , in every action of we life , and to whom the greatest , as well as the least , must be accountable , let they think what they list . he take my hand , in a kind of good - humoured mockery , and say , well urge , my pretty preacher !
! when my chaplain die , I will put thee on a gown and cassock , and thou 'lt make a good figure in he place . -- I wish , say I , a little vex at he jeer , you honour 's conscience would be you preacher , and then you would need no other chaplain . well , well , , say he , no more of this unfashionable jargon . I do not send for you so much for you opinion of my new suit , as to tell you , you be welcome to stay , since desire it , till she go . I welcome ! say I ; I be sure I shall rejoice when I be out of the house ! well , say he , you be a ungrateful baggage ; but I be think it would be pity , with these fair soft hand , and that lovely skin , ( as he call it , and take hold of my hand , ) that you should return again to hard work , as you must if you go to you father 's ; and so I would advise she to take a house in , and let lodging to we member of parliament , when we come to town ; and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for , will always fill she house , and she will get a great deal of money . I be sadly vex at this barbarous joke ; but be ready to cry before , the tear gush out , and ( endeavour to get my hand from he , but in vain ) I say , I can expect no better : you behaviour , sir , to I , have be just of a piece with these word : Nay , I will say it , though you be to be ever so angry .-- I angry , ? no , no , say he , I have overcome all that ; and as you be to go away , I look upon you now as 's guest while you both stay , and not as my servant ; and so you may say what you will . but I will tell you , , why you need not take this matter in such high disdain ! -- you have a very pretty romantic turn for virtue , and all that . -- and I do not suppose but you will hold it still : and nobody will be able to prevail upon you . but , my child , ( sneeringly he speak it , ) do but consider what a fine opportunity you will then have for a tale every day to good mother , and what subject for letter - write to you father and mother , and what pretty preachment you may hold forth to the young gentleman . be my heart ! I think it would be the best thing you and she could do . you do well , sir , say I , to even you wit to such a poor maiden as I : but , permit I to say , that if you be not rich and great , and I poor and little , you would not insult I thus .-- let I ask you , sir , if you think this become you fine clothes , and a master 's station : why so serious , my ? say he : why so grave ? and would kiss I ; but my heart be full , and I say , let I alone ; I will tell you , if you be a king , and insult I as you have do , that you have forget to act like a gentleman ; and I will not stay to be use thus : I will go to the next farmer 's , and there wait for , if she must go : and I would have you know , sir , that I can stoop to the ordinariest work of you scullion , for all these nasty soft hand , sooner than bear such ungentlemanly imputation . I send for you , say he , in high good humour ; but it be impossible to hold it with such a impertinent : however , I will keep my temper . but while I see you here , pray do not put on those dismal grave look : why , girl , you should forbear they , if it be but for you pride - sake ; for the family will think you be grieve to leave the house . then , sir , say I , I will try to convince they of the contrary , as well as you honour ; for I will endeaavor to be more cheerful while I stay , for that very reason . well , reply he , I will set this down by itself , as the first time that ever what I have advise have any weight with you . and I will add , say I , as the first advice you have give I of late , that be fit to be follow .-- I wish say he , ( I be almost asham to write it , impudent gentleman as he be ! ) I wish I have thee as quick another way , as thou be in thy repartee -- and he laugh , and I snatch my hand from he , and I tripp away as fast as I could . ah ! think I , marry ? I be sure it be time you be marry , or , at this rate , no honest maiden ought to live with you . why , dear father and mother , to be sure he grow quite a rake ! how easy it be to go from
from bad to worse , when once people give way to vice ! how would my poor lady , have she liv , have grieve to see it ! but may be he would have be better then ! though it seem he tell , he have a eye upon I in he mother 's life - time ; and he intend to let I know as much , by the bye , he tell she ! here be shamelessness for you ! sure the world must be near at a end ! for all the gentleman about be as bad as he almost , as far as I can hear !-- and see the fruit of such bad example ! there be ' in the grove , have have three lyings - in , it seem , in he house , in three month past ; one by himself ; and one by he coachman ; and one by he woodman ; and yet he have turn none of they away . indeed , how can he , when they but follow he own vile example ? there be he , and two or three more such as he , within ten mile of we , who keep company , and hunt with we fine master , truly ; and I suppose he be never the better for they example . but , bless I , say I , and send I out of this wicked house ! but , dear father and mother , what sort of creature must the womenkind be , do you think , to give way to such wickedness ? why , this it be that make every one be think of alike : and , alack - a - day ! what a world we live in ! for it be grow more a wonder that the man be resist , than that the woman comply . this , I suppose , make I such a sauce - box , and bold - face , and a creature , and all because I will not be a sauce - box and bold - face indeed . but I be sorry for these thing ; one do not know what art and stratagem man may devise to gain they vile end ; and so I will think as well as I can of these poor undone creature , and pity they . for you see , by my sad story , and narrow escape , what hardship poor maiden go through , whose let it be to go out to service , especially to house where there be not the fear of , and good rule keep by the head of the family . you see I be quite grow grave and serious ; indeed it become the present condition of you dutiful daughter . and , say you weep when you read my last letter , that he carry . I be sorry you let he see that ; for they all mistrust already how matter be , and as it be no credit that I have be attempt , though it be that I have resist ; yet I be sorry they have cause to think so evil of my master from any of we . have make up she account with , and will stay in she place . I be glad of it , for she own sake , and for my master 's ; for she have a good master of he ; so indeed all have , but poor I -- and he have a good housekeeper in she . , it seem , take upon he to talk to my master , how faithful and careful of he interest she be , and how exact in she account ; and he tell he , there be no comparison between she account and 's , at the estate . he say so many fine thing , it seem , of , that my master send for she in 's presence , and say might come along with she ; I suppose to mortify I , that I must go while she be to stay : but as , when I go away , I be not to go with she , nor be she to go with I ; so I do not matter it much ; only it would have be creditable to such a poor girl , that the housekeeper would bear I company , if I go . say he to she , well , , say you have make up you account with he with you usual fidelity and exactness . I have a good mind to make you a offer of continue with I , if you can be a little sorry for you hasty word , which , indeed , be not so respectful as I have deserve at you hand . she seem at a sad loss what to say , because be there , and she could not speak of the occasion of those word , which be I . indeed , say , I must need say before you face , that since I have know my master 's family , I have never find such good management in it , nor so much love and harmony neither . I wish the estate be as well serve !-- no more of that , say my master ; but may stay , if she will : and here , , pray accept of this , which at the close of every year 's account I will present you with , besides you salary , as long as I find you care so useful and agreeable . and he give she five guinea .-- she make he a low courtesy , and thanke he , look to I , as if she would have speak to I . he take she mean
mean , I believe ; for he say ,-- indeed I love to encourage merit and obligingness , ; but I can never be equally kind to those who do not deserve it at my hand , as to those who do ; and then he look full on I . , continue he , I say that girl might come in with , because they love to be always together . for be very good to she , and love she as well as if she be she daughter . but else -- , interrupt he , say , to ! ay , sir , and so she be , to be sure ! but every body must be good to she ; for ---- he be go on : but my master say , no more , no more , . I see old man be take with pretty young girl , as well as other folk ; and fair look hide many a fault , where a person have the art to behave obligingly . why , and please you honour , say , every body -- and be go on , I believe , to say something more in my praise , but he interrupt he , and say , not a word more of this Pamela . I can not let she stay , I will assure you ; not only for she own freedom of speech , but she letter -writing of all the secret of my family . ay , say the good old man , I be sorry for that too ! but , sir ,-- no more , I say , say my master ; for my reputation be so well know , ( mighty fine , think I ! ) that I care not what any body write or say of I : but to tell you the truth , ( not that it need go further , ) I think of change my condition soon ; and , you know , young lady of birth and fortune will choose they own servants , and that be my chief reason why can not stay . as for the rest , say he , the girl be a good sort of body , take she altogether ; though I must need say , a little pert , since my mother 's death , in she answer , and give I two word for one ; which I can not bear ; nor be there reason I should , you know , . no , to be sure , sir , say he : but ' ttis strange , methinks , she should be so mild and meek to every one of we in the house , and forget herself so , where she should show most respect ! very true , , say he , but so it be , I will assure you ; and it be from she pertness , that and I have the word : and I should mind it the less , but that the girl ( there she stand , I say it to she face ) have wit and sense above she year , and know better . I be in great pain to say something , but yet I know not what , before ; and look at I , and walk to the window to hide she concern for I . at last , I say , it be for you , sir , to say what you please ; and for I only to say , bless you honour ! poor falter in he speech , and be ready to cry . say my insulting master to I , why , pr'ythee , , now , show thyself as thou art , before . can 'st not give he a specimen of that pertness which thou hast exercise upon I sometimes ? do he not , my dear father and mother , deserve all the truth to be tell ? yet I overcame myself so far , as to say , well , you honour may play upon a poor girl , that you know call answer you , but dare not . why , pr'ythee now , insinuator , say he , say the worst you can before and . I challenge the utmost of thy impertinence : and as you be go away , and have the love of every body , I would be a little justified to my family , that you have no reason to complain of hardship from I , as I have pert saucy answer from you , besides expose I by you letter . surely , sir , say I , I be of no consequence equal to this , in you honour 's family , that such a great gentleman as you , should need to justify yourself about I . I be glad stay with you honour ; and I know I have not deserve to stay : and , more than that , I do not desire to stay . ads - bobber ! say , and run to I ; do not say so , do not say so , dear ! we all love you dearly : and pray down of you knee , and ask he honour pardon , and we will all become pleader in a body , and I , and too , at the head of it , to beg he honour 's pardon , and to continue you , at least , till he honour marry .-- no , , say I , I can not ask ; nor will I stay , if I might . all I desire be , to return to my poor father and mother : and though I love you all , I will not stay .-- of well - a - day , well - a -
- day ! say the good old man , I do not expect this !-- when I have get matter thus far , and have make all up for , I be in hope to have get a double holiday of joy for all the family , in you pardon too . well , say my master , this be a little specimen of what I tell you , . you see there be a spirit you do not expect . tell I after , that she could stay no longer , to hear I so hardly use ; and must have speak , have she stay , what would never have be forgive she ; so she go out . I look after she to go too ; but my master say , , , give another specimen , I desire you , to Longman I be sure you must , if you will but speak . well , sir , say I , since it seem you greatness want to be justifi by my lowness , and I have no desire you should suffer in the sight of you family , I will say , on my bended knee , ( and so I knee down , ) that I have be a very faulty , and a very ungrateful creature to the best of master : I have be very perverse and saucy ; and have deserve nothing at you hand but to be turn out of you family with shame and disgrace . I , therefore , have nothing to say for myself , but that I be not worthy to stay , and so can not wish to stay , and will not stay : and so bless you , and you , and good , and every liive soul of the family ! and I will pray for you as long as I live !-- and so I rise up , and be force to lean upon my master 's elbow - chair , or I should have sink down . the poor old man weep more than I , and say , -bobber , be ever the like heard ! ' tTis too much , too much ; I can not bear it . as I hope to live , I be quite melte . dear sir , forgive she ! the poor thing pray for you ; she pray for we all ! she own she fault ; yet will not be forgive ! I profess I know not what to make of it . my master himself , harden wretch as he be , see a little moved , and take he handkerchief out of he pocket , and walk to the window : what sort of a day be it ? say he .-- and then , get a little more hard - heartedness , he say , well , you may be go from my presence , thou strange medley of inconsistence ! but you sha not stay after you time in the house . Nay , pray , sir , pray , sir , say the good old man , relent a little . ads - heartikin ! you young gentleman be make of iron and steel , I think ; I be sure , say he , my heart 's turn into butter , and be run away at my eye . I never feel the like before . -- say my master , with a imperious tone , get out of my presence , hussy ! I can not bear you in my sight . , say I , I be go as fast as I can . but , indeed , my dear father and mother , my head be so giddy , and my limb tremble so , that I be force to go hold by the wainscot all the way with both my hand , and think I should not have get to the door : but when I do , as I hope this would be my last interview with this terrible hard - hear master , I turn about , and make a low courtesy , and say , bless you , sir ! bless you , ! and I go into the lobby lead to the great hall , and dropt into the first chair ; for I could get no farther a good while . I leave all these thing to you reflection , my dear parent but I can write no more . my poor heart 's almost broken ! indeed it be -- of when shall I get away ! -- send I , good , in safety , once more to my poor father 's peaceful cot !-- and there the worst that can happen will be joy in perfection to what I now bear !-- of pity you distress daughter . my and , I must write on , though I shall come so soon ; for now I have hardly any thing else to do . I have finish all that lay upon I , and only wait the good time of set out . say , I must be low in pocket , for what I have lay out ; and so would have present I with two guinea of she five ; but I could not take they of she , because , poor gentlewoman , she pay old debt for she child , that be extravagant , and want they herself . this , though , be very good in she . I be sorry I shall have but little to bring with I ; but I know you will not , you be so good !-- and I will work the harder , when I come home , if I can get a little plain - work , or any thing , to do . but all you neighbourhood be so
so poor , that I fear I shall want work , except , may be , dame can help I to something , from any good family she be acquaint with . here , what a sad thing it be ! I have be bring up wrong , as matter stand . for , you know , my good lady , now in heaven , love singing and dancing ; and , as she would have it , I have a voice , she make I learn both ; and often and often have she make I s she a innocent song , and a good psalm too , and dance before she . and I must learn to flower and draw too , and to work fine work with my needle ; why , all this too I have get pretty tolerably at my finger 's end , as they say ; and she use to praise I , and be a good judge of such matters . well now , what be all this to the purpose , as thing have turn about ? why , no more nor less , than that I be like the grasshopper in the fable , which I have read of in my lady 's book , as follow :--[ see the Aesop 's Fable which have lately be select and reform from those of . , and the most eminent mythologist . ] 'as the ants be aire they provision one winter , a hungry grasshopper ( as suppose it be poor I ) beg a charity of they . they tell he , that he should have wrotch in summer , if he would not have want in winter . well , say the grasshopper , but I be not idle neither ; for I sung out the whole season . Nay , then , say they , you will e'en do well to make a merry year of it , and dance in winter to the time you sung in summer . ' so I shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing , when I come home to you ! Nay , I shall be unfit even for a - day holiday - time ; for these minuet , rigadoon , and french dance , that I have be practise , will make I but ill company for my milk -maid companion that be to be . to be sure I have better , as thing stand , have learn to wash and scour , and brew and bake , and such like . put I hope , if I can not get work , and can meet with a place , to learn these soon , if any body will have the goodness to bear with I till I be able : for , notwithstand what my master say , I hope I have a humble and teachable mind ; and , next to 's , that be all my comfort : for I shall think nothing too mean that be honest . it may be a little hard at first ; but woe to my proud heart , if I find it so on trial ; for I will make it bend to its condition , or break it . I have read of a good bishop that be to be burnt for he religion ; and he try how he could bear it , by put he finger into the lighted candle : so I , t'other day , try , when 's back be turn , if I could not scour a pewter plate she have begin . I see I could would o't by degree : it only blister my hand in two place . all the matter be , if I could get plain - work enough , I need not spoil my finger . but if I can not , I hope to make my hand as red as a blood - pudding , and as hard as a beechen trencher , to accommodate they to my condition . -- but I must break off ; here be somebody come . ' Tis only we with a message from .-- but , hold , here be somebody else . well , it be only . I be as much frighted , as be the city mouse and the country mouse , in the same book of fable , at every thing that stir . o ! I have a power of these thing to entertain you with in winter evening , when I come home . if I can but get work , with a little time for reading , I hope we shall be very happy over we peat fire . what make I hint to you , that I should bring but little with I , be this : you must know , I do intend to do , as I have this afternoon : and that be , I take all my clothes , and all my linen , and I divide they into three parcel , as I have before tell I intend to do ; and I say , it be now , , and I be to go away on morning betimes ; so , though I know you do not doubt my honesty , I beg you will look over my poor matters , and let every one have what belong to they ; for , say I , you know I be resolve to take with I only what I can properly call my own . say she , ( I do not know she drift then ; to be sure she mean well ; but I do not thank she for it , when I do know it , ) let you thing be bring down in the green - room , and I will do any thing you will
will have I do . with all my heart , say I , green - room or any where ; but I think you might step up , and see th'ey as they lie . however , I fetch th'ey down , and lay they in three parcel , as before ; and , when I have do , I go down to call she up to look at they . now , it seem , she have prepare my master for this scene , unknown to I ; and in this green - room be a closet , with a sash - door , and a curtain before it ; for there she put she sweet - meat and such thing ; and she do it , it seem , to turn he heart , as know what I intend , I suppose that he should make I take the thing ; for , if he have , I should have make money of they , to help we when we get together ; for , to be sure , I could never have appear in they . well , as I be say , he have get , unknown to I , into this closet ; I suppose while I go to call : and she since own to I , it be at he desire , when she tell he something of what I intend , or else she would not have do it : though I have reason , I be sure , to remember the last closet - work . so I say , when she come up , here , , be the first parcel ; I will spread it all abroad . these be the thing my good lady give I .-- in the first place , say I -- and so I go on describe the clothes and line my lady have give I , mingling blessing , as I proceed , for she goodness to I ; and when I have turn over that parcel , I say , well , so much for the first parcel , ; that be my lady 's gift . now I come to the present of my dear virtuous master : hey , you know closet for that ! . she laugh , and say , I never see such a comical girl in my life ! but go on . I will , , say I , as soon as I have open the bundle ; for I be as brisk and as pert as could be , little thinking who hear I . now here , , say I , be my ever worthy master 's present ; and then I particularise all those in the second bundle . after which , I turn to my own , and say , now , , come poor 's bundle ; and a little one it be to the other . first , here be a calico nightgown , that I use to wear of ' morning . 'Twill be rather too good for I when I get home ; but I must have something . then there be a quilted calamanco coat , and a pair of stocking I buy of the pedlar , and my straw - hat with blue string ; and a remnant of cloth , which will make two shirt and two shift , the same I have on , for my poor father and mother . and here be four other shifts , one the fellow to that I have on ; another pretty good one , and the other two old fine one , that will serve I to turn and wind with at home , for they be not worth leave behind I ; and here be two pair of shoe , I have take the lace off , which I will burn , and may be will fetch I some little matter at a pinch , with a old silver buckle or two . what do you laugh for , ? say I .-- why you be like a day ; you cry and laugh in a breath . well , let I see ; ay , here be a cotton handkerchief I buy of the pedlar -- there should be another somewhere . o , here it be ! and here too be my new - buy knit mitten ; and this be my new flannel coat , the fellow to that I have on and in this parcel , pin together , be several piece of print calico , remnant of silk , and such like , that , if good luck should happen , and I should get work , would serve for robin and facing , and such like use . and here too be a pair of pockets : they be too fine for I ; but I have no worse . bless I , say I , I do not think I have so many good thing ! well , , say I , you have see all my store , and I will now sit down , and tell you a piece of my mind . be brief then , say she , my good girl : for she be afraid , she say afterwards , that I should say too much . why than the case be this : I be to enter upon a point of equity and conscience , ; and I must beg , if you love I , you would let I have my own way . those thing there of my lady 's , I can have no claim to , so as to take they away ; for she give they I , suppose I be to wear they in she service , and to do credit to she bountiful heart . but , since I be to be turn away ,
, you know , I can not wear they at my poor father 's ; for I should bring all the little village upon my back ; and so I resolve not to have they . then , , say I , I have far less right to these of my worthy master 's ; for you see what be he intention in give they to I . so they be to be the price of my shame , and if I could make use of they , I should think I should never prosper with they ; and , besides , you know , , if I would not do the good gentleman 's work , why should I take he wage ? so , in conscience , in honour , in every thing , I have nothing to say to thee , thou second wick bundle ! but , say I , cone to my arm , my dear third parcel , the companion of my poverty , and the witness of my honesty ; and may I never deserve the least rag that be contain in thee , when I forfeit a title to that innocence , that I hope will ever be the pride of my life ! and then I be sure it will be my highest comfort at my death , when all the rich and pomp of the world will be worse than the vilest rag that can be wear by beggar ! and so I hugge my third bundle . but , say I , , ( and she weep to hear I , ) one thing more I have to trouble you with , and that be all . there be four guinea , you know , that come out of my good lady 's pocket , when she die ; that , with some silver , my master give I : now these same four guinea I send to my poor father and mother , and they have break they ; but would make they up , if I would : and if you think it should be so , it shall . but pray tell I honestly you mind : as to the three year before my lady 's death , do you think , as I have no wage , I may be suppose to be quit ?-- by quit , I can not mean that my poor service should be equal to my lady 's goodness ; for that be impossible . but as all she learning and education of I , as matter have turn , will be of little service to I now ; for it have be better for I to have be bring up to hard labour , to be sure ; for that I must turn to at last , if I can not get a place : ( and you know , in place too , one be subject to such temptation as be dreadful to think of :) so , I say , by quit I only mean , as I return all the good thing she give I , whether I may not set my little service against my keeping ; because , as I say , my learning be not now in the question ; and I be sure my dear good lady would have think so , have she liv ; but that too be now out of the question . well then , if so , I would ask , , in above this year that I have live with my master , as I be resolve to leave all he gift behind I , I may not have earn , besides my keeping , these four guinea , and these poor clothes here upon my back , and in my third bundle ? now tell I you mind freely , without favour or affection . ! my dear girl , say she , you make I unable to speak to you at all : to be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offer , for you to leave any of these thing behind you ; and you must take all you bundle with you , or my master will never forgive you . well , well , , say I , I do not care ; I have be too much use to be snub and hardly treat by my master , of late . I have do he no harm ; and I shall always pray for he and wish he happy . but I do not deserve these thing ; I know I do not . then , I can not wear they , if I should take they ; so they can be of no use to I : and I trust I shall not want the poor pittance , that be all I desire to keep life and soul together . bread and water I can live upon , , with content . Water I shall get any where ; and if I can not get I bread , I will live like a bird in winter upon hip and haw , and at other time upon pig - nut and potatoe , or turnip , or any thing . so what occasion have I for these thing ? -- but all I ask be about these four guinea , and if you think I need not return they , that be all I want to know .-- to be sure , my dear , you need not , say she ; you have well earn they by that waistcoat only . no , I think not so , in that only ; but in the linen , and other thing , do you think I have ? yes , yes , say she , and more . and my keeping allow for , I mean , say
say I , and these poor clothes on my back , besides ? remember that , . yes , my dear odd - one , no doubt you have . well then , say I , I be as happy as a princess . I be quite as rich as I wish to be : and once more , my dear third bundle , I will hug thee to my bosom . and I beg you will say nothing of all this till I be go , that my master may not be so angry , but that I may go in peace ; for my heart , without other matter , will he ready to break to part with you all . now , , say I , as to one matter more : and that be my master 's last usage of I , before . -- she , , dear , step to my chamber , and fetch I a paper I leave on my table . I have something to show you in it . I will , say I , and step down ; but that be only a fetch , to take the order of my master , I find . it seem he say , he think two or three time to have burst out upon I ; but he could not stand it , and wish I might not know he be there . but I trip up again so nimbly , ( for there be no paper , ) that I just see he back , as if come out of that green - room , and go into the next to it , the first door that be open -- I whip in , and shut the door , and bolt it . of ! say I , what have you do by I ?-- I see I can not confide in any body . I be beset on all hand . Wretch , wretch , where shalt thou expect a friend , if join to betray thee thus ? she make so many protestation , ( tell I all , and that he own I have make he wipe he eye two or three time , and say she hope it would have a good effect , and remember I , that I have say nothing but what would rather move compassion than resentment , ) that I forgave she . but o ! that I be safe from this house ! for never poor creature sure be so flustered as I have be so many month together ;-- I be call down from this most tedious scribble . I wonder what will next befall you dutiful daughter . say , she be sure I shall have the chariot to carry I home to you . though this will look too great for I , yet it will show as if I be not turn away quite in disgrace . the travelling chariot be come from , and I fancy I shall go in that ; for the other be quite grand . MY and , I write again , though , may be , I shall bring it to you in my pocket : for I shall have no writing , nor writing - time , I hope , when I come to you . this be morning , and I shall , I hope , set out to you to - morrow morning ; but I have have more trials and more vexation ; but of another complexion too a little , though all from the same quarter . yesterday my master , after he come from hunting , send for I . I go with great terror : for I expect he would storm , and be in a fine passion with I for my freedom of speech before : so I be resolve to begin first , with submission , to disarm he anger ; and I fall upon my knee as soon as I see he ; and say , good sir , let I beseech you , as you hope to be forgive yourself , and for the sake of my dear good lady you mother , who recommend I to you with she last word , to forgive I all my fault ; and only grant I this favour , the last I shall ask you , that you will let I depart you house with peace and quietness of mind , that I may take such a leave of my dear fellow - servants as befit I ; and that my heart be not quite break . he take I up , in a kinder manner than ever I have know ; and he say , shut the door , , and come to I in my closet : I want to have a little serious talk with you . how can I , sir , say I , how can I ! and wring my hand . of pray , sir , let I go out of you presence , I beseech you ! by the that make I , say he , I will do you no harm . shut the parlour door , and come to I in my library . he then go into he closet , which be he library , and full of rich picture besides ; a noble apartment , though call a closet , and next the private garden , into which it have a door that open . I shut the parlour door , as he bid I ; but stand at it irresolute . place some confidence in I , say he : surely you may , when I have speak thus solemnly . so I crept towards he with trembling foot , and my heart throbb through my handkerchief . come in , say he , when I bid you .
. I do so . pray , sir , say I , pity and spare I . I will , say he , as I hope to be save . he sit down upon a rich settee ; and take hold of my hand , and say , do not doubt I , . from this moment I will no more consider you as my servant : and I desire you will not use I with ingratitude for the kindness I be go to express towards you . this a little embolden I ; and he say , hold both my hand between he , you have too much wit and good sense not to discover , that I , in spite of my heart , and all the pride of it , can not but love you . yes , look up to I , my sweet - faced girl ! I must say I love you ; and have put on a behaviour to you , that be much against my heart , in hope to frighten you from you reservedness . you see I own it ingenuously ; and do not play you sex upon I for it . I be unable to speak ; and he , see I too much oppress with confusion to go on in that strain , say , well , , let I know in what situation of life be you father : I know he be a poor man ; but be he as low and as honest as he be when my mother take you ? then I could speak a little ; and with a down look , ( and I feel my face glow like fire , ) I say , yes , sir , as poor and as honest too ; and that be my pride . say he , I will do something for he , if it be not you fault , and make all you family happy . all , sir , say I , he be happier already than ever he can be , if he daughter 's innocence be to be the price of you favour : and I beg you will not speak to I on the only side that can wound I . I have no design of that sort , say he . of sir , say I , tell I not so , tell I not so !--'Tis easy , say he , for I to be the making of you father , without injure you . well , sir , say I , if this can be do , let I know how ; and all I can do with innocence shall be the study and practice of my life .-- but , o ! what can such a poor creature as I do , and do my duty ? -- he , I would have you stay a week or fortnight only , and behave yourself with kindness to I ; I stoop to beg it of you , and you shall see all shall turn out beyond you expectation . I see , say he , you be go to answer otherwise than I would have you ; and I begin to be vex I should thus meanly sue ; and so I will say , that you behaviour before honest , when I use you as I do , and you could so well have vindicate yourself , have quite charme I . and though I be not please with all you say yesterday , while I be in the closet , yet you have move I more to admire you than before ; and I be awaken to see more worthiness in you , than ever I see in any lady in the world . all the servant , from the highest to the lowest , doat upon you , instead of envy you ; and look upon you in so superior a light , as speak what you ought to be . I have see more of you letter than you imagine , ( this surprise I ! ) and be quite overcome with you charming manner of writing , so free , so easy , and many of you sentiment so much above you year , and you sex ; and all put together , make I , as I tell you , love you to extravagance . now , , when I have stoop to acknowledge all this , oblige I only to stay another week or fortnight , to give I time to bring about some certain affair , and you shall see how much you may find you account in it . I tremble to find my poor heart give way .-- of good sir , say I , spare a poor girl that can not look up to you , and speak . my heart be full ; and why should you wish to undo I ?-- only oblige I , say he , to stay a fortnight longer , and shall carry word to you father , that I will see he in the time , either here , or at the in he village . of sir , say I , my heart will burst ; but , on my bended knee , I beg you to let I go to - morrow , as I design : and do not offer to tempt a poor creature , whose whole will would be to do yours , if my virtue would permit !-- I shall permit it , say he ; for I intend no injury to you , be my witness ! impossible ! say I ; I cannot , sir , believe you , after what have pass : how many way be there to undue poor creature ! , protect I this one time , and send I but to my dear
dear father 's cot in safety !-- , ----d fate ! say he , that when I speak so solemnly , I can not be believe !-- what should I believe , sy ? say I , what can I believe ? what have you say , but that I be to stay a fortnight longer ? and what then be to become of I ?-- my pride of birth and fortune ( d -- and they both ! say he , since they can not obtain credit with you , but must add to you suspicion ) will not let I descmend all at once ; and I ask you but a fortnight 's stay , that , after this declaration , I may pacify those proud demand upon I . of how my heart throb ! and I begin ( for I do not know what I do ) to say the 's prayer . none of you bead to I ! say he ; thou be a perfect nun , I think . but I say aloud , with my eye lift up to heaven , lead I not into temptation : but deliver I from evil , of my good ! he hug I in he arm , and say , well , my dear girl , then you stay this fortnight , and you shall see what I will do for you -- I will leave you a moment , and walk into the next room , to give you time to think of it , and to show you I have no design upon you . well , this , I think , do not look amiss . he go out , and I be torture with twenty different doubt in a minute ; sometimes I think that to stay a week or fortnight longer in this house to obey he , while be with I , could do no great harm : but then , think I , how do I know what I may be able to do ? I have withstand he anger ; but may I not relent at he kindness ?-- how shall I stand that .-- well , I hope , think I , by the same protect grace in which I will always confide !-- but , then , what have he promise ? why , he will make my poor father and mother 's life comfortable . o ! say I to myself , that be a rich thought ; but let I not dwell upon it , for fear I should indulge it to my ruin .-- what can he do for I , poor girl as I be ! -- what can he greatness stoop to ! he talk , think I , of he pride of heart , and pride of condition ; of these be in he head , and in he heart too , or he would not confess they to I at such a instant . well then , think I , this can be only to seduce I .-- he have promise nothing . -- but I be to see what he will do , if I stay a fortnight ; and this fortnight , think I again , be no such great matter ; and I shall see in a few day how he carry it . -- but then , when I again reflect upon this distance between he and I , and he now open declaration of love , as he call it ; and that after this he would talk with I on that subject more plainly than ever , and I shall be less armed , may be , to withstand he ; and then I bethotch myself , why , if he mean no dishonour , he should not speak before ; and the odious frightful closet come again into my head , and my narrow escape upon it ; and how easy it might be for he to send and the maid out of the way ; and so that all the mischief he design I might be bring about in less than that time ; I resolve to go away and trust all to , and nothing to myself . and how ought I to be thankful for this resolution !-- as you shall hear . but just as I have writ to this place , send I word , that he be go this minute you way ; and so I will send you so far as I have write , and hope by to - morrow night , to ask you blessing , at you own poor , but happy abode , and tell you the rest by word of mouth ; and so I rest , till then , and for ever , you dutiful daughter . and , I will continue my writing still , because , may be , I shall like to read it , when I be with you , to see what dangers I have be enable to escape ; and though I bring it along with I . I tell you my resolution , my happy resolution as I have reason to think it : and just then he come in again , with great kindness in he look , and say , I make no doubt , , you will stay this fortnight to oblige I . I know not how to frame my word so as to deny , and yet not make he storm . but , say I , forgive , sir , you poor distress servant . I know I can not possibly deserve any favour at you hand , consistent with virtue ; and I beg you will let I go to my poor father . why , say he , thou be the veriest fool that I ever know . I tell you I will see
see you father ; I will send for he hither to - morrow , in my travelling chariot , if you will ; and I will let he know what I intend to do for he and you . what , sir , may I ask you , can that be ? you honour 's noble estate may easily make he happy , and not unuseful , perhaps to you , in some respect or other . but what price be I to pay for all this ?-- shall be happy as you can wish , say he , I do assure you : and here I will now give you this purse , in which be fifty guinea , which I will allow you father yearly , and find a employ suitable to he liking , to deserve that and more : Pamela , he shall never want , depend upon it . I would have give you still more for he , but that , perhaps , you would suspect I intend it as a design upon you .-- of sy , say I , take back you guinea ! I will not touch one , nor will my father , I be sure , till he know what be to be do for they ; and particularly what be to become of I . why then , , say he , suppose I find a man of probity , and genteel call , for a husband for you , that shall make you a gentlewoman as long as you live ?-- I want no husband , sir , say I : for now I begin to see he in all he black colour ! -- yet be so much in he power , I think I would a little dissemble . but , say he , you be so pretty , that go where you will , you can never be free from the design of some or other of we sex ; and I shall think I do not answer the care of my dying mother for you , who commit you to I , if I do not provide you a husband to protect you virtue , and you innocence ; and a worthy one I have think of for you . of black , perfidious creature ! think I , what a implement art thou in the hand of , to ruin the innocent heart !-- yet still I dissemble : for I fear much both he and the place I be in . but , whom , pray sir , have you think of ?-- why , say he , young , my chaplain , in , who will make you happy . do he know , sir , say I , any thing of you honour 's intention ?-- no , my girl , say he , and kiss I , ( much against my will ; for he very breath be now poison to I , ) but he dependance upon my favour , and you beauty and merit , will make he rejoice at my kindness to he . well , sir , say I , then it be time enough to consider of this matter ; and it can not hinder I from go to my father 's : for what will stay a fortnight longer signify to this ? you honour 's care and goodness may extend to I there , as well as here ; and , and all the world , shall know that I be not asham of my father 's poverty . he would kiss I again , and I say , if I be to think of , or any body , I beg you will not be so free with I : that be not pretty , I be sure . well , say he , but you stay this next fortnight , and in that time I will have both and you father here ; for I will have the match conclude in my house ; and when I have bring it on , you shall settle it as you please together . take and send only these fifty piece to you father , as a earnest of my favour , and I will make you all happy . -- , say I , I beg at least two hour to consider off this . I shall , say he , be go out in one hour ; and I would have you write to you father what I propose ; and shall carry it on purpose : and he shall take the purse with he for the good old man , if you approve it . , say I , I will then let you know in one hour my resolution . do so , say he ; and give I another kiss , and let nee go . of how I rejoice I have get out of he clutch ! -- so I write you this , that you may see how matter stand ; for I be resolve to come away , if possible . base , wick , treacherous gentleman as he be ! so here be a trap laid for you poor ! I tremble to think of it ! of what a scene of wickedness be here lay down for all my wretched life ! black - hear wretch ! how I hate he ! -- for , at first , as you will see by what I have write , he would have make I believe other thing ; and this of , I suppose , come into he head after he walk out from he closet , to give himself time to think how to delude I better : but the covering be now too thin , and easy to be see through . I go to my chamber , and the first thing
thing I do be to write to he ; for I think it be best not to see he again , if I could help it ; and I put it under he parlour door , after I have copy it , as follow : ' , ' you last proposal to I convince I , that I ought not to stay , but to go to my father , if it be but to ask he advice about . and I be so set upon it , that I be not to be persuade . so , honoure sir , with a thousand thanks for all favour , I will set out to - morrow early ; and the honour you design I , as tell I , of you chariot , there will be no occasion for : because I can hire , I believe , farmer 's chaise . so , begge you will not take it amiss , I shall ever be ' you dutiful servant . ' ' as to the purse , sir , my poor father , to be sure , will not forgive I , if I take it , till he can know how to deserve it which be impossible . ' so he have just now send to tell I , that since I be resolve to go , go I may , and the travelling chariot shall be ready ; but it shall be worse for I ; for that he will never trouble himself about I as long as he life . well , so I get out of the house , I care not ; only I should have be glad I could , with innocence , have make you , my dear parent , happy . I can not imagine the reason of it , but , who I think be gone with my last , be but now go ; and he send to know if I have any thing else to carry . so I break off to send you this with the former . I be now prepar for my journey , and about take leave of my good fellow - servants : and if I have not time to write , I must tell you the rest , when I be so happy as to be with you . one word more : I slip in a paper of verse , on my go : sad poor stuff ! but as they come from I , you will not dislike they , may be . I shew they to , and she like they , and take a copy ; and make one s they to she , and in the green - room too ; but I look into the closet first . I will only add , that I be you dutiful daughter . let I just say , that he have this moment send I five guinea by , as a present for my pocket : so I shall be very rich ; for as she bring they , I think I might take they . he say he will not see I : and I may go when I will in the morning ; and shall drive I : but he be so angry , he order that nobody shall go out at the door with I , not so much as into the coach - yard . well ! I can not help it , not I ! but do not this expose himself more than I ? but wait , and I would have bring this and the other myself ; but he say , he have put it up among other thing , and so can take both as well as one . be very good , and very honest ; I be under great obligation to he . I would give he a guinea , now I be so rich , if I think he would take it . I hear nothing of my lady 's clothes , and those my master give I : for I tell , I would not take they ; but I fancy , by a word or two that be drop , they will be send after I . dear sir ! what a rich you will have if they should ! but as I can not wear they if they do , I do not desire they ; and if I have they , will turn they into money , as I can have opportunity . well , no more -- I be in a fearful hurry ! Verse on my . I . my fellow - servant dear , attend to these few line , which I have penn ' : I be sure they be from you honest friend , and wisher - well , poor PAMELa . ii .

' do not mistake I , however ; I believe she very honest , and very virtuous ; but I have find out also , that she be carry on a sort of correspondence , or love affair , with a young clergyman , that I hope in time to provide for ; but who , at present , be destitute of any subsistence but my favour : and what would be the consequence , can you think , of two young folk , who have nothing in the world to trust to of they own to come together with a family multiply upon they before they have bread to eat . ' for my part , I have too much kindness to they both , not to endeavou to prevent it , if I can ; and for this reason I have send she out of he way for a little while , till I can bring they both to better consideration ;
; and I would not , therefore , have you be surprised you do not see you daughter so soon as you might possibly expect . ' yet I do assure you , upon my honour , that she shall be safe and inviolate ; and I hope you do not doubt I , notwithstand any air she may have give herself , upon my jocular pleasantry to she , and perhaps a little innocent romping with she , so usual with young folk of the two sex , when they have be long acquainted , and grow up together ; for pride be not my talent . ' as she be a mighty letter - writer , I hope she have have the duty to apprise you of she intrigue with the young clergyman ; and I know not whether it meet with you countenance : but now she be absent for a little while , ( for I know he would have follow she to you village , if she have go home ; and there , perhaps , they would have ruin one another , by marrying , ) I doubt not I shall bring he to see he interest , and that he engage not before he know how to provide for a wife : and when that can be do , let they come together in 's name , for I . 'I expect not to be answer on this head , but by you good opinion , and the confidence you may repose in my honour : being ' you hearty friend to serve you . ' 'P . I find my man have be the manager of the correspondence , in which such liberty have be take with I . I shall soon , in a manner that become I , let the saucy fellow know how much I resent he part of the affair . it be hard thing , that a man of my character in the world should be use thus freely by he own servants . ' it be easy to guess at the poor old man 's concern , upon read this letter from a gentleman of so much consideration . he know not what course to take , and have no manner of doubt of he poor daughter 's innocence , and that foul play be design she . yet he sometimes hope the best , and be ready to believe the surmise correspondence between the clergyman and she , have not receive the letter she write , which would have clear up that affair . but , after all , he resolve , as well to quiet he own as she mother 's uneasiness , to undertake a journey to the ' squire 's ; and leave he poor wife to excuse he to the farmer who employ he , he set out that very evening , late as it be ; and travel all night , find himself , soon after day - light , at the gate of the gentleman , before the family be up : and there he sit down to rest himself till he should see somebody stirr . the grooms be the first he see , come out to water they horse ; and he ask , in so distressful a manner , what be become of , that they think he crazy : and say , why , what have you to do with , old fellow ? get out of the horse ' way .-- where be you master ? say the poor man : pray , gentlemen , do not be angry : my heart 's almost break .-- he never give any thing at the door , I assure you , say one of the grooms ; so you lose you labour . I be not a beggar yet , say the poor old man ; I want nothing of he , but my :--o my child ! my child ! I will be hang , say one of they , if this be not 's father .-- indeed , indeed , say he , wringe he hand , I be ; and weeping , where be my child ? where be my ?-- why , father , say one of they , we beg you pardon ; but she be go home to you : how long have you be come from home ?--o ! but last night , say he ; I have travel all night : be the 'squire at home , or be he not ? --yes , but he be not stirr though , say the groom , as yet . thank for that ! say he ; thank for that ! then I hope I may be permit to speak to he anon . they ask he to go in , and he step into the stable , and sit down on the stair there , wip he eye , and sigh so sadly , that it grieve the servants to hear he . the family be soon raise with a report of 's father come to inquire after he daughter ; and the maid would fain have have he go into the kitchen . but , have be tell of he come , arise , and hasten down to she parlour , and take he in with she , and there hear all he sad story , and read the letter . she weep bitterly , but yet endeavoure , before he , to hide she concern ; and say , well , , I can not help weep at you grief ; but I hope there be no occasion . let nobody see this letter , whatever you do . I dare say you daughter be safe . well , but , say he , I see you , madam , know nothing about she :-- if all be
be right , so good a gentlewoman as you be , would not have be a stranger to this . to be sure you think she be with I ! say she , my master do not always inform he servants of he proceedings ; but you need not doubt he honour . you have he hand for it : and you may see he can have no design upon she , because he be not from hence , and do not talk of go hence . of that be all I have to hope for ! say he ; that be all , indeed !-- but , say he -- and be go on , when the report of he come have reach the ' squire , who come down , in he morning - gown and slipper , into the parlour , where he and be talk . what be the matter , ? say he , what be the matter ? oh my child ! say the good old man , give I my child ! I beseech you .-- why , I think , say the ' squire , that I have satisfi you about she : sure you have not the letter I send you , write with my own hand . yes , yes , but I have , sy , say he ; and that bring I hither ; and I have walk all night . poor man , return he , with great see compassion , I be sorry for it truly ! why , you daughter have make a strange racket in my family ; and if I think it would have disturb you so much , I would have e 'en let she go home ; but what I do be to serve she , and you too . she be very safe , I do assure you , Goodman Andrews ; and you may take my honour for it , I would not injure she for the world . do you think I would , ? no , I hope not , sir , say she .-- hope not ! say the poor man ; so do I ; but pray , sir , give I my child , that be all I desire ; and I will take care no clergyman shall come near she . why , be a great way off , say the ' squire , and I can not send for she back presently . what , then , say he , have you send my poor to ? I would not have say it so , reply the ' squire ; but I assure you , upon my honour , she be quite safe and satisfied , and will quickly inform you of it by letter . she be in a reputable family , no less than a bishop 's , and be to wait on he lady , till I get the matter over that I mention to you . of how shall I know this ? reply he .-- what , say the ' squire , pretend anger , be I to be doubt ?-- do you believe I can have any view upon you daughter ? and if I have , do you think I would take such method as these to effect it ? why , surely , man , thou forgettest whom thou talkest to . o , sir , say he , I beg you pardon ! but consider my dear child be in the case ; let I but know what bishop , and where ; and I will travel to on foot , to see my daughter , and then be satisfied . why , , I think thou hast read romance as well as thy daughter , and thy head 's turn with they . may I have not my word take ? do you think , once more , I would offer any thing dishonourable to you daughter ? be there any thing look like it ?-- Pr'ythee , man , recollect a little who I be ; and if I be not to be believe , what signify talk ? why , sir , say he , pray forgive I ; but there be no harm to say , what bishop 's , or whereabouts ? what , and so you would go trouble he lordship with you impertinent fear and story ! will you be satisfied , if you have a letter from she within a week , it may be less , if she be not negligent , to assure you all be well with she ! why that , say the poor man , will be some comfort . well then , say the gentleman , I can not answer for she negligence , if she do not write : and if she should send a letter to you , , ( for I desire not to see it ; I have have trouble enough about she already , ) be sure you send it by a man and horse the moment you receive it . to be sure I will , answer she . thank you honour , say the good man : and then I must wait with as much patience as I can for a week , which will be a year to I . I tell you , say the gentleman , it must be she own fault if she do not write ; for ' tis what I insist upon , for my own reputation ; and I sha not stir from this house , I assure you , till she be hear from , and that to you satisfaction . bless you honour , say the poor man , as you say and mean truth ! amen , amen , , say he : you see I be not afraid to say amen .
. so , , make the good man as welcome as you can ; and let I have no uproar about the matter . he then , whisper she , bid she give he a couple of guinea to bear he charge home ; tell he , he should be welcome to stay there till the letter come , if he would , and be a witness , that he intend honourably , and not to stir from he house for one while . the poor old man stay and dine with , with some tolerable ease of mind , in hope to hear from he beloved daughter in a few day ; and then accept the present , return for he own house , and resolve to be as patient as possible . , and all the family , be in the utmost grief for the trick put upon the poor Pamela ; and she and the steward represent it to they master in as move term as they durst ; but be force to rest satisfied with he general assurance of intend she no harm ; which , however , little believe , from the pretence he have make in he letter , of the correspondence between and the young parson ; which she know to be all mere invention , though she durst not say so . but the week after , they be make a little more easy by the follow letter bring by a unknown hand , and leave for , which , how procure , will be shew in the sequel . ' . , 'I have be vilely tricke , and , instead of be drive by to my dear father 's , I be carry off , to where , I have no liberty to tell . however , I be at present not use hardly , in the main ; and write to beg of you to let my dear father and mother ( whose heart must be well nigh break ) know that I be well , and that I be , and , by the of , ever will he , they honest , as well as dutiful daughter , and ' you oblige friend , ' . ' ' I must neither send date nor place ; but have most solemn assurance of honourable usage . this be the only time my low estate have be troublesome to I , since it have subjec I to the fright I have undergone . love to you good self , and all my dear fellow - servants . ! adieu ! but pray for poor PAMELa . ' this , though it quiet not entirely they apprehension , be shewn to the whole family , and to the gentleman himself , who pretend not to know how it come ; and send it away to the good old folk ; who at first suspect it be for , and not they daughter 's hand ; but , find the contrary , they be a little easier to hear she be alive and honest : and have inquire of all they acquaintance what could be do , and no one be able to put they in a way how to proceed , with effect , on so extraordinary a occasion , against so rich and so resolute a gentleman ; and be afraid to make matter worse , ( though they see plainly enough , that she be in no bishop 's family , and so mistrust all the rest of he story , ) they apply themselves to prayer for they poor daughter , and for a happy issue to a affair that almost distract they . we shall now leave the honest old pair pray for they dear , and return to the account she herself give of all this ; have write it journal - wise , to amuse and employ she time , in hope some opportunity might offer to send it to she friend ; and , as be she constant view , that she might afterwards thankfully look back upon the dangers she have escape , when they should be happily overblown , as in time she hope they would be ; and that then she might examine , and either approve or repent of she own conduct in they . of my and ! let I write , and bewail my miserable hard fate , though I have no hope how what I write can be convey to you hand !-- I have now nothing to do , but write and weep , and fear and pray ! but yet what can I hope for , when I seem to be devote , as a victim to the will of a wicked violator of all the law of and man !-- but , gracious Heaven , forgive I my rashness and despondency ! o let I not sin against thee ; for thou best knowest what be fittest for thy poor handmaid ! -- and as thou sufferest not thy poor creature to be temp above what they can bear , I will resign myself to thy good pleasure : and still , I hope , desperate as my condition seem , that as these trial be not of my own seek , nor the effect of my presumption and vanity , I shall be enable to overcome they , and , in 's own good time , be deliver from they . thus do I pray imperfectly , as I be force by my distracting fear and apprehension ; and o join with I , my dear parent !-- but , alas ! how can you know , how can I reveal to you , the dreadful situation of you poor daughter ! the unhappy may be undone ( which forbid , and sooner deprive I of life ! ) before you can know
know she hard lot ! of the unparalleled wickedness , stratagem , and device , of those who call themselves gentleman , yet perver the design of Providence , in give they ample mean to do good , to they own everlasting perdition , and the ruin of poor oppressed innocence ! but now I will tell you what have befall I ; and yet , how shall you receive it ? here be no honest to carry my letter to you ! and , besides , I be watch in all my step ; and no doubt shall be , till my hard fate may ripen he wicked project for my ruin . I will every day , however , write my sad state ; and some way , perhaps , may be open to send the melancholy scribble to you . but , alas ! when you know it , what will it do but aggravate you trouble ? for , o ! what can the abject poor do against the mighty rich , when they be determined to oppress ? well , but I must proceed to write what I have hope to tell you in a few hour , when I believe I should receive you grateful blessing , on my return to you from so many hardship . I will begin with my account from the last letter I write you , in which I enclose my poor stuff of verse ; and continue it at time , as I have opportunity ; though , as I say , I know not how it can reach you . the long - hope for morning come , when I be to set out . I have take my leave of my fellow - servants overnight ; and a mournful leave it be to we all : for man , as well as woman servants , wept much to part with I ; and , for my part , I be overwhelm with tear , and the affect instance of they esteem . they all would have make I little present , as token of they love ; but I would not take any thing from the lower servants , to be sure . but would have I accept of several yard of , and a silver snuff - box , and a gold ring , which he desire I to keep for he sake ; and he weep over I ; but say , I be sure so good a maiden will bless ; and though you return to you poor father again , and he low estate , yet Providence will find you out : remember I tell you so ; and one day , though I may not live to see it , you will be reward . I say , o , dear ! you make I too rich , and too mody ; and yet I must be a beggar before my time for I shall want often to be scribbl , ( little think it would be my only employment so soon , ) and I will beg you , sir , to favour I with some paper ; and , as soon as I get home , I will write you a letter , to thank you for all you kindness to I ; and a letter to good too . this be lucky ; for I should have have none else , but at the pleasure of my rough - natured governess , as I may call she ; but now I can write to ease my mind , though I can not send it to you ; and write what I please , for she know not how well I be provide : for good give I above forty sheet of paper , and a dozen pens , and a little phial of ink ; which last I wrap in paper , and put in my pocket ; and some wax and wafer . of dear sir , say I , you have set I up . how shall I requite you ? he say , by a kiss , my fair mistress : and I give it very willingly ; for he be a good old man . and cry sadly , when I take my leave ; and , who sometimes use to be a little crossish , and Cicely too , weep sadly , and say , they would pray for I ; but poor , I doubt , will forget that ; for she seldom say she prayer for herself : more be the pity ! then yoArthu the gardener , we Robin the coachman , and too , who be to carry I , be very civil ; and both have tear in they eye ; which I think then very good - nature in , because he know but little of I .-- but since , I find he might well be concerned ; for he have then he instruction , it seem , and know how he be to be a means to entrap I . then we other three footman , , , and , and grooms , and helper , be very much affect likewise ; and the poor little scullion - boy , , be ready to run over for grief . they have get all together over -night , expect to be differently employ in the morning ; and they all beg to shake hand with I , and I kiss the maiden , and pray to to bless they all ; and thank they for all they love and kindness to I : and , indeed , I be force to leave they sooner than I would , because I could not stand it : indeed I could not . ( I could not have think it ; for he be a little wildish , they say
say ) cry till he sob again . , poor honest , be not then come back from you . but as for the butler , , he could not stay in company . I think to have tell you a deal about this ; but I have worse thing to employ my thought . , good , cry all night long ; and I comforte she all I could : and she make I promise , that if my master go to to attend parliament , or to , I would come and stay a week with she : and she would have give I money ; but I would not take it . well , next morning come , and I wonder I see nothing of poor honest ; for I wait to take leave of he , and thank he for all he civility to I and to you . but I suppose he be send farther by my master , and so could not return ; and I desire to be remember to he . and when tell I , with a sad heart , the chariot be ready with four horse to it , I be just upon sinke into the ground , though I want to be with you . my master be above stair , and never ask to see I . I be glad of it in the main ; but he know , false heart as he be , that I be not to be out of he reach preserve I , Heaven , from he power , and from he wickedness ! well , they be not suffer to go with I one step , as I writ to you before ; for he stand at the window to see I go . and in the passage to the gate , out of he sight , there they stand all of they , in two row ; and we could say nothing on both side , but bless you ! and bless you ! but carry my own bundle , my third bundle , as I be use to call it , to the coach , with some plumb - cake , and diet - bread , make for I over - night , and some sweet - meat , and six bottle of wine , which would make I take in a basket , to cheer we heart now and then , when we get together , as she say . and I kiss all the maid again , and shake hand with the man again : but and be not there ; and then I trip down the step to the chariot , cry most sadly . I look up when I get to the chariot , and I see my master at the window , in he gown ; and I courtesy three time to he very low , and pray for he with my hand lift up ; for I could not speak ; indeed I be not able : and he bow he head to I , which make I then very glad he would take such notice of I ; and in I step , and be ready to burst with grief ; and could only , till begin to drive , wave my white handkerchief to they , wet with my tear : and , at last , away he drive , - like , as they say , out of the court - yard . and I too soon find I have cause for greater and deeper grief . well , say I to myself , at this rate I shall soon be with my dear father and mother ; and till I have get , as I suppose , half - way , I think of the good friend I have leave : and when , on stopping for a little bait to the horse , tell I I be near half - way , I think it be high time to wipe my eye , and think to whom I be go ; as then , alack for I ! I think . so I begin to ponder what a meeting I should have with you ; how glad you would both be to see I come safe and innocent to you , after all my dangers : and so I begin to comfort myself , and to banish the other gloomy side from my mind ; though , too , it return now and then ; for I should be ungrateful not to love they for they love . well , I believe I set out about eight o'clock in the morning ; and I wonder and wonder , when it be about two , as I see by a church dial , in a little village as we pass through , that I be still more and more out of my knowledge . hey - day , think I , to drive this strange pace , and to be so long a go a little more than twenty mile , be very odd ! but to be sure , think I , know the way . at last he stop , and look about he , as if he be at a loss for the road ; and I say , , sure you be out of the way !-- I be afraid I be , say he . but it can not be much ; I will ask the first person I see . pray do , say I ; and he give he horse a mouthful of bay : and I give he some cake , and two glass of wine ; and stopt about half a hour in all . then he drive on very fast again . I have so much to think of , of the dangers I now doubt not I have escape
escape , of the loving friend I have leave , and my best friend I be go to ; and the many thing I have to relate to you ; that I the less thought of the way , till I be start out of my meditations by the sun begin to set , and still the man drive on , and he horse sweat and foam ; and then I begin to be alarme all at once , and call to he ; and he say he have horrid ill luck , for he have come several mile out of the way , but be now right , and should get in still before it be quite dark . my heart begin then to misgive I a little , and I be very much fatigue ; for I have no sleep for several night before , to signify ; and at last I say , , there be a town before we , what do you call it ? -- if we be so much out of the way , we have better put up there , for the night come on apace : and , protect I ! think I , I shall have new dangers , mayhap , to encounter with the man , who have escape the master -- little think of the base contrivance of the latter . -- say he , I be just there : ' Tis but a mile on one side of the town before we .-- Nay , say I , I may be mistaken ; for it be a good while since I be this way ; but I be sure the face of the country here be nothing like what I remember it . he pretend to be much out of humour with himself for mistak the way , and at last stop at a farmhouse , about two mile beyond the village I have see ; and it be then almost dark , and he alight , and say , we must make shift here ; for I be quite out . , think I , be good to the poor Pamela ! more trials still !-- what will befall I next ? the farmer 's wife , and maid , and daughter , come out ; and the wife say , what bring you this way at this time of night , ? and with a lady too ?--Then I begin to be frightene out of my wit ; and lay middle and both end together , I fall a crying , and say , give I patience ! I be undone for certain ! -- pray , mistress , say I , do you know ' -- --, of ? the wicked coachman would have prevent the answer I ; but the simple daughter say , know he worship ! yes , surely ! why he be my father 's landlord .-- well , say I , then I be undone ; undone for ever !--o , wick wretch ! what have I do to you , say I to the coachman , to serve I thus ?-- Vile tool of a wicked master !-- , say the fellow , I be sorry this task be put upon I ; but I could not help it . but make the best of it now ; here be very civil reputable folk ; and you will be safe here , I will assure you .-- let I get out , say I , and I will walk back to the town we come through , late as it be :-- for I will not enter here . say the farmer 's wife , you will be very well use here , I will assure you , young gentlewoman , and have better conveniences than any where in the village . I matter not convenience , say I : I be betrayed and undone ! as you have a daughter of you own , pity I , and let I know if you landlord , as you call he , be here !-- no , I will assure you he be not , say she . and then come the farmer , a good - like sort of man , grave , and well - behave ; and speak to I in such sort , as make I a little pacified ; and see no help for it , I go in ; and the wife immediately conduct I up stair to the best apartment , and tell I , that be mine as long as I stay : and nobody should come near I but when I call . I throw myself on the bed in the room , tired and frightene to death almost ; and give way to the most excessive fit of grief that I ever have . the daughter come up , and say , have give she a letter to give I ; and there it be . I raise myself , and see it be the hand and seal of the wicked wretch , my master , direct to .-- this be a little better than to have he here ; though , if he have , he must have be bring through the air ; for I think I be . the good woman ( for I begin to see thing about a little reputable , and no guile appear in they , but rather a face of grief for my grief ) offer I a glass of some cordial water , which I accept , for I be ready to sink ; and then I sit up in a chair a little , though very faintish : and they bring I two candle , and light a brushwood fire ; and say , if I call , I should be wait on instantly ; and so leave I to
to ruminate on my sad condition , and to read my letter , which I be not able to do presently . after I have a little come to myself , I find it to contain these word : ' , ' the passion I have for you , and you obstinacy , have constrain I to act by you in a manner that I know will occasion you great trouble and fatigue , both of mind and body . yet , forgive I , my dear girl ; for , although I have take this step , I will , by all that be good and holy ! use you honourably . not you fear to transport you to a behaviour that will be disreputable to we both : for the place where you will receive this , be a farm that belong to I ; and the people civil , honest , and oblige . ' you will , by this time , be far on you way to the place I have allot for you abode for a few week , till I have manage some affair , that will make I show myself to you in a much different light , than you may possibly apprehend from this rash action : and to convince you , that I mean no harm , I do assure you , that the house you be go to , shall be so much at you command , that even I myself will not approach it without leave from you . so make yourself easy ; be discreet and prudent ; and a happier turn shall reward these you trouble , than you may at present apprehend . ' meantime I pity the fatigue you will have , if this come to you hand in the place I have direct : and will write to you father to satisfy he , that nothing but what be honourable shall be offer to you , by you passionate admirer , ( so I must style myself , ) ' ---------------' do not think hardly of poor : you have so possess all my servants in you favour , that I find they have rather serve you than I ; and ' tis reluctantly the poor fellow undertake this task ; and I be force to submit to assure he of my honourable intention to you , which I be fully resolve to make good , if you compel I not to a contrary conduct . ' I but too well apprehend that the letter be only to pacify I for the present ; but as my danger be not so immediate as I have reason to dread , and he have promise to forbear come to I , and to write to you , my dear parent , to quiet you concern , I be a little more easy than before and i make shift to eat a little bit of boiled chicken they have get for I , and drank a glass of my sack , and make each of they do so too . but after I have so do , I be again a little flustered ; for in come the coachman with the look of a hangman , I think , and madam I up strangely ; tell I , he would beg I to get ready to pursue my journey by five in the morning , or else he should be late in . I be quite grieve at this ; for I begin not to dislike my company , consider how thing stand ; and be in hope to get a party among they , and so to put myself into any worthy protection in the neighbourhood , rather than go forward . when he withdraw , I begin to tamper with the farmer and he wife . but , alas ! they have have a letter deliver they at the same time I have ; so securely have put it into he head to do he work ; and they only shook they head , and see to pity I ; and so I be force to give over that hope . however , the good farmer shew I he letter ; which I copy as follow : for it discover the deep art of this wick master ; and how resolve he seem to be on my ruin , by the pain he take to deprive I of all hope of free myself from he power . ' , 'I send to you house , for one night only , a young gentlewoman , much against she will , who have deeply embark in a love affair , which will be she ruin , as well as the person 's to whom she want to betroth herself . I have , to oblige she father , order she to be carry to one of my house , where she will be well use , to try , if by absence , and expostulation with both , they can be bring to know they own interest and I be sure you will use she kindly for my sake : for , except this matter , which she will not own , she do not want prudence and discretion . I will acknowledge any trouble you shall be at in this matter the first opportunity ; and am ' you and . ' he have say , too cunningly for I , that I would not own this pretend love affair ; so that he have provide they not to believe I , say what I would ; and as they be he tenant , who all love he , ( for he have some amiable quality , and so he have need ! ) I see all my plot cut out , and so be force to say the less . I weep bitterly , however ;
; for I find he be too hard for I , as well in he contrivance as riche ; and so have recourse again to my only refuge , comforte myself , that never fail to take the innocent heart into he protection , and be alone able to baffle and confound the device of the mighty . Nay , the farmer be so prepossessed with the contents of he letter , that he begin to praise he care and concern for I , and to advise I against entertaining address without my friend 's advice and consent ; and make I the subject of a lesson for he daughter 's improvement . so I be glad to shut up this discourse ; for I see I be not likely to be believe . I send , however , to tell my driver , that I be so fatigue , I could not get out so soon the next morning . but he insist upon it , and say , it would make my day 's journey the lighter ; and I find he be a more faithful servant to he master , notwithstand what he write of he reluctance , than I could have wish : I see still more and more , that all be deep dissimulation , and contrivance worse and worse . indeed I might have shewn they he letter to I , as a full confutation of he to they ; but I see no probability of engage they in my behalf : and so think it signify little , as I be to go away so soon , to enter more particularly into the matter with they ; and besides , I see they be not inclinable to let I stay longer , for fear of disoblige he so I go to bed , but have very little rest : and they would make they servant - may bear I company in the chariot five mile , early in the morning , and she be to walk hack . I have contrive in my thought , when I be on my way in the chariot , on morning , that when we come into some town to bait , as he must do for the horse ' sake , I would , at the inn , apply myself , if I see I any way could , to the mistress of the inn , and tell she the case , and to refuse to go farther , have nobody but this wick coachman to contmend with . well , I be very full of this project , and in great hope , some how or other , to extricate myself in this way . but , oh ! the artful wretch have provide for even this last refuge of mine ; for when we come to put up at a large town on the way , to eat a morsel for dinner , and I be fully resolve to execute my project , who should be at the inn that he put up at , but the wick , expect I ! and she sister - in - law be the mistress of it ; and she have provide a little entertainment for I . and this I find , when I desire , as soon as I come in , to speak with the mistress of the house . she come to I : and I say , I be a poor unhappy young body , that want you advice and assistance ; and you seem to be a good sort of a gentlewoman , that would assist a oppress innocent person . yes , madam , say she , I hope you guess right ; and I have the happiness to know something of the matter before you speak . pray call my sister Jewkes .-- Jewkes ! Jewkes ! think I ; I have hear of that name ; I do not like it . then the wicked creature appear , whom I have never see but once before , and I be terrify out of my wit . no stratagem , think I , not one ! for a poor innocent girl ; but every thing to turn out against I ; that be hard indeed ! so I begin to pull in my horn , as they say , for I see I be now worse off than at the farmer 's . the naughty woman come up to I with a air of confidence , and kiss I : see , sister , say she , here be a charming creature ! would she not tempt the best lord in the land to run away with she ? of frightful ! think I ; here be a avowal of the matter at once : I be now go , that be certain . and so be quite silent and confound ; and see no help for it , ( for she would not part with I out of she sight ) I be force to set out with she in the chariot for she come thither on horseback , with a man - servant , who ride by we the rest of the way , lead she horse : and now I give over all thought of redemption , and be in a desponding condition indeed . well , think I , here be strange pain take to ruin a poor innocent , helpless , and even worthless young body . this plot be laid too deep , and have be too long hatching , to be baffle , I fear . but then I put my trust in , who I know be able to do every thing for I , when all other possible means should fail : and in he I be resolve to confide . you may see --( yet , oh ! that kill
kill I ; for I know not whether ever you can see what I now write or no -- you will see ) -- what sort of woman that be , compare to good , by this :---- every now and then she would be star in my face , in the chariot , and squeeze my hand , and say , why , you be very pretty , my silent dear ! and once she offer to kiss I . but I say , I do not like this sort of carriage , ; it be not like two person of one sex . she fall a laughing very confidently , and say , that be prettily say , I vow ! then thou hadst rather be kiss by the other sex ? 'i fackin , I commend thee for that ! I be sadly tease with she impertinence , and bold way ; but no wonder ; she be innkeeper 's housekeeper , before she come to my master ; and those sort of creature do not want confidence , you know : and indeed she make nothing to talk boldly on twenty occasion ; and say two or three time , when she see the tear every now and then , as we ry , trickle down my cheek , I be sorely hurt , truly , to have the handsomest and finest young gentleman in five county in love with I ! so I find I be get into the hand of a wicked procuress ; and if I be not safe with good , and where every body love I , what a dreadful prospect have I now before I , in the hand of a woman that seem to delight in filthiness ! of dear sir ! what shall I do ! what shall I do !-- surly , I shall never be equal to all these thing ! about eight at night , we enter the court - yard of this handsome , large , old , and lonely mansion , that look make for solitude and mischief , as I think , by its appearance , with all its brown nodding horror of lofty elm and pine about it : and here , say I to myself , I fear , be to be the scene of my ruin , unless protect I , who be all - sufficient ! I be very sick at enter it , partly from fatigue , and partly from dejection of spirit : and get I some mull wine , and seem mighty officious to welcome I thither ; and while she be absent , order the wine , the wicked come in to I , and say , I beg a thousand pardon for my part in this affair , since I see you grief and you distress ; and I do assure you , that I be sorry it fall to my task . Mighty well , ! say I ; I never see a execution but once , and then the hangman ask the poor creature 's pardon , and wip he mouth , as you do , and plead he duty , and then calmly tuck up the criminal . but I be no criminal , as you all know : and if I could have think it my duty to obey a wick master in he unlawful command , I have save you all the merit of this vile service . I be sorry , say he , you take it so : but every body do not think alike . well , say I , you have do you part , , towards my ruin , very faithfully ; and will have cause to be sorry , may be , at the long run , when you shall see the mischief that come of it .-- you eye be open , and you know I be to be carry to my father 's , and that I be barbarously tricked and betrayed ; and I can only , once more , thank you for you part of it . forgive you ! so he go away a little sad . what have you say to , madam ? say : ( who come in as he go out :) the poor fellow 's ready to cry . I need not be afraid of you follow he example , , say I : I have be tell he , that he have do he part to my ruin : and he now can not help it ! so he repentance do I no good ; I wish it may he . I will assure you , madam , say she , I should be as ready to cry as he , if I should do you any harm . it be not in he power to help it now , say I ; but you part be to come , and you may choose whether you will contribute to my ruin or not .-- why , look ye , madam , say she , I have a great notion of do my duty to my master ; and therefore you may depend upon it , if I can do that , and serve you , I will : but you must think , if you desire , and he will , come to clash once , I shall do as he bid I , let it be what it will . , , say I , do not madam I so : I be but a silly poor girl , set up by the gambol of fortune , for a - game ; and now be to be something , and now nothing , just as that think fit to sport with I : and let you and I talk upon a foot together ; for I be a servant inferior to
to you , and so much the more , as I be turn out of place . ay , ay , say she , I understand something of the matter ; you have so great power over my master , that you may soon be mistress of we all ; and so I would oblige you , if I could . and I must and will call you madam ; for I be instruct to show you all respect , I will assure you . who instruct you so to do ? say I . who ! my master , to be sure , say she . why , say I , how can that be ? you have not see he lately . no , that be true , say she ; but I have be expect you here some time ; ( of the deep laid wickedness ! think I :) and , besides , I have a letter of instruction by ; but , may be , I should not have say so much . if you would show they to I , say I , I should be able to judge how far I could , or could not , expect favou from you , consistent with you duty to we master . I beg you pardon , fair mistress , for that , say she , I be sufficiently instruct ; and you may depend upon it , I will observe my order ; and , so far as they will let I , so far will I oblige you ; and there be a end of it . well , say I , you will not , I hope , do a unlawful or wicked thing , for any master in the world . look ye , say she , he be my master ; and if he bid I do any thing that I can do , I think I ought to do it ; and let he , who have he power to command I , look to the lawfulness of it . why , say I , suppose he should bid you cut my throat , would you do it ? there be no danger of that , say she ; but to be sure I would not ; for then I should be hang ! for that would be murder . well , say I , and suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature , and ruin she , would you assist he in that ? for to rob a person of she virtue be worse than cut she throat . why now , say she , how strangely you talk ! be not the two sex make for one another ? and be it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty woman ? and suppose he can obtain he desire , be that so bad as cut she throat ? and then the wretch fall a laughing , and talk most impertinently , and shew I , that I have nothing to expect from she virtue or conscience : and this give I great mortification ; for I be in hope of work upon she by degree . so we end we discourse here , and I bid she show I where I must lie .-- why , say she , lie where you list , madam ; I can tell you , I must lie with you for the present . for the present ! say I , and torture then wrng my heart ! -- but be it in you instruction , that you must lie with I ? yes , indeed , say she .-- I be sorry for it , say I . why , say she , I be wholesome , and cleanly too , I will assure you . yes , say I , I do not doubt that ; but I love to lie by myself . how so ? say she ; be not you bed - fellow at t'other house ? well , say I , quite sick of she , and my condition ; you must do as you be instruct , I think . I can not help myself , and be a most miserable creature . she repeat she insufferable nonsense . Mighty miserable , indeed , to be so well belove by one of the finest gentleman in ! I be now come down in my writing to this present Saturday , and a deal I have write . my wick bed - fellow have very punctual order , it seem ; for she lock I and herself in , and ty the two key ( for there be a double door to the room ) about she wrist , when she go to be . she talk of the house have be attempt to be break open two or three time ; whether to fright I , I can not tell ; but it make I fearful ; though not so much as I should be , if I have not other and greater fear . I sleep but little last night , and get up , and pretend to sit by the window , which look into the spacious garden ; but I be write all the time , from break of day , to she get up , and after , when she be absent . at breakfast she present the two maid to I , the cook and house - maid , poor awkward soul , that I can see no hope of , they seem so devoted to she and ignorance . yet I be resolve , if possible , to find some way to escape , before this wick master come . there be , besides , of servants , the coachman , , a groom , a helper , a footman ; all but ,
, ( and he be accessary to my ruin , ) strange creatur , that promise nothing ; and all likewise devote to this woman . the gardener look like a good honest man ; but he be keep at a distance , and seem reserve . I wonder I see not the clergyman , but would not ask after he , apprehend it might give some jealousy ; but when I have beheld the rest , he be the only one I have hope of ; for I think he cloth would set he above assisting in my ruin .-- but in the afternoon he come ; for it seem he have a little latin school in the neighbouring village , which he attend ; and this bring he in a little matter , additional to my master 's favour , till something better fall , of which he have hope . he be a sensible sober young gentleman ; and when I see he I confirm myself in my hope of he ; for he seem to take great notice of my distress and grief ; ( for I could not hide it ;) though he appear fearful of , who watch all we motion and word . he have a apartment in the house ; but be mostly at a lodging in the town , for a conveniency of he little school ; only on afternoon and Sunday : and he preach sometimes for the minister of the village , which be about three mile off . I hope to go to church with he to - morrow : sure it be not in she instructions to deny I ! he can not have thought of every thing ! and something may strike out for I there . I have ask she , for a feint , ( because she sha not think I be so well provide , ) to indulge I with pen and ink , though I have be use my own so freely when she absence would let I ; for I beg to be leave to myself as much as possible . she say she will let I have it ; but then I must promise not to send any write out of the house , without she see it . I say , it be only to divert my grief when I be by myself , as I desire to be ; for I love write as well as reading ; but I have nobody to send to , she know well enough . no , not at present , may be , say she ; but I be tell you be a great writer ; and it be in my instruction to see all you write : so , look you here , say she , I will let you have a pen and ink , and two sheet of paper : for this employment will keep you out of worse thought : but i must see they always when I ask , write or not write . that be very hard , say I ; but may I not have to myself the closet in the room where we lie , with the key to lock up my thing ? I believe I may consent to that , say she ; and I will set it in order for you , and leave the key in the door . and there be a spinnet too , say she ; if it be in tune , you may play to divert you now and then ; for I know my old lady lear not you : and below be my master 's library : you may take out what book you will . and , indeed , these and my writing will be all my amusement : for I have no work give I to do ; and the spinnet , if in tune , will not find my mind , I be sure , in tune to play upon it . but I go directly and pick out some book from the library , with which I fill a shelf in the closet she give I possession of ; and from these I hope to receive improvement , as well as amusement . but no sooner be she back turn , than I set about hide a pen of my own here , and another there , for fear I should come to be deny , and a little of my ink in a broken cup , and a little in another cup ; and a sheet of paper here and there among my linen , with a little of the wax , and a few wafer , in several place , lest I should be search ; and something , I think , might happen to open a way for my deliverance , by these or some other means . of the pride , think I , I shall have , if I can secure my innocence , and escape the artful wile of this wicked master ! for , if he come hither , I be undone , to be sure ! for this naughty woman will assist he , rather than fail , in the worst of he attempt ; and he will have no occasion to send she out of the way , as he would have do once . so I must set all my little wit at work . it be a grief to I to write , and not to be able to send to you what I write : but now it be all the diversion I have , and if will favour my escape with my innocence , as I trust he graciously will , for all these black prospect , with what pleasure shall I read they afterwards ! I be go to say , pray for you dutiful daughter
daughter , as I use ; but , alas ! you can not know my distress , though I be sure I have you prayer : and I will write on as thing happen , that if a way should open , my scribble may be ready to be send : for what I do , must be at a jerk , to be sure . of how I want such a oblige honest - hear man as ! I be now come to Sunday . well , here be a sad thing ! I be deny by this barbarous woman to go to church , as I have build upon I might : and she have huff poor all to piece , for pleading for I . I find he be to be forbid the house , if she please . poor gentleman ! all he dependance be upon my master , who have a very good living for he , if the incumbent die ; and he have keep he be these four month , of old age and dropsy . he pay I great respect , and I see pity I ; and would , perhaps , assist my escape from these dangers : but I have nobody to plead for I ; and why should I wish to ruin a poor gentleman , by engage he against he interest ? yet one would do any thing to preserve one 's innocence ; and would , perhaps , make it up to he ! of judge ( but how shall you see what I write ! ) of my distracted condition , to be reduce to such a pass as to a desire to lay trap for mankind ! but he want sadly to say something to I , as he whisperingly hint . the wretch ( I think I will always call she the wretch henceforth ) abuse I more and more . I be but talk to one of the maid just now , indeed a little to tamper with she by degree : and she popt upon we , and say -- Nay , madam , do not offer to tempt poor innocent country maiden from do they duty . you want , I hear , she should take a walk with you . but I charge you , , never stir with she , nor obey she , without let I know it , in the smallest trifle .-- I say , walk with you ! and where would you go , I tro' ? why , barbarous , say I , only to look a little up the elm - walk , since you would not let I go to church . , say she , to show I how much they be all in she power , pull off madam 's shoe , and bring they to I . I have take care of she other .-- indeed she sha not , say I , say , but I must if my mistress bid I : so pray , madam , do not hinder I . and so indeed ( would you believe it ? ) she take my shoe off , and leave I barefoot : and , for my share , I have be so frighted at this , that I have not power even to relieve my mind by my tear . I be quite stupefy to be sure !-- here I be force to leave off . now I will give you a picture of this wretch : she be a broad , squat , pursy , fat thing , quite ugly , if any thing human can be so call ; about forty year old . she have a huge hand , and a arm as thick as my waist , I believe . she nose be flat and crook , and she brows grow down over she eye ; a dead spiteful , grey , goggl eye , to be sure she have . and she face be flat and broad ; and as to colour , look like as if it have be pick a month in saltpetre : I dare say she drink :-- she have a hoarse , man - like voice , and be as thick as she be long ; and yet look so deadly strong , that I be afraid she would dash I at she foot in a instant , if I be to vex she .-- so that with a heart more ugly than she face , she frighten I sadly : and I be undone to be sure , if do not protect I ; for she be very , very wicked -- indeed she be . this be poor helpless spite in I :-- but the picture be too near the truth notwithstand . she send I a message just now , that I shall have my shoe again , if I will accept of she company to walk with I in the garden .-- to waddle with I , rather , think I . well , ' ti not my business to quarrel with she downright . I shall be watch the narrower , if I do ; and so I will go with the hate wretch .--o for my dear ! or , rather , to be safe with my dear father and mother . oh ! I be out of my wit for joy ! just as I have get my shoe on , I be tell , honest , be come on horseback !-- a blessing on he faithful heart ! what joy be this ! but I will tell you more by and by . I must not let she know I be so glad to see this dear bless , to be sure !-- ! but he look sad , as I see he out of the window ! what
what can be the matter !-- I hope my dear parent be well , and , and , and every body , my naughty master not except ; -- for I wish he to live and repent of all he wickedness to poor I . of dear heart ! what a world do we live in !-- I be now come to take up my pen again : but I be in a sad take truly ! another puzzling trial , to be sure . here be , as I say , and the poor man come to I , with , who whisper , that I would say nothing about the shoe , for my own sake , as she say . the poor man see my distress , by my red eye , and my hag look , I suppose ; for I have have a sad time of it , you must need think ; and though he would have hide it , if he could , yet he own eye run over . oh , ; say he ; oh , ! well , honest fellow - servant , say I , I can not help it at present : I be oblige to you honesty and kindness , to be sure ; and then he weep more . , ( for my heart be ready to break to see he grief ; for it be a touching thing to see a man cry ) , tell I the worst ! be my master come ? no , no , say he , and sob .-- well , say I , be there any news of my poor father and mother ? how do they do ?--i hope well , say he , I know nothing to the contrary . there be no mishap , I hope , to or to , or my fellow- servants !-- no --said he , poor man ! with a long -- of , as if he heart would burst . well , thank then ! say I . the man be a fool , say . Jewkes , I think : what ado be here ! why , sure thout 'rt in love , . Dost thou not see young madam be well ? what ail thee , man ? nothing at all , say he ; but I be such a fool as to cry for joy to see good : but I have a letter for you . I take it , and see it be from my master ; so I put it in my pocket . , say I , you need not , I hope , see this . no , no , say she , I see whose it be , well enough ; or else , may be , I must have insist on read it . and here be one for you , , say he ; but yours , say he to I , require a answer , which I must carry back early in the morning , or to - night , if I can . you have no more , , say , for , have you ? no , say he , I have not , but every body 's kind love and service . ay , to we both , to be sure , say she . , say I , I will read the letter , and pray take care of yourself ; for you be a good man , bless you ! and I rejoice to see you , and hear from you all . but I longe to say more ; only that nasty . so I go up , and lock myself in my closet , and open the letter ; and this be a copy of it : ' my , 'i send purposely to you on a affair that concern you very much , and I somewhat , but chiefly for you sake . I be conscious that I have proceed by you in such a manner as may justly alarm you fear , and give concern to you honest friend : and all my pleasure be , that I can and will make you amend for the disturbance I have give you . as I promise , I send to you father the day after you departure , that he might not be too much concerned for you , and assure he of my honour to you ; and make a excuse , such a one as ought to have satisfy he , for you not come to he . but this be not sufficient , it seem ; for he , poor man ! come to I next morning , and set my family almost in a uproar about you . 'o my dear girl ! what trouble have not you obstinacy give I , and yourself too ! I have no way to pacify he , but to promise that he should see a letter write from you to , to satisfy he you be well . ' now all my care in this case be for you aged parent , lest they should be touch with too fatal a grief ; and for you , whose duty and affection for they I know to be so strong and laudable ; for this reason I beg you will write a few line to they , and let I prescribe the form ; which I have do , put myself as near as I can in you place , and express you sense , with a warmth that I doubt will have too much possess you . ' after what be do , and which can not now be help , but which , I assure you , shall turn out honourably for you , I expect not to be refuse ; because I can not possibly have any
any view in it , but to satisfy you parent ; which be more you concern than mine ; and so I must beg you will not alter one tittle of the underneath . if you do , it will be impossible for I to send it , or that it should answer the good end I propose by it . 'I have promise , that I will not approach you without you leave . if I find you easy , and not attempt to dispute or avoid you present lot , I will keep to my word , although it be a difficulty upon I . shall you restraint last long : for I will assure you , that I be resolve very soon to convince you of my good intention , and with what ardou I be 's yours , etc. ' the letter he prescribe for I be as this : ' , 'I have , instead of be drive by to my dear father 's , be carry off , where I have no liberty to tell . however , at present , I be not use hardly ; and I write to beg you to let my dear father and mother , whose heart must be well nigh break , know that I be well ; and that I be , and , by the of , ever will be , there honest , as well as dutiful daughter , and ' you oblige friend . ' 'I must neither send date nor place ; but have most solemn assurance of honourable usage . ' I know not what to do on this most strange request and occasion . but my heart b so much for you , my dear father , who have take the pain to go yourself , and inquire after you poor daughter , as well as for my dear mother , that I resolve to write , and pretty much in the above form , that it might be send to pacify you , till I could let you , somehow or other , know the true state of the matter . and I write thus to my strange wick master himself : ' sir , ' if you know but the anguish of my mind , and how much I suffer by you dreadful usage of I , you would surely pity I , and consent to my deliverance . what have I do , that I should be the only mark of you cruelty ? I can have no hope , no desire of live leave I , because I can not have the least dependence , after what have pass , upon you solemn assurance .-- it be impossible they should be consistent with the dishonourable method you take . ' nothing but you promise of not see I here in my deplorable bondage , can give I the least ray of hope . ' do not , I beseech you , drive the poor distress upon a rock , that may be the destruction both of she soul and body ! you do not know , sir , how dreadfully I dare , weak as I be of mind and intellect , when my virtue be in danger . and , of ! hasten my deliverance , that a poor unworthy creature , below the notice of such a gentleman as you , may not be make the sport of a high condition , for no reason in the world , but because she be not able to defend herself , nor have a friend that can right she . 'I have , sir , in part to show my obedience to you , but indeed , I own , more to give ease to the mind of my poor distressed parent , whose poverty , one would think , should scree they from violence of this sort , as well as they poor daughter , follow pretty much the form you have prescribe for I , in the letter to ; and the alteration I have make ( for I could not help a few ) be of such a nature , as , though they show my concern a little , yet must answer the end you be pleased to say you propose by this letter . ' for 's sake , good sir , pity my lowly condition , and my present great misery ; and let I join with all the rest of you servants to bless that goodness , which you have extend to every one but the poor afflict , heart - break ' PAMELA . ' I think , when I have write this letter , and that which he have prescribe , it would look like place a confidence in , to show they to she ; and I shew she , at the same time , my master 's letter to I ; for I believe the value he express for I , would give I credit with one who profess in every thing to serve he , right or wrong ; though I have so little reason , I fear , to pride myself in it : and I be not mistake ; for it have seem to influence she not a little , and she be at present mighty oblige , and run over in my praise ; but be the less to be mind , because she praise as much the author of my misery , and he honourable intention , as she call they ; for I see , that she be capable of thinking , as I fear he do , that every thing that make for he wicked will be honourable , though to the ruin of the innocent . I may find it otherwise ! though , I hope , whatever the wicked gentleman may intend , that I shall be
be at last rid of she impertinent bold way of talk , when she seem to think , from he letter , that he mean honourably . I be now come to , the 5th day of my Bondage and misery . I be in hope to have a opportunity to see , and have a little private talk with he , before he go away ; but it could not be . the poor man 's excessive sorrow make take it into she head , to think he love I ; and so she bring up a message to I from he this morning that he be go . I desire he might come up to my closet , as I call it , and she come with he . the honest man , as I think he , be as full of concern as before , at take leave and I give he two letter , the one for , enclose in another for my master : but . would see I seal they up , lest I should enclose any thing else .-- I be surprised , at the man have go away , to see he drop a bit of paper , just at the head of the stair , which I take up without be observe by : but I be a thousand time more surprised , when I return to my closet , and open it read as follow : ' good Mr . Pamela , 'I be grieve to tell you how much you have be deceive and betray , and that by such a vile dog as I . little do I think it would come to this . but I must say , if ever there be a rogue in the world , it be I . I have all along shew you letter to my master : he employ I for that purpose ; and he see every one , before I carry they to you father and mother ; and then scal they up , and send I with they . I have some business that way , but not half so often as I pretend : and as soon as I hear how it be , I be ready to hang myself . you may well think I could not stand in you presence . of vile , vile wretch , to bring you to this ! if you be ruin , I be the rogue that cause it . all the justice I can do you , be to tell you , you be in vile hand ; and I be afraid will be undone in spite of all you sweet innocence ; and I believe I shall never live , after I know it . if you can forgive I , you be exceed good ; but I shall never forgive myself , that be certain . Howsomever , it will do you no good to make this know ; and may -hap I may live to do you service . if I can , I will : I be sure I ought .-- master keep you last two or three letter , and do not send they at all . I be the most abandoned wretch of wretch . . . ' ' you see you undoing have be long hatch . pray take care of you sweet self . be a devil : but in my master 's t'other house you have not one false heart , but myself . out upon I for a villain ! ' my dear father and mother , when you come to this place , I make no doubt you hair will stand on end as mine do !-- of the deceitfulness of the heart of man !-- this , that I take to be the honestest of man ; that you take for the same ; that be always praise you to I , and I to you , and for nothing so much as for we honest heart ; this very fellow be all the while a vile hypocrite , and a perfidious wretch , and help to carry on my ruin . but he say so much of himself , that I will only sit down with this sad reflection , that power and rich never want tool to promote they vilest end , and there be nothing so hard to be know as the heart of man :-- I can but pity the poor wretch , since he seem to have great remorse , and I believe it best to keep he wickedness secret . if it lie in my way , I will encourage he penitence ; for I may possibly make some discoveries by it . one thing I should mention in this place ; he bring down , in a portmanteau , all the clothes and thing my lady and master have give I , and moreover two velvet hood , and a velvet scarf , that use to be wear by my lady ; but I have no comfort in they , or any thing else . have the portmanteau bring into my closet , and she shew I what be in it ; but then lock it up , and say , she would let I have what I would out of it , when I ask ; but if I have the key , it might make I want to go abroad , may be ; and so the confident woman put it in she pocket . I give myself over to sad reflection upon this strange and surprising discovery of 's , and weep much for he , and for myself too ; for now I see , as he say , my ruin have be long hatching , that I can make no doubt what my master 's honourable profession will end in . what a heap
heap of hard name do the poor fellow call himself ! but what must they deserve , then , who set he to work ? o what have this wicked master to answer for , to be so corrupt himself , and to corrupt other , who would have be all innocent ; and to carry on a poor plot , I be sure for a gentleman , to ruin a poor creature , who never do he harm , nor wish he any ; and who can still pray for he happiness , and he repentance ? I can not but wonder what these gentleman , as they be call , can think of themselves for these vile doings ! have some inducement ; for he hope to please he master , who reward he and be bountiful to he ; and the same may be say , bad as she be , for this same odious Jewkes . but what inducement have my master for take so much pain to do the devil 's work for he ? -- if he love I , as ' tis falsely call , must he therefore lay trap for I , to ruin I and make I as bad as himself ? I can not imagine what good the undoing of such a poor creature as I can procure he .-- to be sure , I be a very worthless body . people , indeed , say I be handsome ; but if I be so , should not a gentleman prefer a honest servant to a guilty harlot ? and must he be more earnest to seduce I , because I dread of all thing to be seduce , and would rather lose my life than my honesty ? well , these be strange thing to I ! I can not account for they , for my share ; but sure nobody will say , that these fine gentleman have any tempter but they own wicked wills !-- he naughty master could run away from I , when he apprehend he servants might discover he vile attempt upon I in that sad closet affair ; but be it not strange that he should not be afraid of the all - see eye , from which even that base plott heart of he , in its most secret motion , could not be hide ? --but what avail I these sorrowful reflection ? he be and will be wick , and design I a victim to he lawless attempt , if the in whom I trust , and to whom I hourly pray , prevent it not . and . I have be hinder by this wicked woman 's watch I so close , from writing on ; and so I will put both these day together . I have be a little turn with she for a airing , in the chariot , and walk several time in the garden ; but have always she at my heel . come to see we , and take a walk with we once ; and while she back be just turn , ( encourage by the hint he have before give I , ) I say , , I see two tile upon that parsley - bed ; might not one cover they with mould , with a note between they , on occasion ?-- a good hint , say he ; let that sunflower by the back - door of the garden be the place ; I have a key to the door ; for it be my nearest way to the town . so I be force to begin . of what invention will necessity push we upon ! I hug myself at the thought ; and she come to we , he say , as if he be continue a discourse we be in : no , not extraordinary pleasant . what be that ? what be that ? say .-- only , say he , the town , I be say , be not very pleasant . no , indeed , say she , it be not ; it be a poor town , to my thinking . be there any gentry in it ? say I . and so we chat on about the town , to deceive she . but my deceit intend no hurt to any body . we then talk of the garden , how large and pleasant , and the like ; and sit down on the tuft slope of the fine fish - pond , to see the fish play upon the surface of the water ; and she say , I should angle if I would . I wish , say I , you would be so kind to fetch I a rod and bait . pretty mistress ! say she -- I know better than that , I will assure you , at this time .-- I mean no harm , say I , indeed . let I tell you , say she . I know none who have they thought more about they than you . a body ought to look to it where you be . but we will angle a little to - morrow . , who be much afraid of she , turn the discourse to a general subject . I saunter in , and leave they to talk by themselves ; but he go away to town , and she be soon after I . I have get to my pen and ink ; and I say , I want some paper , , ( put what I be about in my bosom :) you know I have write two letter , and send they by . ( of how he name , poor guilty fellow , grieve I ! ) well , say she , you have some left ; one sheet do for those
those two letter . yes , say I ; but I use half another for a cover , you know ; and see how I have scribble the other half ; and so I shew she a parcel of broken scrap of verse , which I have try to recollect , and have write purposely that she might see , and think I usually employ to such idle purpose . ay , say she , so you have ; well , I will give you two sheet more ; but let I see how you dispose of they , either write or blank . well , think I , I hope still , , to be too hard for thee . now Argus , the poets say , have a hundred eye , and be set to watch with they all , as she do . she bring I the paper , and say , now , madam , let I see you write something . I will , say I ; and take the pen and write , 'i wish would be so good to I , as I would be to she , if I have it in my power .'-- that be pretty now , say she ; well , I hope I be ; but what then ? ' why then ( write I ) she would do I the favour to let I know , what I have do to be make she prisoner ; and what she think be to become of I . ' well , and what then ? say she . ' why then , of consequence , ( scribble I , ) she would let I see she instruction , that I may know how far to blame , or to acquit she . ' thus I fool on , to show she my fondness for scribbling ; for I have no expectation of any good from she ; that so she might suppose I employ myself , as I say , to no better purpose at other time : for she will have it , that I be upon some plot , I be so silent , and love so much to be by myself .-- she would have make I write on a little further . no , say I ; you have not answer I . why , say she , what can you doubt , when my master himself assure you of he honour ? ay , say I ; but lay you hand to you heart , , and tell I , if you yourself believe he . yes , say she , to be sure I do . but , say I , what do you call honou ? why , say she , what do he call honou , think you ?--Ruin ! shame ! disgrace ! say I , I fear .-- pho ! pho ! say she ; if you have any doubt about it , he can best explain he own meaning :-- I will send he word to come and satisfy you , if you will .-- Horrid creature ! say I , all in a fright -- can 'st thou not stab I to the heart ? I would rather thou would 'st , than say such another word ! -- but I hope there be no such thought of he come . she have the wickedness to say , no , no ; he do not intend to come , as I know of -- but if I be he , I would not be long away . what mean the woman ? say I .-- ! say she , ( turn it off ;) why I mean , I would come , if I be he , and put a end to all you fear -- by make you as happy as you wish . it be out of he power , say I , to make I happy , great and rich as he be ! but by leave I innocent , and give I liberty to go to my dear father and mother . she go away soon after , and I end my letter , in hope to have a opportunity to lay it in the appointed place . so I go to she , and say ; I suppose , as it be not dark , I may take another turn in the garden . it be too late , say she ; but if you will go , do not stay ; and , , see and attend madam , as she call I . so I go towards the pond , the maid follow I , and dropt purposely my hussy : and when I come near the tile , I say , . , I have dropt my hussy ; be so kind as to look for it ; I have it by the pond side . she go back to look , and I slipt the note between the tiles , and cover they as quick as I could with the light mould , quite unperceived ; and the maid find the hussy , I take it , and saunter in again , and meet come to see after I . what I write be this : ' REVEREND , ' the want of a opportunity to speak my mind to you , I be sure will excuse this boldness in a poor creature that be betrayed hither , I have reason to think , for the worst of purpose . you know something , to be sure , of my story , my native poverty , which I be not asham of , my late lady 's goodness , and my master 's design upon I . it be true he promise honour , and all that ; but the honour of the wicked be disgrace and shame
shame to the virtuous : and he may think he keep he promise , accord to the notion he may allow himself to hold ; and yet , accord to nine and every good body 's , basely ruin I . 'I be so wretch , and ill - treat by this , and she be so ill - principle a woman , that , as I may soon want the opportunity which the happy hint of this day affords to my hope , I throw myself at once upon you goodness , without the least reserve ; for I can not be worse than I be , should that fail I ; which , I dare say , to you power , it will not : for I see it , sir , in you look , I hope it from you cloth , and I doubt it not from you inclination , in a case circumstance as my unhappy one be . for , sir , in help I out of my present distress , you perform all the act of religion in one ; and the highest mercy and charity , both to the body and soul of a poor wretch , that , believe I , sir , have , at present , not so much as in thought swerve from she innocence . ' be there not some way to be find out for my escape , without danger to yourself ? be there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood , to whom I may fly , only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother ? be make acquainted with my sad story , by you convey a letter to she ? my poor parent be so low in the world , they can do nothing but break they heart for I ; and that , I fear , will be the end of it . ' my master promise , if I will be easy , as he call it , in my present lot , he will not come down without my consent . ! sir , this be nothing : for what be the promise of a person who think himself at liberty to act as he have do by I ? if he come , it must be to ruin I ; and come to be sure he will , when he think he have silence the clamour of my friend , and lull I , as no doubt he hope , into a fatal security . ' now , therefore , sir , be all the time I have to work and struggle for the preservation of my honesty . if I stay till he come , I be undone . you have a key to the back garden door ; I have great hope from that . study , good sir , and contrive for I . I will faithfully keep you secret . -- yet I should be loath to have you suffer for I ! I say no more , but commit this to the happy tile , in the bosom of that earth , where , I hope , my deliverance will take root , and bring forth such fruit , as may turn to my inexpressible joy , and you eternal reward , both here and hereafter : as shall ever pray , ' you oppress humble servant . ' . this complete a terrible week since my set out , as I hope to see you , my dear father and mother . of how different be my hope then , from what they be now ! yet who know what these happy tile may produce ! but I must tell you , first , how I have be beat by ! it be very true !-- and thus it come about : my impatience be great to walk in the garden , to see if any thing have offer , answerable to my hope . but this wick would not let I go without she ; and say , she be not at leisure . we have a great many word about it ; for I tell she , it be very hard I could not be trust to walk by myself in the garden for a little air , but must be dog and watch worse than a thief . she still plead she instruction , and say she be not to trust I out of she sight : and you have better , say she , be easy and content , I assure you ; for I have worse order than you have yet find . I remember , add she , you ask , if there be any gentry in the neighbourhood ? this make I suspect you want to get away to they , to tell you sad dismal story , as you call it . my heart be at my mouth ; for I fear , by that hint , she have see my letter under the tiles : of how uneasy I be ! at last she say , well , since you take on so , you may take a turn , and I will be with you in a minute . when I be out of sight of she window , I speed towards the hopeful place ; but be soon force to slacke my pace , by she odious voice : hey - day , why so nimble , and whither so fast ? say she : what ! be you upon a wager ? I stopt for she , till she pursy side be waddle up to I ; and she hold by my arm , half out of breath : so I be force to pass by the dear place , without da to look at it . the gardener be at work
work a little farther , and so we look upon he , and I begin to talk about he art ; but she say , softly , my instruction be , not to let you be so familiar with the servants . why , say I , be you afraid I should confederate with they to commit a robbery upon my master ? may be I be , say the odious wretch ; for to rob he of yourself , would be the worst that could happen to he , in he opinion . and pray , say I , walk on , how come I to be he property ? what right have he in I , but such as a thief may plead to steal goods ?-- why , be ever the like heard ? say she .-- this be downright rebellion , I protest !-- well , well , lambkin , ( which the foolish often call I , ) if I be in he place , he should not have he property in you long questionable . why , what would you do , say I , if you be he ?-- not stand shill - I - shall - I , as he do ; but put you and himself both out of you pain .-- why , , say I , ( I could not help it , ) would you ruin I by force ?-- Upon this she give I a deadly slap upon my shoulder : take that , say she ; whom do you call ? I be so surprised , ( for you never beat I , my dear father and mother , in you life , ) that I be like one thunder - struck ; and look round , as if I want somebody to help I ; but , alas ! I have nobody ; and say , at last , rub my shoulder , be this also in you instruction ? -- ! for I ! be I to be beaten too ? and so fall a crying , and throw myself upon the grass - walk we be upon . -- she , in a great pet , I will not be call such name , I will assure you . come up ! I see you have a spirit : you must and shall be keep under . I will manage such little provoke thing as you , I warrant ye ! come , come , we will go in ag door , and I will lock you up , and you shall have no shoe , nor any thing else , if this be the case . I do not know what to do . this be a cruel thing to I , and I blame myself for my free speech ; for now I have give she some pretence : and o ! think I , here I have , by my malapertness , ruin the only project I have leave . the gardener see this scene : but she call to he , well , , what do you stare at ? pray mind what you be upon . and away he walk , to another quarter , out of sight . well , think I , I must put on the dissembler a little , I see . she take my hand roughly ; come , get up , say she , and come in ag door !-- I will Jezebel you , I will so !-- why , dear , say I .-- none of you dear , and you coaxing ! say she ; why not again ?-- she be in a fearful passion , I see , and I be out of my wit . think I , I have often hear woman blame for they tongue ; I wish mine have be shorter . but I can not go in , say I , indeed I can not !-- why , say she , can not you ? I will warrant I can take such a thin body as you under my arm , and carry you in , if you will not walk . you do not know my strength . -- yes , but I do , say I , too well ; and will you not use I worse when I come in ? -- so I arise , and she mutter to herself all the way , she to be a with I , that have use I so well ! and such like . when I come near the house , I say , sit down upon a settle - bench , well , I will not go in , till you say you forgive I , Jewkes . -- if you will forgive my call you that name , I will forgive you beat I .-- she sit down by I , and see in a great pucker , and say , well , come , I will forgive you for this time : and so kiss I , as a mark of reconciliation . -- but pray , say I , tell I where I be to walk and go , and give I what liberty you can ; and when I know the most you can favour I with , you shall see I will be as content as I can , and not ask you for more . ay , say she , this be something like : I wish I could give you all the liberty you desire ; for you must think it be no pleasure to I to tie you to my petticoat , as it be , and not let you stir without I .-- but people that will do they duty , must have some trouble : and what I do , be to serve as good a master , to be sure
sure , as life . -- yes , say I , to every body but I ! he love you too well , to be sure , return she ; and that be the reason : so you ought to bear it . I say , love ! reply I . come , say she , do not let the wench see you have be cry , nor tell she any tale : for you will not tell they fairly , I be sure : and I will send she , and you shall take another walk in the garden , if you will : may be it will get you a stomach to you dinner : for you do not eat enough to keep life and soul together . you be beauty to the bone , add the strange wretch , or you could not look so well as you do , with so little stomach , so little rest , and so much pining and whin for nothing at all . well , think I , say what thou will , so I can be ry of thy bad tongue and company : and I hope to find some opportunity now to come at my sunflower . but I walk the other way , to take that in my return , to avoid suspicion . I force my discourse to the maid ; but it be all upon general thing ; for I find she be ask after every thing I say and do . when I come near the place , as I have be devise , I say , pray step to the gardener , and ask he to gather a sallad for I to dinner . she call out , ! say I , he can not hear you so far off ; and pray tell he , I should like a cucumber too , if he have one . when she have steep about a bow - shot from I , I popt down , and whipt my finger under the upper tile , and pull out a letter without direction , and thrust it in my bosom , trembl for joy . she be with I , before I could well secure it ; and I be in such a taking that I fear I should discover myself . you seem frightened , madam , say she ; why , say I , with a lucky thought , ( alas ! you poor daughter will make a intriguer by and by ; but I hope a innocent one ! ) I stoop to smell at the sunflower , and a great nasty worm run into the ground , that start I ; for I can not abide worm . say she , do not smell . so I find , reply I . and then we walk in ; and say ; well , you have make haste now . -- you shall go another time . I go up to my closet , lock myself in , and open my letter , find in it these word : 'I be infinitely concerned for you distress . I most heartily wish it may be in my power to serve and save so much innocence , beauty , and merit . my whole dependance be upon ----, and I have a near view of be provide for by he favour to I . but yet I would sooner forfeit all my hope in he , ( trust in for the rest , ) than not assist you , if possible . I never look upon ---- in the light he now appear in to I , in you case . to be sure , he be no professed debauchee . but I be entirely of opinion , you should , if possible , get out of he hand ; and especially as you be in very bad one in 's . ' we have here the widow , mistress of a good fortune ; and a woman of virtue , I believe . we have also old , and he lady , who be a good woman ; and they have two daughter , virtuous young lady . all the rest be but middle people , and trader , at best . I will try , if you please , either , or , if they will permit you to take refuge with they . I see no probability of keeping myself conceal in this matter ; but will , as I say , risk all thing to serve you ; for I never see a sweetness and innocence like yours ; and you hard case have attach I entirely to you ; for I know , as you so happily express , if I can serve you in this case , I shall thereby perform all the act of religion in one . ' as to , I will convey a letter , if you please , to she ; but it must not be from we post -house , I give you caution ; for the man owe all he bread to -- --, and he place too ; and I believe , by something that dropt from he , over a can of ale , have he instruction . you do not know how you be surround ; all which confirm I in you opinion , that no honour be mean you , let what will be profess ; and I be glad you want no caution on that head . ' give I leave to say , that I have hear much in you praise ; but , I think , greatly short of what you deserve , both as to person and mind : my eye convince I of the one , you letter of the other . for fear of lose the present lucky opportunity , I be longer
longer than otherwise I should be . but I will not enlarge , any further than to assure you that I be , to the best of my power , ' you faithful friend and servant , ' . ' 'I will come once every morning , and once every evening , after school - time , to look for you letter . I will come in , and return without go into the house , if I see the coast clear : otherwise , to avoid suspicion , I will come in . ' I instantly , in answer to this pleasing letter , write as follow : 'reverend , 'o how suited to you function , and you character , be you kind letter ! bless you for it ! I now think I be begin to be happy . I should be sorry to have you suffer on my account : but I hope it will be make up to you a hundr - fold , by that whom you so faithfully serve . I should be too happy , could I ever have it in my power to contribute in the least to it . but , alas ! to serve I , must be for 's sake only ; for I be poor and lowly in fortune ; though in mind , I hope , too high to do a mean or unworthy deed to gain a kingdom . but I lose time .---- ' any way you think best , I should be pleased with ; for I know not the person , nor in what manner it be best to apply to they . I be glad of the hind you so kindly give I of the man at the post-house . I be think of open a way for myself by letter , when I could have opportunity ; but I see more and more that I be , indeed , strangely surround with dangers ; and that there be no dependance to be make on my master 's honour . 'I should think , sir , if either of those ladie would give leave , I might some way get out by favour of you key : and as it be impossible , watch as I be , to know when it can be , suppose , sir , you get one make by it , and put it , the next opportunity , under the sunflower ?-- I be sure no time be to be lose , because it be rather my wonder , that she be not thoughtful about this key , than otherwise ; for she forget be not the minutest thing . but , sir , if I have this key , I could , if these lady would not shelter I , run away any where : and if I be once out of the house , they could have no pretence to force I again ; for I have do no harm , and hope to make my story good to any compassionate body ; and by this way you need not to be know . torture should not wr it from I , I assure you . ' one thing more , good sir . have you no correspondence with my master 's Bedfordshire family ? by that mean , may be , I could be inform of he intention of come hither , and when I enclose you a letter of a deceitful wretch ; for I can trust you with any thing ; poor . its contents will tell why I enclose it . perhaps by he mean , something may be discover ; for he seem willing to ato for he treachery to I , by the intimation of future service . I leave the hint to you to improve upon , and am , ' , ' you for ever oblige , and thankful servant . ' 'i hope , sir , by you favour , I could send a little packet , now and then , some how , to my poor father and mother . I have a little stock of money , about five or six guinea : shall I put half in you hand , to defray the charge of a man and horse , or any other incidents ? ' I have but just time to transcribe this , before I be call to dinner ; and I put that for , with a wafer in it , in my bosom , to get a opportunity to lay it in the dear place . of good sir , of all the flower in the garden , the sunflower , sure , be the loveliest !-- it be a propitious one to I ! how nobly my plot succeed ! but I begin to be afraid my writing may be discover ; for they grow large : I stitch they hithertoo in my under - coat , next my linen . but if this brute should search I -- I must try to please she , and then she will not . well , I be but just come off from a walk in the garden , and have deposit my letter by a simple wile . I get some horse - bean ; and we take a turn in the garden , to angle , as Jewkes have promise I . she bait the hook , and I hold it , and soon hook a lovely carp . play it , play it , say she : I do , and bring it to the bank . a sad thought just then come into my head ; and I take it , and throw it in again ; and of the pleasure it seem to have , to flounce in , when at liberty !-- why this ? say she . of ! say I ,
, I be think this poor carp be the unhappy . I be like you and myself to my naughty master . as we hook and deceive the poor carp , so be I betraye by false bait ; and when you say , play it , play it , it go to my heart , to think I should sport with the destruction of the poor fish I have betraye ; and I could not but fl it in again : and do you not see the joy with which the happy carp flounce from we ? o ! say I , may some good merciful body procure I my liberty in the same manner ; for to be sure , I think my danger equal ! bless thee ! say she , what a thought be there !-- well , I can angle no more , add I . I will try my fortune , say she , and take the rod . do , answer I ; and I will plant life , if I can , while you be destroy it . I have some horse - bean here , and will go and stick they in one of the border , to see how long they will be come up ; and I will call they my garden . so you see , dear father and mother , ( I hope now you will soon see ; for , may be , if I can not get away so soon myself , I may send my papers some how ; I say you will see , ) that this furnish I with a good excuse to look after my garden another time ; and if the mould should look a little freshish , it will not be so much suspect . she mistrust nothing of this ; and I go and stick in here and there my bean , for about the length of five ell , of each side of the sunflower ; and easily deposit my letter . and not a little proud be I of this contrivance . sure something will do at last ! , . I have just now tell you a trick of mine ; now I will tell you a trick of this wicked woman 's . she come up to I : say she , I have a bill I can not change till to - morrow ; and a tradesman want he money most sadly : and I do not love to turn poor trade - folk away without they money : have you any about you ? I have a little , reply I : how much will do ? oh ! say she , I want eight pound . ! say I , I have but between five and six . Lend I that , say she , till to - morrow . I do so ; and she go down stair : and when she come up , she laugh , and say , well , I have pay the tradesman . say I , I hope you will give it I again to - morrow . at that , the assurance , laugh loud , say , why , what occasion have you for money ? to tell you the truth , lambkin , I do not want it . I only fear you might make a bad use of it ; and now I can trust with you a little oftener , especially as I have get the key of you portmanteau ; so that you can neither corrupt she with money , nor fine thing . never do any body look more silly than I .--o how I fret , to be so foolishly outwit !-- and the more , as I have hint to , that I would put some in he hand to defray the charge of my sending to you . I cry for vexation . -- and now I have not five shilling leave to support I , if I can get away .-- be ever such a fool as I ! I must be pride myself in my contrivance , indeed ! say I . be this you instruction , wolfkin ? ( for she call I lambkin ) . , you mean , child ! say she .-- well , I now forgive you heartily ; let 's buss and be friend .-- out upon you say I ; I can not bear you !--but I durst not call she name again ; for I dread she huge paw most sadly . the more I think of this thing , the more do I regret it , and blame myself . this night the man from the post -hause bring a letter for , in which be one enclose for I : she bring it I up . say she , well , my good master do not forget we . he have send you a letter : and see what he write to I . so she read , that he hope she fair charge be well , happy , and contente . ay , to be sure , say I , I can not choose -- that he do not doubt she care and kindness to I : that I be very dear to he , and she could not use I too well ; and the like . there be a master for you ! say she : sure you will love and pray for he . I desire she to read the rest . no , no , say she , but I will not . say I , be there any order for take my shoe away , and for beat I ? no , say she , nor about . well , return I , I cry truce ; for I have no mind to be beat again .
. I think , say she , we have forgiven one another . my letter be as follow : , 'I begin to repent already , that I have bound myself , by promise , not to see you till you give I leave ; for I think the time very tedious . can you place so much confidence in I , as to invite I down ? assure yourself , that you generosity shall not be throw away upon I . I the rather would press this , as I be uneasy for you uneasiness ; for acquaint I , that you take you restraint very heavily ; and neither eat , drink , nor rest well ; and I have too great interest in you health , not to wish to shorten the time of this trial ; which will be the consequence of my come down to you . , too , have intimate to I you concern , with a grief that hardly give he leave for utterance ; a grief that a little alarme my tenderness for you . not that I fear any thing , but that you disregard to I , which yet my proud heart will hardly permit I to own , may throw you upon some rashness , that might encourage a daring hope : but how poorly do I descend , to be anxious about such a menial as he !-- I will only say one thing , that if you will give I leave to attend you at the hall , ( consider who it be that request this from you as a favour , ) I solemnly declare , that you shall have cause to be pleased with this obliging mark of you confidence in I , and consideration for I ; and if I find have not behave to you with the respect due to one I so dearly love , I will put it entirely into you power to discharge she the house , if you think proper ; and , or who else you please , shall attend you in she place . this I say on a hint give I , as if you resent something from that quarter . , answer favourably this earnest request of one that can not live without you , and on whose honour to you , you may absolutely depend ; and so much the more , as you place a confidence in it . I be , and assuredly ever will be , ' you faithful and affectionate , etc . ' ' you will be glad , I know , to hear you father and mother be well , and easy upon you last letter . that give I a pleasure that I be resolve you shall not repent . Jewkes will convey to I you answer . ' I but slightly read this letter for the present , to give way to one I have hope of find by this time from . I take a evening turn , as I call it , in 's company : and walk by the place , I say , do you think , Jewkes , any of my bean can have struck since yesterday ? she laugh , and say , you be a poor gardener : but I love to see you divert yourself . she pass on , I find my good friend have provide for I ; and , slipp it in my bosom , ( for she back be towards I , ) here , say I , ( have a bean in my hand , ) be one of they ; but it have not stir . no , to be sure , say she , and turn upon I a most wicked jest , unbecom the mouth of a woman , about planting , etc . when I come in , I hy to my closet , and read as follow : 'I be sorry to tell you that I have have a repulse from . she be concerned at you case , she say , but do not care to make herself enemy . I apply to , and tell she in the most pathetic manner I could , you sad story , and shew she you more pathetic letter . I find she well dispose , but she would advise with , who by the by be not a man of a extraordinary character for virtue ; but he say to he lady in my presence , ' why , what be all this , my dear , but that we neighbour have a mind to he mother 's waiting - maid ! and if he take care she want for nothing , I do not see any great injury will be do she . he hurt no family by this :' ( so , my dear father and mother , it seem that poor people 's honesty be to go for nothing ) ' and I think , , you , of all man , should not engage in this affair , against you friend and patron . ' he speak this in so determine a manner , that the lady have do ; and I have only to beg no notice should be take of the matter as from I . 'I have hint you case to , the minister of this parish ; but I be concerned to say , that he impute selfish view to I , as if I would make a interest in you affections by my zeal . and when I represent the duty of we function , and the like , and protest my disinterestedness , he coldly say , I be very good ; but be a young man , and know little of the world . and though it be a thing to be lament , yet when he and
and I should set about to reform mankind in this respect , we should have enough upon we hand ; for , he say , it be too common and fashionable a case to be withstand by a private clergyman or two : and then he utter some reflection upon the conduct of the present fathers of the church , in regard to the first personage of the realm , as a justification of he coldness on this score . 'I represent the different circumstance of you affair ; that other woman liv evilly by they own consent , but to serve you , be to save a innocence that have but few example ; and then I shew he you letter . ' he say it be prettily write : and he be sorry for you ; and that you good intentions ought to be encourage : but what , say he , would you have I do , ? why suppose , sir , say I , you give she shelter in you house , with you spouse and niece , till she can get to she friend . -- what ! and embroil myself with a man of ---- 's power and fortune ! no , not I , I will assure you !-- and I would have you consider what you be about . besides , she own , continue he , that he promise to do honourably by she ; and she shyness will procure she good tern enough ; for he be no covetous nor wick gentleman , except in this case ; and ' ti what all young gentleman will do . 'I be greatly concerned for he , I assure you : but I be not discourage by this ill success , let what will come of it , if I can serve you . 'I do not hear , as yet , that ---- be come . I be glad of you hint as to that unhappy fellow . something , perhaps , will strike out from that , which may be useful . as to you packet , if you seal they up , and lay they in the usual place , if you find it not suspect , I will watch a opportunity to convey they ; but if they be large , you have best be very cautious . this evil woman , I find , mistrust I much . ' I just hear , that the gentleman be die , whose live ---- have promise I . I have almost a scruple to take it , as I be act so contrary to he desire : but I hope he will one day thank I for it . as to money , do not think of it at present . be assure you may command all in my power to do for you without reserve . 'I believe , when we hear he be come , it will be best to make use of the key , which I shall soon procure you ; and I can borrow a horse for you , I believe , to wait within half a mile of the back - door , over the pasture ; and will contrive , by myself , or somebody , to have you conduct some mile distant , to one of the villag thereabout ; so do not be discomfort , I beseech you . I be , excellent , ' you faithful friend , etc. ' I make a thousand sad reflection upon the former part of this honest gentleman 's kind letter ; and but for the hope he give I at last , should have give up my case as quite desperate . I then write to thank he most gratefully for he kind endeavours ; to lament the little concern the gentry have for my deplorable case ; the wickedness of the world , first to give way to such iniquitous fashions , and then plead the frequency of they , against the attempt to amend they ; and how unaffected people be with the distress of other . I recall my former hint as to write to , which I fear , I say , would only serve to apprise she brother , that she know he wicked scheme , and more harden he in it , and make he come down the sooner , and to be the more determined on my ruin ; besides that it might make guess at , as a means of convey my letter : and be very fearful , that if that good lady would interest herself in my behalf , ( which be a doubt , because she both love and fear she brother , ) it would have no effect upon he ; and that therefore I would wait the happy event I might hope for from he kind assistance in the key , and the horse . I intimate my master 's letter , beg to be permit to come down : be fearful it might be sudden ; and that I be of opinion no time be to be lose ; for we might let slip all we opportunity ; tell he the money trick of this vile woman , etc . I have not time to take a copy of this letter , I be so watch . and when I have it ready in my bosom , I be easy . and so I go to seek out , and tell she , I would have she advice upon the letter I have receive from my master ; which point of confidence in she please she not a little . ay , say she , now this be something like : and we will take a turn in the garden , or where you please . I pretend it be indifferent to I ; and so we walk
walk into the garden . I begin to talk to she of the letter ; but be far from acquaint she with all the contents ; only that he want my consent to come down , and hope she use I kindly , and the like . and I say , now , , let I have you advice as to this . why then , say she , I will give it you freely ; send to he to come down . it will highly oblige he , and I dare say you will fare the better for it . how the better ? say I .-- I dare say , you think yourself , that he intend my ruin . I hate , say she , that foolish word , you ruin !-- why , ne 'er a lady in the land may live happier than you if you will , or be more honourably use . well , , say I , I shall not , at this time , dispute with you about the word ruin and honourable : for I find we have quite different notion of both : but now I will speak plainer than ever I do . do you think he intend to make proposal to I as to a keep mistress , or keep slave rather , or do you not ?-- why , lambkin , say she , what dost thou think thyself ?-- I fear , say I , he do . well , say she , but if he do , ( for I know nothing of the matter , I assure you , ) you may have you own term -- I see that ; for you may do any thing with he . I could not bear this to be speak , though it be all I fear of a long time ; and begin to exclbe be most sadly . , say she , he may marry you , as far as I know .-- no , no , say I , that can not be .-- I neither desire nor expect it . he condition do not permit I to have such a thought ; and that , and the whole series of he conduct , convince I of the contrary ; and you would have I invite he to come down , would you ? be not this to invite my ruin ? ' Tis what I would do , say she , in you place ; and if it be to be as you think , I should rather be out of my pain , than live in continual fright and apprehension , as you do . no , reply I , a hour of innocence be worth a age of guilt ; and be my life to be make ever so miserable by it , I should never forgive myself , if I be not to lengthen out to the longest minute my happy time of honesty . who know what may do for I ! why , may be , say she , as he love you so well , you may prevail upon he by you prayer and tear ; and for that reason , I should think , you would better let he come down . well , say I , I will write he a letter , because he expect a answer , or may be he will make a pretence to come down . how can it go ? I will take care of that , say she ; it be in my instruction .-- ay , think I , so I doubt , by the hint give I about the post-house . the gardener come by , I say , , I have plan a few bean , and I call the place my garden . it be just by the door out yonder : I will show it you ; pray do not dig they up . so I go on with he ; and when we have turn the alley , out of she sight and be near the place say I , pray step to , and ask she if she have any more bean for I to plant ? he smile , I suppose at my foolishness ; and I pop the letter under the mould , and step back , as if wait for he return ; which , be near , be immediate ; and she follow he . what should I do with bean ? say she , -- and sadly scare I ; for she whisper I , I be afraid of some fetch ! you do not use to send on such simple errand .-- what fetch ? say I : it be hard I can neither stir , nor speak , but I must be suspect .-- why , say she , my master write , that I must have all my eye about I ; for though you be as innocent as a dove , yet you be as cunning as a serpent . but I will forgive you , if you cheat I . then I think of my money , and could have call she name , have I da : and I say , , now you talk of forgive I , if I cheat you , be so kind as to pay I my money ; for though I have no occasion for it , yet I know you be but in jest , and intend to give it I again . you shall have it in a proper time , say she ; but , indeed , I be in earnest to get it out of you hand , for fear you should make a ill use of it . and so we cavill upon this subject as we walk in , and I go up to write my letter
letter to my master ; and , as I intend to show it she , I resolve to write accordingly as to she part of it ; for I make little account of he offer of to I , instead of this wicked woman , ( though the most agreeable thing that could have befall I , except my escape from hence , ) nor indeed any thing he say . for to be honourable , in the just sense of the word , he need not have cause I to be run away with , and confin as I be . I write as follow : ' , ' when I consider how easily you might make I happy , since all I desire be to be permit to go to my poor father and mother ; when I reflect upon you former proposal to I in relation to a certain person , not one word of which be now mention ; and upon my be in that strange manner run away with , and still keep here a miserable prisoner ; do you think , sir , ( pardon you poor servant 's freedom ; my fear make I bold ; do you think , I say , ) that you general assurance of honour to I , can have the effect upon I , that , be it not for these thing , all you word ought to have ?--o , good sir ! I too much apprehend that you notion of honour and mine be very different from one another : and I have no other hope but in you continue absence . if you have any proposal to make I , that be consistent with you honourable profession , in my humble sense of the word , a few line will communicate they to I , and I will return such a answer as befit I . but , oh ! what proposal can one in you high station have to make to one in my low one ! I know what belong to you degree too well , to imagine , that any thing can be expect but sad temptation , and utter distress , if you come down ; and you know not , sir , when I be make desperate , what the wretch dare to do ! ' whatever rashness you may impute to I , I can not help it ; but I wish I may not be force upon any , that otherwise would never enter into my thought . forgive I , sir , my plainness ; I should be loath to behave to my master unbecomingly ; but I must need say , sir , my innocence be so dear to I , that all other consideration be , and , I hope , shall ever be , treat by I as nicety , that ought , for that , to be dispense with . if you mean honourably , why , sir , should you not let I know it plainly ? why be it necessary to imprison I , to convince I of it ? and why must I be close watch , and attend , hinder from stirr out , from speak to any body , from go so much as to church to pray for you , who have be , till of late , so generous a benefactor to I ? why , sir , I humbly ask , why all this , if you mean honourably ?-- it be not for I to expostulate so freely , but in a case so near to I , with you , sir , so greatly my superior . pardon I , I hope you will ; but as to see you , I can not bear the dreadful apprehension . whatever you have to propose , whatever you intend by I , let my assent be that of a free person , mean as I be , and not of a sordid slave , who be to be threaten and frighten into a compliance with measure , which you conduct to she seem to imply would be otherwise abhor by she .-- my restraint be indeed hard upon I : I be very uneasy under it . shorten it , I beseech you , or -- but I will not dare to say more , than that I be ' you greatly oppress unhappy servant . ' after I have take a copy of this , I fold it up ; and , come just as I have do , sit down by I ; and say , when she see I direct it , I wish you would tell I if you have take my advice , and consent to my master 's come down . if it will oblige you , say I , I will read it to you . that be good , say she ; then I will love you dearly .-- say I , then you must not offer to alter one word . I will not , reply she . so I read it to she , and she praise I much for my word it ; but say she think I push the matter very close ; and it would better bear talk of , than write about . she want a explanation or two , as about the proposal to a certain person ; but I say , she must take it as she hear it . well , well , say she , I make no doubt you understand one another , and will do so more and more . I seal up the letter , and she undertake to convey it . . for my part , I know it in vain to expect to have leave to go to church now , and so I do not ask ; and I be
be the more indifferent , because , if I might have have permission , the sight of the neighbouring gentry , who have despise my suffering , would have give I great regret and sorrow ; and it be impossible I should have edify under any doctrine preach by : so I apply myself to my private devotion . come yesterday , and this day , as usual , and take my letter ; but , have no good opportunity , we avoid one another 's conversation , and keep at a distance : but I be concerned I have not the key ; for I would not have lose a moment in that case , have I be he , and he I . when I be at my devotion , come up , and want I sadly to s she a psalm , as she have often on common day importune I for a song upon the spinnet : but I decline it , because my spirit be so low I could hardly speak , nor car to be speak to ; but when she be go , I remember the cxxxviith psalm to be a little touching , turn to it , and take the liberty to alter it , somewhat nearer to my case . I hope I do not sin in it ; but thus I turn it : I . when sad I sit in ---- and hall , all guard round about , and think of ev'ry absent friend , the tear for grief burst out . ii . my joy and hope all overthrown , my heart - string almost break , Unfin my mind for melody , much more to bear a joke . iii . then she to whom I pris'ner be , say to I , tauntingly , now cheer you heart , and s a song and tune you mind to joy . iv . ! say I , how can I frame my heavy heart to se , or tune my mind , while thus enthrall would by such a wicked thing ! . but yet , if from my innocence I , ev'n in thought , should slide , then let my finger quite forget the sweet spinnet to guide . . and let my tongue within my mouth be lock have for ever fast , if I rejoice , before I see my full deliv'rance past . Vii . and thou , , recompense the evil I endure , from those who seek my sad disgrace , so causeless , to procure . . remember , , this , when , with a mighty sound , she cry , down with she chastity , down to the very ground ! IX . Ev'n so shal thou , o wick one ! at length to shame be bring , and happy shall all those be call ' that my deliv'rance wrotch . . yea , bless shall the man be call that shame thee of thy evil , and save I from thy vile attempt , and thee , too , from the d --- l . , , . I write now with a little more liking , though less opportunity , because have get a large parcel of my papers , safe in he hand , to send they to you , as he have opportunity ; so I be not quite uselessly employ : and I be deliver besides , from the fear of they be find , if I should be search , or discover . I have be permit to take a airing , five or six mile , with : but , though I know not the reason , she watch I more closely than ever ; so that we have discontinue , by consent , for these three day , the sunflower correspondence . the poor cook -maid have have a bad mischance ; for she have be hurt much by a bull in the pasture , by the side of the garden , not far from the back - door . now this pasture I be to cross , which be about half a mile , and then be a common , and near that a private horse - road , where I hope to find a opportunity for escaping , as soon as can get I a horse , and have make all ready for I : for he have get I the key , which he put under the mould , just by the door , as he find a opportunity to hind to I . he just now have signify , that the gentleman be dead , whose liive he have have hope of ; and he come pretendedly to tell of it ; and so could speak this to she before I . she wish he joy . see what the world be ! one man 's death be another man 's joy . thus we thrust out one another !-- my hard case make I serious . he find means to slide a letter into my hand , and be go away : he look at I with such respect and solemness at parting , that say , why , madam , I believe we young parson be half in love with you .-- ah ! , say I , he know better . say she , ( I believe to sound I , ) why , I can not see you can either of you do better ; and I have lately be so touch for you , see how heavily you apprehend dishonour from my master , that I think it be pity you should not have . I know this must be a fetch of hers ; because , instead of be trouble for I , as she pretend , she watch I closer , and he too : and so
so I say , there be not the man live that I desire to marry . if I can but keep myself honest , it be all my desire : and to be a comfort and assistance to my poor parent , if it should be my happy lot to be so , be the very top of my ambition . well , but , say she , I have be think very seriously , that would make you a good husband ; and as he will owe all he fortune to my master , he will be very glad , to be sure , to be oblige to he for a wife of he choose : especially , say she , such a pretty one , and one so ingenious , and genteelly educate . this give I a doubt , whether she know of my master 's intimation of that sort formerly ; and I ask she , if she have reason to surmise that that be in view ? no , she say ; it be only she own thought ; but it be very likely that my master have either that in view , or something better for I . but , if I approve of it , she would propose such a thing to she master directly ; and give a detestable hint , that I might take resolution upon it , of bring such a affair to effect . I tell she I abhor she vile insinuation ; and as to , I think he a civil good sort of man ; but , as on one side , he be above I ; so , on the other , I say of all thing I do not love a parson . so , find she could make nothing of I , she quit the subject . I will open he letter by and by , and give you the contents of it ; for she be up and down so much , that I be afraid of she surprise I . well , I see have not abandon I : I shall be under no necessity to make advance to , if I be ( as I be sure I be not ) dispose to it . this be he letter : 'I know not how to express myself , lest I should appear to you to have a selfish view in the service I would do you . but I really know but one effectual and honourable way to disengage yourself from the dangerous situation you be in . it be that of marriage with some person that you could make happy in you approbation . as for my own part , it would be , as thing stand , my apparent ruin ; and , worse still , I should involve you in misery too . but , yet , so great be my veneration for you , and so entire my reliance on , upon so just a occasion , that I should think myself but too happy , if I might be accept . I would , in this case , forego all my expectation , and be you conductor to some safe distance . but why do I say , in this case ? that I will do , whether you think fit to reward I so eminently or not : and I will , the moment I hear of ---- 's set out , ( and I think now I have settle a very good method of intelligence of all he motion , ) get a horse ready , and myself to conduct you . I refer myself wholly to you goodness and direction ; and am , with the highest respect , ' you most faithful humble servant . ' ' do not think this a sudden resolution . I always admire you hear - say character ; and the moment I see you , wish to serve so much excellence . ' what shall I say , my dear father and mother , to this unexpected declaration ? I want , now , more than ever , you blessing and direction . but , after all , I have no mind to marry ; I have rather live with you . but yet , I would marry a man who beg from door to door , and have no home nor being , rather than endanger my honesty . yet I cannot , methinks , hear of be a wife .-- after a thousand different thought , I write as follow : 'REVEREND , 'I be greatly confused at the contents of you last . you be much too generous , and I can not bear you should risk all you future prospects for so unworthy a creature . I can not think of you offer without equal concern and gratitude : for nothing , but to avoid my utter ruin , can make I think of a change of condition ; and so , sir , you ought not to accept of such a involuntary compliance , as mine would be , be I , upon the last necessity , to yield to you very generous proposal . I will rely wholly upon you goodness to I , in assist my escape ; but shall not , on you account principally , think of the honour you propose for I at present ; and never , but at the pleasure of my parent ; who , poor as they be , in such a weighty point , be as much entitle to my obedience and duty , as if they be ever so rich . I beg you , therefore , sir , not to think of any thing from I , but everlast gratitude , which shall always bind I to be ' you must oblige servant . ' , , , the 14th
14th , 15th , and , of my bondage . have receive a letter , and be much civiller to I , and too , than she use to be . I wonder I have not one in answer to mine to my master . I suppose I put the matter too home to he : and he be angry . I be not the more pleased with she civility ; for she be horrid cunning , and be not a whit less watchful . I lay a trap to get at she instruction , which she carry in the bosom of she stay ; but it have not succeed . my last letter be come safe to by the old conveyance , so that he be not suspect . he have intimate , that though I have not come so readily as he hope into he scheme , yet he diligence shall not be slacken , and he will leave it to and himself to dispose of he as he shall be find to deserve . he have signify to I , that he shall soon send a special messenger with the packet to you , and I have add to it what have occur since . . I be just now quite astonish !-- I hope all be right !-- but I have a strange turn to acquaint you with . and come to I both together ; he in ecstacy , she with a strange fluttering sort of air . well , say she , , I give you joy ! I give you joy !-- let nobody speak but I ! then she sit down , as out of breath , puffing and blowing . why , every thing turn as I say it would ! say she : why , there be to be a match between you and ! well , I always think it . never be so good a master ! -- go to , go to , naughty , mistrustful ; nay , , say the forward creature , I may as good call you : you ought on you knee to beg he pardon a thousand time for mistrust he . she be go on ; but I say , do not torture I thus , I beseech you , . let I know all !-- ah ! , say I , take care , take care !-- again ! say she : why , , show she you letter , and I will show she mine : they be bring by the same hand . I tremble at the thought of what this might mean ; and say , you have so surprise I , that I can not stand , nor hear , nor read ! why do you come up in such a manner to attack such weak spirit ? say he , to , shall we leave we letter with , and let she recover from she surprise ? ay , say she , with all my heart ; here be nothing but flam honour and good will ! and so say , they leave I they letter and withdrew . my heart be quite sick with the surprise , so that I could not presently read they , notwithstand my impatience ; but , after a while , recovere , I find the contents thus strange and unexpected : . , ' the death of have now give I the opportunity I have long want , to make you happy , and that in a double respect : for I shall soon put you in possession of he living ; and , if you have the art of make yourself well receive , of one of the loveliest wives in . she have not be use ( as she have reason to think ) accord to she merit ; but when she find herself under the protection of a man of virtue and probity , and a happy competency to support life in the manner to which she have be of late year accustom , I be persuade she will forgive those seem hardship which have pave the way to so happy a lot , as I hope it will be to you both . I have only to account for and excuse the odd conduct I have be guilty of , which I shall do when I see you : but as I shall soon set out for , I believe it will not be yet this month . mean time , if you can prevail with , you need not suspend for that you mutual happiness ; only let I have notice of it first , and that she approve of it ; which ought to be , in so material a point , entirely at she option ; as I assure you , on the other hand , I would have it at yours , that nothing may be want to complete you happiness . 'I be you humble servant . ' be ever the like heard ?-- lie still , my throbb heart , divide as thou art , between thy hope and thy fear ! -- but this be the letter leave with I : ' . Jewkes , ' you have be very careful and diligent in the task , which , for reason I shall hereafter explain , I have impos upon you . you trouble be now almost at a end ; for I have write my intentions to so particularly , that I need say the less here , because he will not scruple , I believe , to let you know the contents of my letter . I have only one thing to mention , that if you find what I have hint to he in the least measure disagreeable to either , you assure they both , that they be at entire liberty to pursue
pursue they own inclination . I hope you continue you civility to the mistrustful , uneasy , who now will begin to think better of hers and ' you friend , etc. ' I have hardly time to transcribe these letter , though , write so much , I write pretty fast , before they both come up again in high spirit ; and say , I be glad at my heart , madam , that I be beforehand in my declaration to you : this generous letter have make I the happiest man on earth ; and , Jewkes , you may be sure , that if I can procure this fair one 's consent , I shall think myself -- I interrupt the good man , and say , ah ! , take care , take care ; do not let -- there I stopt ; and say , Still mistrustful !-- I never see the like in my life ! -- but I see , say she , I be not wrong , while my old order last , to be wary of you both -- I should have have a hard task to prevent you , I find ; for , as the say be , can restrain consent of twain . I doubt not she take hold of he joyful indiscretion .-- I take she letter , and say , here , , be yours ; I thank you for it ; but I have be so long in a maze , that I can say nothing of this for the present . time will bring all to light . -- , say I , here be yours : may every thing turn to you happiness ! I give you joy of my master 's goodness in the living .-- it will be die , say he , not a living , without you .--Forbear , sir , say I ; while I have a father and mother , I be not my own mistress , poor as they be ; and I will see myself quite at liberty , before I shall think myself fit to make a choice . Jewkes hold up she eye and hand , and say , art , such caution , such cunning , for thy year !-- well !-- why , say I , ( that he might be more on he guard , though I hope there can not be deceit in this ; ' twould be strange villany , and that be a hard word , if there should ! ) I have be so use to be make a fool of by fortune , that I hardly can tell how to govern myself ; and be almost a infidel as to mankind . but I hope I may be wrong ; henceforth , Jewkes , you shall regulate my opinion as you please , and I will consult you in every thing --( that I think proper , say I to myself ) -- for , to be sure , though I may forgive she , I can never love she . she leave and I , a few minute , together ; and I say , consider , sir , consider what you have do . ' tTis impossible , say he , there can be deceit . I hope so , say I ; but what necessity be there for you to talk of you former declaration ? let this be as it will , that could do no good , especially before this woman . forgive I , sir ; they talk of woman 's promptness of speech ; but , indeed , I see a honest heart be not always to be trust with itself in bad company . he be go to reply , but though she task be say to be almost ( I take notice of that word ) at a end , she come up to we again , and say ; well , I have a good mind to show you the way to church to - morrow . I be glad of this , because , though in my present doubtful situation I should not have choose it , yet I would have encourage she proposal , to be able to judge by she be in earnest or otherwise , whether one might depend upon the rest . but again indiscreetly help she to a excuse , by say , that it be now best to defer it one , and till matter be riper for my appearance : and she readily take hold of it , and confirm he opinion . after all , I hope the best : but if this should turn out to be a plot , I fear nothing but a miracle can save I . but , sure the heart of man be not capable of such black deceit . besides , have it under he own hand , and he dare not but be in earnest : and then again , though to be sure he have be very wrong to I , yet he education , and parent ' example , have neither of they teach he such very black contrivance . so I will hope for the best . , , and I , have be all three walk together in the garden ; and she pull out she key , and we walk a little in the pasture to look at the bull , a ugly , grim , surly creature , that hurt the poor cook -may ; who be get pretty well again . point at the sunflower , but I be force to be very reserve to he ; for the poor gentleman have no guard , no caution at all . we have just sup together , all three : and I can not yet think that all must be right .--
.-- only I be resolve not to marry , if I can help it ; and I will give no encouragement , I be resolve , at least , till I be with you . say , before , he would send a messenger with a letter to my father and mother .-- I think the man have no discretion in the world : but l desire you will send no answer , till I have the pleasure and happiness which now I hope for soon , of see you . he will , in send my packet , send a most tedious parcel of stuff , of my oppression , my distress , my fear ; and so I will send this with it ; ( for give I leave to send a letter to my father , which look well ; ) and I be glad I can conclude , after all my suffering , with my hope , to be soon with you , which I know will give you comfort ; and so I rest , begge the continuance of you prayer and blessing , you ever dutiful DAUGHTER. my and , I have so much time upon my hand that I must write on , to employ myself . the evening , where I leave off , ask I , if I choose to be by myself ; I say , yes , with all my heart , if she please . well , say she , after to - night you shall . I ask she for more paper ; and she give I a bottle of ink , eight sheet of paper , which she say be all she store , ( for now she would get I to write for she to we master , if she have occasion , ) and six pens , with a piece of sealing wax . this look mighty well . she press I , when she come to bed , very much , to give encouragement to , and say many thing in he behalf ; and blame my shyness to he . I tell she , I be resolve to give no encouragement , till I have talk to my father and mother . she say , he fancie I think of somebody else , or I could never be so insensible . I assure she , as I could do very safely , that there be not a man on earth I wish to have : and as to , he might do better by far : and I have propose so much happiness in living with my poor father and mother , that I could not think of any scheme of life with pleasure , till I have try that . I ask she for my money ; and she say , it be above in she strong box , but that I should have it to - morrow . all these thing look well , as I say . Williams would go home this night , though late , because he would despatch a messenger to you with a letter he have propose from himself , and my packet . but pray do not encourage he , as I say ; for he be much too heady and precipitate as to this matter , in my way of think ; though , to be sure , he be a very good man , and I be much oblige to he . morning . - a - day ! we have bad news from poor . he have have a sad mischance ; fall among rogue in he way home last night : but by good chance have save my papers . this be the account he give of it to Jewkes : ' good Mr . Jewkes , 'I have have a sore misfortune in go from you . when I have get as near the town as the dam , and be go to cross the wooden bridge , two fellow get hold of I , and swore bitterly they would kill I , if I do not give they what I have . they rummage my pocket , and take from I my snuff - box , my seal - ring , and half a guinea , and some silver , and halfpence ; also my handkerchief , and two or three letter I have in my pocket . by good fortune , the letter give I be in my bosom , and so that escape but they bruise my head and face , and curse I for have no more money , tip I into the dam , cry , be there , parson , till to - morrow ! my shin and knee be bruise much in the fall against one of the stump ; and I have like to have be suffocate in water and mud . to be sure , I sha not be able to stir out this day or two : for I be a frightful spectacle ! my hat and wig I be force to leave behind I , and go home , a mile and a half , without ; but they be find next morning , and bring I , with my snuff - box , which the rogue must have drop . my cassock be sadly tear , as be my band . to be sure , I be much frightened , for a robbery in these parts have not be know many year . diligent search be make after the rogue . my humble respects to good : if she pity my misfortune , I shall be the sooner well , and fit to wait on she and you . this do not hinder I in write a letter , though with great pain , as I do this , ( to be sure this good man can keep
keep no secret ! ) and send it away by a man and horse , this morning . I be , good , ' you must oblige humble servant . ' ' be praise it be no worse ! and I find I have get no cold , though miserably wet from top to toe . my fright , I believe , prevent I from catching cold : for I be not rightly myself for some hour , and know not how I get home . I will write a letter of thanks this night , if I be able , to my kind patron , for he inestimable goodness to I . I wish I be enable to say all I hope , with regard to the better part of he bounty to I , incomparable . ' the wicked brute fall a laughing , when she have read this letter , till she fat side shook . say she , I can but think how the poor parson look , after part with he pretty mistress in such high spirit , when he find himself at the bottom of the dam ! and what a figure he must cut in he tattered band and cassock , and without a hat and wig , when he get home . I warrant , add she , he be in a sweet pickle !-- I say , I think it be very barbarous to laugh at such a misfortune ; but she reply , as he be safe , she laugh ; otherwise she would have be sorry : and she be glad to see I so concerned for he -- it look promising , she say . I heede not she reflection ; but as I have be use to cause for mistrust , I can not help say , that I do not like this thing : and they take he letter most alarm I .-- how happy it be they miss my packet ! I know not what to think of it ! -- but why should I let every accident break my peace ? yet it will do so , while I stay here . be mightily at I , to go with she in the chariot , to visit . she be so officious to bring on the affair between we , that , be a cunning , artful woman , I know not what to make of it : I have refuse she absolutely ; urging , that except I intend to encourage he suit , I ought not to do it . and she be go without I . I have strange temptation to get away in she absence , for all these fine appearance . ' tTis sad to have nobody to advise with !-- I know not what to do . but , alas for I ! I have no money , if I should , to buy any body 's civility , or to pay for necessaries or lodging . but I will go into the garden , and resolve afterwards ---- I have be in the garden , and to the back - door : and there I stand , my heart up at my mouth . I could not see I be watch ; so this look well . but if any thing should go bad afterwards , I should never forgive myself , for not take this opportunity . well , I will go down again , and see if all be clear , and how it look out at the back - door in the pasture . to be sure , there be witchcraft in this house ; and I believe be bribe , as well as all about I , and be get into the shape of that nasty grim bull to watch I !-- for I have be again , and venture to open the door , and go out about a bow - shot into the pasture ; but there stand that horrid bull , stare I full in the face , with fiery saucer eye , as I think . so I get in again , for fear he should come at I . nobody see I , however .-- do you think there be such thing as witch and spirit ? if there be , I believe , in my heart , have get this bull of she side . but yet , what could I do without money , or a friend ' -- of this wicked woman ! to trick I so ! every thing , man , woman , and , be in a plot against you poor Pamela , I think !-- then I know not one step of the way , nor how far to any house or cottage ; and whether I could gain protection , if I get to a house : and now the robber be abroad too , I may run into as great danger as I want to escape ; nay , greater much , if these promise appearance hold : and sure my master can not be so black as that they should not !-- what can I do ?-- I have a good mind to try for it once more ; but then I may be pursue and take : and it will be worse for I ; and this wicked woman will beat I , and take my shoe away , and lock I up . but , after all , if my master should mean well , he can not be angry at my fear , if I should escape ; and nobody can blame I ; and I can more easily be induce , with you , when all my apprehension be over , to consider he proposal of , than I could here ; and he pretend , as you have read in he letter , he
he will leave I to my choice : why then should I be afraid ? I will go down again , I think ! but yet my heart misgive I , because of the difficulty before I , in escaping ; and be so poor and so friendless !-- of good ! the preserver of the innocent ! direct I what to do ! well , I have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon I , that I ought to try to get way , and leave the issue to . so , once more -- I will see , at least , if this bull be still there . - a - day ! what a fate be this ! I have not the courage to go , neither can I think to stay . but I must resolve . the gardener be in sight last time ; so make I come up again . but I will contrive to send he out of the way , if I can :-- for if I never should have such another opportunity , I could not forgive myself . once more I will venture . God direct my footstep , and make smooth my path and my way to safety ! well , here I be , come back again ! frightene , like a fool , out of all my purpose ! of how terrible every thing appear to I ! I have get twice as far again , as I be before , out of the back - door : and I look and see the bull , as I think , between I and the door ; and another bull come towards I the other way : well , think I , here be double witchcraft , to be sure ! here be the spirit of my master in one bull , and 's in the other . and now I be go , to be sure ! of help ! cry I , like a fool , and run back to the door , as swift as if I fly . when I have get the door in my hand , I venture to look back , to see if these suppose bull be come ; and I see they be only two poor cow , a grazing in distant place , that my fear have make all this rout about . but as every thing be so frightful to I , I find I be not fit to think of my escape : for I shall be as much frightene at the first strange man that I meet with : and I be persuade that fear bring one into more danger , than the caution , that go along with it , deliver one from . I then lock the door , and put the key in my pocket , and be in a sad quandary ; but I be soon determined ; for the maid come in sight , and ask , if any thing be the matter , that I be so often up and down stair ? God forgive I , ( but I have a sad lie at my tongue 's end , ) say I ; though be sometimes a little hard upon I , yet I know not where I be without she : I go up , and I come down to walk about in the garden ; and , not have she , know scarcely what to do with myself . ay , say the ideot , she be main good company , madam , no wonder you miss she . so here I be again , and here likely to be ; for I have no courage to help myself any where else . of why be poor foolish maiden try with such danger , when they have such weak mind to grapple with they !-- I will , since it be so , hope the best : but yet I can not but observe how grievously every thing make against I : for here be the robber ; though I fall not into they hand myself , yet they give I as much terror , and have as great a effect upon my fear , as if I have : and here be the bull ; it have as effectually frightene I , as if I have be hurt by it instead of the cook -maid ; and so these join together , as I may say , to make a very dastard of I . but my folly be the worst of all , because that deprive I of my money : for have I have that , I believe I should have venture both the bull and the robber . afternoon . so , be return from she visit : well , say she , I would have you set you heart at rest ; for will do very well again . he be not half so bad as he fancie . of these scholar , say she , they have not the heart of mouse ! he have only a few scratch on he face ; which , say she , I suppose he get by grapple among the gravel at the bottom of the dam , to try to find a hole in the ground , to hide himself from the robber . he shin and he knee be hardly to be see to ail any thing . he say in he letter , he be a frightful spectacle : he might be so , indeed , when he first come in a door ; but he look well enough now : and , only for a few groan now and then , when he think of he danger , I see nothing be the matter with he . so , , say she , I would have you be very
very easy about it . I be glad of it , say I , for all you joke , to . well , say she , he talk of nothing but you : and when I tell he I would fain have persuade you to come with I , the man be out of he wit with he gratitude to I : and so have laid open all he heart to I , and tell I all that have pass , and be contrive between you two . this alarm I prodigiously ; and the rather , as I see , by two or three instance , that he honest heart could keep nothing , believe every one as undesigning as himself . I say , but yet with a heavy heart , ah ! , , this might have do with I , have he have any thing that he could have tell you of . but you know well enough , that have we be dispose , we have no opportunity for it , from you watchful care and circumspection . no , say she , that be very true , ; not so much as for that declaration that he own before I , he have find opportunity , for all my watchfulness , to make you . come , come , say she , no more of these sham with I ! you have a excellent head - piece for you year ; but may be I be as cunn as you .--However , say she , all be well now ; because my watchment be now over , by my master 's direction . how have you employ yourself in my absence ? I be so troublead at what might have pass between and she , that I could not hide it ; and she say , well , , since all matter be likely to be so soon and so happily end , let I advise you to be a little less concerned at he discoveries ; and make I you confident , as he have do , and I shall think you have some favour for I , and reliance upon I ; and perhaps you might not repent it . she be so earnest , that I mistrust she do this to pump I ; and I know how , now , to account for she kindness to in she visit to he ; which be only to get out of he what she could . why , , say I , be all this fish about for something , where there be nothing , if there be a end of you watchment , as you call they ? nothing , say she , but womanish curiosity , I will assure you ; for one be naturally lead to find out matter , where there be such privacy intend . well , say I , pray let I know what he have say ; and then I will give you a answer to you curiosity . I do not care , say she , whether you do or not for I have as much as I want from he ; and I despair of get out of you any thing you ha ' not a mind I should know , my little cunning dear .-- well , say I , let he have say what he would , I care not : for I be sure he can say no harm of I ; and so let we change the talk . I be the easier , indeed , because , for all she pump , she give no hint of the key and the door , etc. which , have he communicate to she , she would not have forborne give I a touch of .-- and so we give up one another , as despairing to gain we end of each other . but I be sure he must have say more than he should . -- and I be the more apprehensive all be not right , because she have now be actually , these two hour , shut up a writing ; though she pretend she have give I up all she store of papers , etc. and that I should write for she . I begin to wish I have venture every thing and go off , when I might . of when will this state of doubt and uneasiness end ! she have just be with I , and say she shall send a messenger to ; and he shall carry a letter of thanks for I , if I will write it for my master 's favour to I . indeed , say I , I have no thanks to give , till I be with my father and mother : and besides , I send a letter , as you know ; but have have no answer to it . she say , she think that he letter to be sufficient ; and the least I could do be to thank he , if but in two line . no need of it , say I ; for I do not intend to have : what then be that letter to I ? well , say she , I see thou be quite unfathomable ! I do not like all this . of my foolish fear of bull and robber !-- for now all my uneasiness begin to double upon I . o what have this incautious man say ! that , no doubt , be the subject of she long letter . I will close this day 's writing , with just say , that she be mighty silent and reserve , to what she be : and say nothing but , or yes , to what I ask . something must be hatch , I doubt !-- I the rather think so ,
, because I find she do not keep she word with I , about lie by myself , and my money ; to both which point she return suspicious answer , say , as to the one , why , you be mighty earnest for you money ; I sha not run away with it . and to the other , good - lack ! you need not be so willing , as I know of , to part with I for a bed - fellow , till you be sure of one you like better . this cut I to the heart ; and , at the same time , stop my mouth . , . have be here ; but we have have no opportunity to talk together : he seem confound at 's change of temper , and reservedness , after she kind visit , and they freedom with one another , and much more at what I be go to tell you . he ask , if I would take a turn in the garden with and he . no , say she , I can not go . say he , not take a walk ?-- no , say she ; I desire she will not . why , ? say he : I be afraid I have somehow disoblige you . not at all , reply she ; but I suppose you will soon be at liberty to walk together as much as you please : and I have send a messenger for my last instruction , about this and more weighty matter ; and when they come I shall leave you to do as you both will ; but , till then , it be no matter how little you be together . this alarm we both ; and he seem quite struck of a heap , and put on , as I think , a self - accuse countenance . so I go behind she back , and hold my two hand together , flat , with a bit of paper , I have , between they , and look at he : and he seem to take I as I intend ; intimat the renewing of the correspondence by the tiles . I leave they both together , and retire to my closet to write a letter for the tiles ; but have no time for a copy , I will give you the substance only . I expostulate with he on he too great openness and easiness to fall into 's snare : tell he my apprehension of foul play ; and give briefly the reason which move I : beg to know what he have say ; and intimate , that I think there be the highest reason to resume we prospect of the escape by the back - door . I put this in the usual place in the evening ; and now wait with impatience for a answer . . I have the follow answer : ' , be utterly confound , and must plead guilty to all you just reproach . I wish I be master of all but half you caution and discretion ! I hope , after all , this be only a touch of this ill woman 's temper , to show she power and importance : for I think ---- neither can nor dare deceive I in so black a manner . I would expose he all the world over if he do . but it be not , can not be in he . I have receive a letter from , in which he tell I , that he master be prepare for he journey ; and belief , afterwards , he will come into these part : but he say , be at they house , and be to accompany she brother to , or meet he there , he know not which . he profess great zeal and affection to you service : and I find he refer to a letter he send I before , but which be not come to my hand . I think there can be no treachery ; for it be a particular friend at , that I have order he to direct to ; and this be come safe to my hand by this mean ; for well I know , I durst trust nothing to , at the post -house here . this give I a little pain ; but I hope all will end well , and we shall soon hear , if it be necessary to pursue we former intention . if it be , I will lose no time to provide a horse for you , and another for myself ; for I can never do either or myself better service , though I be to forego all my expectation for it here , I be 's you most faithful humble servant . ' 'I be too free indeed with , lead to it by she dissimulation , and by she pretended concern to make I happy with you . I hint , that I would not have scruple to have procure you deliverance by any means ; and that I have propose to you , as the only honourable one , marriage with I . but I assure she , though she would hardly believe I , that you discourage my application : which be too true ! but not a word of the back - door key , etc. ' continue still sullen and ill - natured , and I be almost afraid to speak to she . she watch I as close as ever , and pretend to wonder why I shin she company as I do . I have just put under the tiles these line inspire by my fear , which be indeed very strong ; and , I doubt , not without reason .
. ' , ' every thing give I additional disturbance . the missed letter of 's make I suspect a plot . yet be I loath to think myself of so much importance , as to suppose every one in a plot against I . be you sure , however , the journey be not to be a one ? may not , who have be once a traitor , be so again ?-- why need I be thus in doubt ?--if I could have this horse , I would turn the rein on he neck , and trust to to guide he for my safeguard ! for I would not endanger you , now just upon the edge of you preferment . yet , sir , I fear you fatal openness will make you suspect as accessary , let we be ever so cautious . ' be my life in question , instead of my honesty , I would not wish to involve you , or any body , in the least difficulty , for so worthless a poor creature . but , of sir ! my soul be of equal importance with the soul of a princess ; though my quality be inferior to that of the meanest slave . ' save then my innocence , good Heaven ! and preserve my mind spotless ; and happy shall I be to lay down my worthless life ; and see a end to all my trouble and anxiety . ' forgive my impatience : but my presage mind bode horrid mischief ! every thing look dark around I ; and this woman 's impenetrable sullenness and silence , without any apparent reason , from a conduct so very contrary , bid I fear the worst .-- blame I , sir , if you think I wrong ; and let I have you advice what to do ; which will oblige ' you most afflict servant . ' . I have this half - angry answer ; but , what be more to I than all the letter in the world could be , yours , my dear father , enclose . ' madam , ' I think you be too apprehensive by much ; I be sorry for you uneasiness . you may depend upon I , and all I can do . but I make no doubt of the journey , nor of 's contrition and fidelity . I have just receive , from my Gainsborough friend , this letter , as I suppose , from you good father , in a cover , direct for I , as I have desire . I hope it contain nothing to add to you uneasiness . pray , dearest madam , lay aside you fear , and wait a few day for the issue of 's letter , and mine of thanks to ---- . thing , I hope , must be better than you expect . Providence will not desert such piety and innocence : and be this you comfort and reliance : which be the best advice that can at present be give , by ' you most faithful humble servant . ' . . the father 's letter be as follow : ' my , ' we prayer be at length heard , and we be overwhelm with joy . of what suffering , what trials , hast thou go through ! bless be the goodness , which have enable thee to withstand so many temptation ! we have not yet have leisure to read through you long account of all you hardship . I say long , because I wonder how you could find time and opportunity for they : but otherwise they be the delight of we spare hour ; and we shall read they over and over , as long as we live , with thankfulness to , who have give we so virtuous and so discreet a daughter . how happy be we lot in the midst of we poverty ! of let none ever think child a burden to they ; when the poorest circumstance can produce so much riche in a Pamela ! Persist , my dear daughter , in the same excellent course ; and we shall not envy the highest estate , but defy they to produce such a daughter as ours . 'I say , we have not read through all yours in course . we be too impatient , and so turn to the end ; where we find you virtue within view of its reward , and you master 's heart turn to see the folly of he way , and the injury he have intend to we dear child : for , to be sure , my dear , he would have ruin you , if he could . but see you virtue , he heart be touch ; and he have , no doubt , be awaken by you good example . ' we do not see that you can do any way so well , as to come into the present proposal , and make , the worthy ! bless he !-- happy . and though we be poor , and can add no merit , no reputation , no fortune , to we dear child , but rather must be a disgrace to she , as the world will think ; yet I hope I do not sin in my pride , to say , that there be no good man , of a common degree , ( especially as you late lady 's kindness give you such good opportunity , which you have have the grace to improve , ) but may think himself happy in you . but , as you say , you have rather not marry at present , far be it from we to offer violence to you inclination ! so much prudence as you have shew in
in all you conduct , would make it very wrong in we to mistrust it in this , or to offer to direct you in you choice . , alas ! my child , what can we do for you ?-- to partake we hard lot , and involve yourself into as hard a life , would not help we , but add to you affliction . but it will be time enough to talk of these thing , when we have the pleasure you now put we in hope of , of see you with we ; which grant . amen , amen , say ' you most indulgent parent . amen ! ' ' we humblest service and thanks to the worthy . again we say , bless he for ever ! 'o what a deal we have to say to you ! give we a happy meeting ! we understand the ' squire be set out for . he be a fine gentleman , and have wit at will . I wish he be as good . but I hope he will now reform . ' of what inexpressible comfort , my dear father , have you letter give I !-- you ask , what can you do for I ?-- what be it you can not do for you child ! -- you can give she the advice she have so much want , and still want , and will always want : you can confirm she in the path of virtue , into which you first initiate she ; and you can pray for she , with heart so sincere and pure , that be not to be meet with in palace !-- oh ! how I long to throw myself at you foot , and receive from you own lip the blessing of such good parent ! but , alas ! how be my prospect again overcloude , to what they be when I close my last parcel ! -- more trials , more danger , I fear , must you poor Pamela be engage in : but through the goodness , and you prayer , I hope , at last , to get well out of all my difficulty ; and the rather , as they be not the effect of my own vanity or presumption ! but I will proceed with my hopeless story . I see be a little nettle at my impatience ; and so I write to assure he I would be as easy as I could , and wholly direct by he ; especially as my father , whose respects I mention , have assure I my master be set out for , which he must have somehow from he own family or he would not have write I word of it . , . have be here both these day , as usual ; but be very indifferently receive still by ; and , to avoid suspicion , I leave they together , and go up to my closet , most of the time he be here . he and she , I find by she , have a quarrel : and she seem quite out of humwe with he : but I think it best not to say any thing : and he say , he would very little trouble the house till he have a answer to he letter from ---- . and she return , the less , the better . poor man ! he have get but little by he openness , make he confident , as she brag , and would have have I to do likewise . I be more and more satisfied there be mischief brewing ; and shall begin to hide my papers , and be circumspect . she seem mighty impatient for a answer to she letter to my master . , , the 25th and 26th day of my heavy restraint . still more and more strange thing to write ! a messenger be return , and now all be out ! of wretch , wretch ! what , at last , will become of I !-- such strange turn and trial sure never poor creature , of my year , experienced . he bring two letter , one to , and one to I : but , as the greatest wit may be sometimes mistaken , they be fold and seal alike , that for I be direct to ; and that for she be direct to I . but both be stark natch , abominably bad ! she bring I up that direct for I , and say , here be a letter for you : long - look - for be come at last . I will ask the messenger a few question , and then I will read mine . so she go down , and I break it open in my closet , and find it direct to . . but when I open it , it begin , . I be quite confound ; but , think I , this may be a lucky mistake ; I may discover something : and so I read on these horrid contents : ' Mr . Jewkes , ' what you write I , have give I no small disturbance . this wretch 's play - thing , no doubt , be ready to leap at any thing that offer , rather than express the least sense of gratitude for all the benefit she have receive from my family , and which I be determine more and more to heap upon she . I reserve she for my future resentment ; and I charge you double you diligence in watch she , to prevent she escape . I send this by a honest Swiss , who attend I in my travels ; a man I can trust ; and so let he be you assistant
assistant : for the artful creature be enough to corrupt a nation by she see innocence and simplicity ; and she may have get a party , perhaps , among my servants with you , as she have here . even , whom I confide in , and favour more than any , have prove a execrable villain ; and shall meet he reward for it . ' as to that college novice , , I need not bid you take care he see not this pain bauble : for I have order , my attorney , to throw he instantly into gaol , on a action of debt , for money he have have of I , which I have intend never to carry to account against he ; for I know all he rascally practice , besides what you write I of he perfidious intrigue with that girl , and he acknowledge contrivance for she escape ; when he know not , for certain , that I design she any mischief ; and when , if he have be guide by a sense of piety , or compassion for injured innocence , as he pretend , he would have expostulate with I , as he function , and my friendship for he , might have allow he . but to enter into a vile intrigue with the amiable gewgaw , to favour she escape in so base a manner , ( to say nothing of he disgraceful practice against I , in 's family , of which himself have inform I ) , be a conduct that , instead of prefer the ungrateful wretch , as I have intend , shall pull down upon he utter ruin . ' , my trusty Swiss , will obey you without reserve , if my other servants refuse . 'as for she deny that she encourage he declaration , I believe it not . it be certain the speak picture , with all that pretend innocence and bashfulness , would have run away with he . yes , she would run away with a fellow that she have be acquaint with ( and that not intimately , if you be as careful as you ought to be ) but a few day ; at a time when she have the strongest assurance of my honour to she . ' well , I think , I now hate she perfectly : and though I will do nothing to she myself , yet I can bear , for the sake of my revenge , and my injured honour and slighte love , to see any thing , even what she most fear , be do to she ; and then she may be turn loose to she evil destiny , and echo to the wood and grove she piteous lamentation for the loss of she fantastical innocence , which the romantic ideot make such a work about . I shall go to , with my sister Davers ; and the moment I can disengage myself , which , perhaps , may be in three week from this time , I will be with you , and decide she fate , and put a end to you trouble . mean time be doubly careful ; for this innocent , as I have warn you , be full of contrivance . I be ' you friend . ' I have but just read this dreadful letter through , when come up in a great fright , guess at the mistake , and that I have she letter , and she find I with it open in my hand , just sink away . what business , say she , have you to read my letter ? and snatch it from I . you see , say she , look upon it , it say , at top : you ink , in manners , to have read no further . o add not , say I , to my affliction ! I shall be soon out of all you way ! this be too much ! too much ! I never can support this -- and throw myself upon the couch , in my closet , and weep most bitterly . she read it in the next room , and come in again afterwards . why , this , say she , be a sad letter indeed : I be sorry for it : but I fear you would carry you nicety too far !-- leave I , leave I , , say I , for a while : I can not speak nor talk .-- poor heart ! say she ; well , I will come up again presently , and hope to find you better . but here , take you own letter ; I wish you well ; but this be a sad mistake ! and so she put down by I that which be intend for I : but I have no spirit to read it at present . of man ! man ! hard - hear , cruel man ! what mischief be thou not capable of , unrelenting persecutor as thou art ! I sit ruminat , when I have a little come to myself , upon the term of this wicked letter ; and have no inclination to look into my own . the bad name , fool 's play - thing , artful creature , paint bauble , gewgaw , speak picture , be hard word for you poor ! and I begin to think whether I be not indeed a very naughty body , and have not do vile thing : but when I think of he have discover poor , and of 's base officiousness , in tell he of , with what he have resolve against he in revenge for he goodness to I , I be quite dispirit ; and yet still more about
about that fearful Colbrand , and what he could see do to I : for then I be ready to gasp for breath , and my heart quite fail I . then how dreadful be the word , that he will decide my fate in three week ! , say I , strike I dead , before that time , with a thunderbolt , or provide some way for my escaping these threaten mischief ! God forgive I , if I sinn ! at last , I take up the letter direct for , but design for I ; and I find that little better than the other . these be the hard term it contain : ' well have you do , perverse , forward , artful , yet , to convince I , before it be too late , how ill I have do to place my affections on so unworthy a object : I have vow honour and love to you unworthiness , believe you a mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted innocence ; and that no perfidious design lurk in so fair a bosom . but now I have find you out , you specious hypocrite ! and I see , that though you could not repose the least confidence in one you have know for year , and who , under my good mother 's misplace favour for you , have grow up in a manner with you ; when my passion , in spite of my pride , and the difference of we condition , make I stoop to a meanness that now I despise myself for ; yet you could enter into a intrigue with a man you never know till within these few day past , and resolve to run away with a stranger , whom you fair face , and insinuat art , have bewitch to break through all the tie of honour and gratitude to I , even at a time when the happiness of he future life depend upon my favour . ' Henceforth , for 's sake , whenever I see a lovely face , will I mistrust a deceitful heart ; and whenever I hear of the greatest pretence to innocence , will I suspect some deep - laid mischief . you be determined to place no confidence in I , though I have solemnly , over and over , engage my honour to you . what , though I have alarm you fear in send you one way , when you hope to go another ; yet , have I not , to convince you of my resolution to do justly by you , ( although with great reluctance , such then be my love for you , ) engage not to come near you without you own consent ? be not this a voluntary demonstration of the generosity of my intention to you ? yet how have you requit I ? the very first fellow that you charme face , and insinuat address , could influence , you have practise upon , corrupt too , I may say , ( and even ruin , as the ungrateful wretch shall find , ) and throw you forward self upon he . as , therefore , you would place no confidence in I , my honou owe you nothing ; and , in a little time , you shall find how much you have er , in treating , as you have do , a man who be once ' you affectionate and kind friend . ' ' . have direction concern you : and if you lot be now harder than you might wish , you will bear it the easier , because you own rash folly have bring it upon you . ' ! for I , what a fate be mine , to be thus think artful , and forward , and ungrateful ; when all I intend be to preserve my innocence ; and when all the poor little shift , which he superior wicked wit and cunning have render ineffectual , be force upon I in my own necessary defence ! when come up to I again , she find I bath in tear . she seem , as I think , to be move to some compassion ; and find myself now entirely in she power , and that it be not for I to provoke she , I say , it be now , I see , in vain for I to contend against my evil destiny , and the superior art of my barbarous master . I will resign myself to the divine will , and prepare to expect the worst . but you see how this poor be draw in and undone : I be sorry I be make the cause of he ruin . poor , poor man ! -- to be thus involved , and for my sake too ! --but if you will believe I , say I , I give no encouragement to what he propose , as to marriage ; nor would he have propose it , I believe , but as the only honourable way he think be leave to save I : and he principal motive to it at all , be virtue and compassion to one in distress . what other view could he have ? you know I be poor and friendless . all I beg of you be , to let the poor gentleman have notice of my master 's resentment ; and let he fly the country , and not be throw into gaol . this will answer my master 's end as well ; for it will as effectually hinder he from assist I , as if he be in a prison . ask I , say she , to do any thing that be in my power , consistent with my duty and trust , and
and I will do it : for I be sorry for you both . but , to be sure , I shall keep no correspondence with he , nor let you . I offer to talk of a duty superior to that she mention , which would oblige she to help distress innocence , and not permit she to go the length enjoin by lawless tyranny ; but she plainly bid I be silent on that head : for it be in vain to attempt to persuade she to betray she trust : -- all I have to advise you , say she , be to be easy ; lay aside all you contrivance and art to get away , and make I you friend , by give I no reason to suspect you ; for I glory in my fidelity to my master : and you have both practise some strange sly art , to make such a progress as he have own there be between you , so seldom as I think you see one another ; and I must be more circumspect than I have be . this double my concern ; for I now apprehend I should be much closer watch than before . well , say I , since I have , by this strange accident , discover my hard destiny ; let I read over again that fearful letter of yours , that I may get it by heart , and with it feed my distress , and make calamity familiar to I . then , say she , let I read yours again . I give she mine , and she lent I hers : and so I take a copy of it , with she leave ; because , as I say I would , by it , prepare myself for the worst . and when I have do , I pinne it on the head of the couch : this , say I , be the use I shall make of this wretch copy of you letter ; and here you shall always find it wet with my tear . she say she would go down to order supper ; and insist upon my company to it . I would have excuse myself ; but she begin to put on a commanding air , that I durst not oppose . and when I go down , she take I by the hand , and present I to the most hideous monster I ever see in my life . here , , say she , here be you pretty ward and mine ; let we try to make she time with we easy . he bow , and put on he foreign grimace , and seem to bless himself ; and , in broken , tell I , I be happy in de affections of finest gentleman in !-- I be quite frightened , and ready to drop down ; and I will describe he to you , my dear father and mother , if now you will ever see this : and you shall judge if I have not reason , especially not know he be to be there , and be apprise , as I be , of he hate employment , to watch I closer . he be a giant of a man for stature ; taller by a good deal than , in you neighbourhood , and large boned , and scraggy ; and have a hand !-- I never see such a one in my life . he have great staring eye , like the bull 's that frightene I so ; vast jaw - bone stick out : eyebrow hang over he eye ; two great scars upon he forehead , and one on he left cheek ; and two large whisker , and a monstrous wide mouth ; blubber lip ; long yellow tooth , and a hideous grin . he wear he own frightful long hair , tie up in a great black bag ; a black crape neckcloth about a long ugly neck : and he throat stick out like a wen . as to the rest , he be dress well enough , and have a sword on , with a nasty red knot to it ; leather garter , buck below he knee ; and a foot -- near as long as my arm , I verily think . he say , he fright de lady ; and offer to withdraw ; but she bid he not ; and I tell , that as she know I have be cry , she should not have call I to the gentleman without let I know he be there . I soon go up to my closet ; for my heart ach all the time I be at table , not be able to look upon he without horror ; and this brute of a woman , though she see my distress , before this addition to it , no doubt do it on purpose to strike more terror into I . and indeed it have it be effect : for when I go to bed , I could think of nothing but he hideous person , and my master 's more hideous action : and think they too well pair ; and when I dropt asleep , I dream they be both come to my bedside , with the worst design ; and I jump out of my bed in my sleep , and frightene ; till , wake with the terror , I tell she my dream ; and the wick creature only laugh , and say , all I fear be but a dream , as well as that ; and when it be over , and I be well awake , I should laugh at it as such ! and now I be come to the close of , the
the 27th day of my distress . poor be actually arrest , and carry away to . so there be a end of all my hope from he , poor gentleman ! he over - security and openness have ruin we both ! I be but too well convince , that we ought not to have lose a moment 's time ; but he be half angry , and think I too impatient ; and then he fatal confession , and the detestable artifice of my master ! -- but one might well think , that he who have so cunningly , and so wickedly , contrive all he stratagem hithertoo , that it be impossible to avoid they , would stick at nothing to complete they . I fear I shall soon find it so ! but one stratagem I have just invent , though a very discouraging one to think of ; because I have neither friend nor money , nor know one step of the way , if I be out of the house . but let bull , and bear , and lion , and tiger , and , what be worse , false , treacherous , deceitful man , stand in my way , I can not be in more danger than I be ; and I depend nothing upon he three week : for how do I know , now he be in such a passion , and have already begin he vengeance on poor , that he will not change he mind , and come down to Lincolnshire before he go to ? my stratagem be this : I will endeaavor to get to go to be without I , as she often do , while I sit lock up in my closet : and as she sleep very sound in she first sleep , of which she never fail to give notice by snoring , if I can but then get out between the two bar of the window , ( for you know I be very slender , and I find I can get my head through , ) then I can drop upon the lead underneath , which be little more than my height , and which lead be over a little summer - parlour , that jut out towards the garden ; and as I be light , I can easily drop from they ; for they be not high from the ground : then I shall be in the garden ; and then , as I have the key of the back - door , I will get out . but I have another piece of cunning still : , succeed to I my dangerous , but innocent device !-- I have read of a great captain , who , be in danger , leape overboard into the sea , and he enemy , as he swam , shoot at he with bow and arrow , he unloose he upper garment , and take another course , while they stick that full of they dart and arrow ; and so he escape , and live to triumph over they all . so what will I do , but strip off my upper petticoat , and throw it into the pond , with my neckhandkerchief ! for to be sure , when they miss I , they will go to the pond first , think I have drown myself : and so , when they see some of my clothes float there , they will be all employ in drag the pond , which be a very large one ; and as I shall not , perhaps , be miss till the morning , this will give I opportunity to get a great way off ; and I be sure I will run for it when I be out . and so I trust , that Providence will direct my step to some good place of safety , and make some worthy body my friend ; for sure , if I suffer ever so , I can not be in more danger , nor in worse hand , than where I be ; and with such avowed bad designs . of my dear parent ! do not be frightene when you come to read this ! -- but all will be over before you can see it ; and so direct I for the best ! my writings , for fear I should not escape , I will bury in the garden ; for , to be sure , I shall be search and use dreadfully if I can not get off . and so I will close here , for the present , to prepare for my plot . Prosper thou , of gracious Protector of oppress innocence ! this last effort of thy poor handmaid ! that I may escape the crafty device and snare that have begin to entangle my virtue ; and from which , but by this one trial , I see no way of escaping . and oh ! whatever become of I , bless my dear parent , and protect poor from ruin ! for he be happy before he know I . just now , just now ! I hear , who be in she cup , own to the , that the robbing of poor be a contrivance of hers , and execute by the groom and a helper , in order to seize my letter upon he , which they miss . they be now both laugh at the dismal story , which they little think I overhear -- of how my heart ach ! for what be not such wretch capable of ! can you blame I for endeavouring , through any danger , to get out of such clutch ? past eleven o'clock . be come up , and go to bed ; and bids I not stay
stay long in my closet , but come to bed . of for a dead sleep for the treacherous brute ! I never see she so tipsy , and that give I hope . I have try again , and find I can get my head through the iron bars . I be now all prepare , as soon as I hear she fast ; and now I will seal up these , and my other papers , my last work : and to thy providence , of my gracious ! commit the rest .-- once more , bless you both ! and send we a happy meeting ; if not here , in he heavenly kingdom . amen . , , , , the 28th , 29th , 30th , and 31st day of my distress . and distress indeed ! for here I be still ; and every thing have be worse and worse ! oh ! the poor unhappy !-- without any hope leave , and ruin in all my contrivance . but , oh ! my dear parent , rejoice with I , even in this low plunge of my distress ; for you poor have escape from a enemy worse than any she ever meet with ; a enemy she never think of before , and be hardly able to stand against : I mean , the weakness and presumption , both in one , of she own mind ; which have well nigh , have not the divine grace interpose , sink she into the lowest , last abyss of misery and perdition ! I will proceed , as I have opportunity , with my sad relation : for my pen and ink ( in my now doubly - secured closet ) be all I have to employ myself with : and indeed I have be so weak , that , till yesterday evening , I have not be able to hold a pen . I take with I but one shift , besides what I have on , and two handkerchief , and two cap , which my pocket hold , ( for it be not for I to encumber myself , ) and all my stock of money , which be but five or six shilling , to set out for I know not where ; and get out of the window , not without some difficulty , stick a little at my shoulders and hip ; but I be resolve to get out , if possible . and it be farther from the lead than I think , and I be afraid I have sprain my ancle ; and when I have dropt from the lead to the ground , it be still farther off ; but I do pretty well there , at least . I get no hurt to hinder I from pursue my intentions . so be now on the ground , I hide my papers under a rose - bush , and cover they with mould , and there they still lie , as I hope . then I hy away to the pond : the clock struck twelve , just as I get out ; and it be a dark misty night , and very cold ; but I feel it not then . when I come to the pond -side , I fling in my upper - coat , as I have design , and my neckhandkerchief , and a round - eared cap , with a knot ; and then with great speed run to the door , and take the key out of my pocket , my poor heart beat all the time against my bosom , as if it would have force its way through it : and beat it well might ! for I then , too late , find , that I be most miserably disappoint ; for the wicked woman have take off that lock , and put another on ; so that my key would not open it . I try , and try , and feel about , I find a padlock besides , on another part of the door . of then how my heart sink !-- I dropt down with grief and confusion , unable to stir or support myself , for a while . but my fear awaken my resolution , and know that my attempt would be as terrible for I as any other danger I could then encounter , I clamber up upon the ledge of the door , and upon the lock , which be a great wooden one ; and reach the top of the door with my hand ; then , little think I could climb so well , I make shift to lay hold on the top of the wall with my hand ; but , alas for I ! nothing but ill luck !-- no escape for poor ! the wall be old , the brick I hold by give way , just as I be take a spring to get up ; and down come I , and receive such a blow upon my head , with one of the brick , that it quite stun I ; and I break my shin and my ancle besides , and beat off the heel of one of my shoe . in this dreadful way , flat upon the ground , lay poor I , for I believe five or six minute ; and then try to get up , I sink down again two or three time ; and my left hip and shoulder be very stiff , and full of pain , with bruise ; and , besides , my head b , and ach grievously with the blow I have with the brick . yet these hurts I value not ; but creep a good way upon my foot and hand , in search of a
a ladder , I just recollect to have see against the wall two day before , on which the gardener be nail a nectarine branch that be loose from the wall : but no ladder could I find , and the wall be very high . what now , think I , must become of the miserable !-- then I begin to wish myself most heartily again in my closet , and to repent of my attempt , which I now censure as rash , because it do not succeed . God forgive I ! but a sad thought come just then into my head !-- I tremble to think of it ! indeed my apprehension of the usage I should meet with , have like to have make I miserable for ever ! of my dear , dear parent , forgive you poor child ; but be then quite desperate , I creep along , till I could raise myself on my staggering foot ; and away lim I !-- what to do , but to throw myself into the pond , and so put a period to all my grief in this world !-- but , of ! to find they infinitely aggravate ( have I not , by the divine grace , be withheld ) in a miserable eternity ! as I have escape this temptation , ( bless be for it ! ) I will tell you my conflict on this dreadful occasion , that the divine mercy may be magnify in my deliverance , that I be yet on this side the dreadful gulf , from which there could have be no return . it be well for I , as I have since think , that I be so maimed , as make I the longer before I get to the water ; for this give I time to consider , and abate the impetuousness of my passion , which possibly might otherwise have hurrie I , in my first transport of grief , ( on my see no way to escape , and the hard usage I have reason to expect from my dreadful keeper , ) to throw myself in . but my weakness of body make I move so slowly , that it give time , as I say , for a little reflection , a ray of , to dart in upon my benighted mind ; and so , when I come to the pond -side , I sit myself down on the sloping bank , and begin to ponder my wretch condition ; and thus I reaso with myself . Pause here a little , , on what thou be about , before thou takest the dreadful leap ; and consider whether there be no way yet leave , no hope , if not to escape from this wick house , yet from the mischief threaten thee in it . I then consider ; and , after I have cast about in my mind every thing that could make I hope , and see no probability ; a wicked woman , devoid of all compassion ! a horrid helper , just arrive , in this dreadful Colbrand ! a angry and resent master , who now hate I , and threaten the most afflicting evils ! and that I should , in all probability , be deprive even of the opportunity , I now have before I , to free myself from all they persecution !-- what hast thou to do , distress creature , say I to myself , but throw thyself upon a merciful , ( who know how innocently I suffer , ) to avoid the merciless wickedness of those who be determine on my ruin ? and then , think I , ( and oh ! that thought be surely of the 's instigation ; for it be very soothing , and powerful with I , ) these wicked wretch , who now have no remorse , no pity on I , will then be move to lament they misdoing ; and when they see the dead corpse of the unhappy Pamela drag out to these dewy banks , and lie breathless at they foot , they will find that remorse to soften they obdurate heart , which , now , have no place there ! -- and my master , my angry master , will then forget he resentment , and say , o , this be the unhappy Pamela ! that I have so causelessly persecute and destroy ! now do I see she prefer she honesty to she life , will he say , and be no hypocrite , nor deceiver ; but really be the innocent creature she pretend to be ! then , think I , will he , perhaps , she a few tear over the poor corpse of he persecute servant ; and though he may give out , it be love and disappointment ; and that , perhaps , ( in order to hide he own guilt , ) for the unfortunate , yet will he be inwardly grieved , and order I a decent funeral , and save I , or rather this part of I , from the dreadful stake , and the highway interment ; and the young man and maiden all around my dear father 's will pity poor ! but , of ! I hope I shall not be the subject of they ballad and elegy ; but that my memory , for the sake of my dear father and mother , may quickly slide into . I be once rise , so indulgent be I to this sad way of think , to throw myself in : but , again , my bruise make I slow ; and I think , what be thou about to do , wretch ? how knowest thou , though the prospect be all dark to thy
thy short - sighted eye , what may do for thee , even when all human mean fail ? would not lay I under these sore affliction , if he have not give I strength to grapple with they , if I will exert it as I ink : and who know , but that the very presence I so much dread of my angry and design master , ( for he have have I in he power before , and yet I have escape ;) may be better for I , than these persecut emissary of he , who , for he money , be true to they wicked trust , and be harden by that , and a long habit of wickedness , against compunction of heart ? can touch he heart in a instant ; and if this should not be do , I can then but put a end to my life by some other means , if I be so resolve . but how do i know , think I , that even these bruise and maim that I have get , while I pursue only the laudable escape I have meditate , may not kindly have furnish I with the opportunity I be now temp with to precipitate myself , and of surrendere up my life , spotless and unguilty , to that merciful be who give it ! then , think I , who give thee , presumptuous as thou art , a power over thy life ? who authorise thee to put a end to it , when the weakness of thy mind suggest not to thee a way to preserve it with honour ? how knowest thou what purpose may have to serve , by the trial with which thou be now exercise ? Art thou to put a bound to the divine will , and to say , thus much will I bear , and no more ? and will thou dare to say , that if the trial be augment and continue , thou will sooner die than bear it ? this act of despondency , think I , be a sin , that , if I pursue it , admit of no repentance , and can therefore hope no forgiveness . -- and will thou , to shorten thy transitory grief , heavy as they be , and weak as thou fanciest thyself , plunge both body and soul into everlasting misery ! , , think I , thou be the innocent , the suffer ; and will thou , to avoid thy suffering , be the guilty aggressor ? and , because wick man persecute thee , will thou fly in the face of the , and distrust he grace and goodness , who can still turn all these suffering to benefit ? and how do i know , but that , who see all the lurking vileness of my heart , may have permit these suffering on that very score , and to make I rely solely on he grace and assistance , who , perhaps , have too much pride myself in a vain dependence on my own foolish contrivance ? then , again , think I , will thou suffer in one moment all the good lesson of thy poor honest parent , and the benefit of they example , ( who have persist in do they duty with resignation to the divine will , amidst the extreme degree of disappointment , poverty , and distress , and the persecution of a ungrateful world , and merciless creditor , ) to be throw away upon thee : and bring down , as in all probability this thy rashness will , they grey hair with sorrow to the grave , when they shall understand , that they belove daughter , slighte the tender of divine grace , despairing of the mercy of a protect , have blemish , in this last act , a whole life , which they have hitherto approve and delighte in ? what then , presumptuous , dost thou here ? think I : quit with speed these perilous banks , and fly from these curling water , that seem , in they mean murmur , this still night , to reproach thy rashness ! not 's goodness on the mossy bannks , that have be witness of thy guilty purpose : and while thou hast power left thee , avoid the tempting evil , lest thy grand enemy , now repulse by divine grace , and due reflection , return to the assault with a force that thy weakness may not be able to resist ! and let one rash moment destroy all the conviction , which now have aw thy rebellious mind into duty and resignation to the divine will ! and so say , I arise ; but be so stiff with my hurt , so cold with the moist dew of the night , and the wet grass on which I have sat , as also with the damp arise from so large a piece of water , that with great pain I get from this pond , which now I think of with terror ; and bend my limping step towards the house , take refuge in the corner of a outhouse , where wood and coal be lay up for family use , till I should be find by my cruel keeper , and consign to a more wretched confinement , and worse usage than I have hithertoo experienced ; and there behind a pile of firewood I creep , and lay down , as you may imagine , with a mind just break , and a heart sensible to nothing but the extremest woe and dejection . this , my dear father and mother , be the issue of you poor 's fruitless enterprise ; and who know , if I have get out at
at the back - door , whether I have be at all in a better case , moneyless , friendless , as I be , and in a strange place ! -- but blame not you poor daughter too much : Nay , if ever you see this miserable scribble , all bath and blot with my tear , let you pity get the better of you reprehension ! but I know it will -- and I must leave off for the present .-- for , oh ! my strength and my will be at this time very far unequal to one another . -- but yet I will add , that though I should have praise for my deliverance , have I be free from my wicked keeper , and my design master ; yet I have more abundant reason to praise he , that I have be deliver from a worse enemy ,-- myself ! I will conclude my sad relation . it seem awak not till day - break ; and not find I in bed , she call I ; and , no answer be return , she relate , that she get out of bed , and run to my closet ; and , miss I , search under the bed , and in another closet , find the chamber - door as she have leave it , quite fast , and the key , as usual , about she wrist . for if I could have get out of the chamber - door , there be two or three passage , and door to they all , double - lock and barr , to go through into the great garden ; so that , to escape , there be no way , but out of the window ; and of that window , because of the summer - parlour under it : for the other window be a great way from the ground . she say she be excessively frightened ; and instantly raise the Swiss , and the two maid , who lay not far off ; and find every door fast , she say , I must be carry away , as be out of prison , by some angel . it be a wonder she have not a worse thought ! she say , she weep , and wring she hand , and take on sadly , run about like a mad woman , little think I could have get out of the closet window , between the iron bars ; and , indeed , I do not know whether I could do so again . but at last find that casement open , they conclude it must be so ; and run out into the garden , and find my footstep in the mould of the bed which I dropt down upon from the lead : and so speed away all of they ; that be to say , , , and , towards the back - door , to see if that be fast ; while the cook be send to the out-office to raise the man , and make they get horsis ready , to take each a several way to pursue I . but , it seem , finde that door double - lock and padlock , and the heel of my shoe , and the broken brick , they verily conclude I be get away by some means over the wall ; and then , they say , see like a distracted woman : , at last , have the thought to go towards the pond : and there see my coat , and cap , and handkerchief , in the water , cast almost to the bank by the agitation of the wave , she think it be I ; and , scream out , run to , and say , o , madam , madam ! here be a piteous thing !-- . lie drown in the pond . Thither they all run ; and find my clothes , doubt not I be at the bottom ; and they all , swiss among the rest , beat they breast , and make most dismal lamentation ; and send to the man , to bid they get the drag - net ready , and leave the horse , and come to try to find the poor innocent ! as she , it seem , then call I , beat she breast , and lament my hard hap ; but most what would become of they , and what account they should give to my master . while every one be thus differently employ , some weeping and wailing , some run here and there , come into the wood - house ; and there lay poor I ; so weak , so low , and deject , and withal so stiff with my bruise , that I could not stir , nor help myself to get upon my foot . and I say , with a low voice , ( for I could hardly speak , ) ! . !-- the creature be sadly frightened , but be take up a billet to knock I on the head , believe I be some thief , as she say ; but I cry out , o , , help I , for pity 's sake , to ! for I can not get up !-- bless I , say she , what ! you , madam !-- why , we heart be almost broken , and we be go to drag the pond for you , believe you have drown yourself . now , say she , you will make we all alive again ! and , without help I , she run away to the pond , and bring all the crew to the wood - house .-- the wicked woman , as she enter ,
, say , where be she ?-- plague of she spell , and she witchcraft ! she shall dearly repent of this trick , if my name be Jewkes ; and , come to I , take hold of my arm so roughly , and give I such a pull , as make I squeal out , ( my shoulder be bruise on that side , ) and draw I on my face . of cruel creature ! say I , if you know what I have suffer , it would move you to pity I ! even seem to be concerned , and say , , madam , fie ! you see she be almost dead ! you must not be so rough with she . the coachman seem to be sorry for I too , and say , with sob , what a scene be here ! do not you see she be all bloody in she head , and can not stir ?-- curse of she contrivance ! say the horrid creature ; she have frightene I out of my wit , I be sure . how the d --- l come you here ?-- oh ! say I , ask I now no question , but let the maid carry I up to my prison ; and there let I die decently , and in peace ! for , indeed , I think I could not live two hour . the still more inhuman tigress say , I suppose you want to pray by you , do not you ? well , I will send for my master this minute : let he come and watch you himself , for I ; for there be no such thing as hold you , I be sure . so the maid take I up between they , and carry I to my chamber ; and when the wretch see how bad I be , she begin a little to relent -- while every one wonder ( at which I have neither strength nor inclination to tell they ) how all this come to pass , which they impute to sorcery and witchcraft . I be so weak , when I have get up stairs , that I faint away , with dejection , pain , and fatigue ; and they undress I , and get I to bed ; and order to bathe my shoulder , and arm , and ancle , with some old rum warm ; and they cut the hair a little from the back part of my head , and wash that ; for it be clot with blood , from a pretty long , but not a deep gash ; and put a family plaister upon it ; for , if this woman have any good quality , it be , it seem , in a readiness and skill to manage in case , where sudden misfortunes happen in a family . after this , I fall into a pretty sound and refresh sleep , and lay till twelve o'clock , tolerably easy , consider I be very feverish , and aguishly inclin ; and she take a deal of care to fit I to undergo more trial , which I have hope would have be happily end : but do not see fit . she would make I rise about twelve : but I be so weak , I could only sit up till the bed be make , and go into it again ; and be , as they say , delirious some part of the afternoon . but have a tolerable night on , I be a good deal better on , and on get up , and eat a little spoon - meat , and my feverishness seem to be go ; and I be so mende by evening , that I beg she indulgence in my closet , to be leave to myself ; which she consent to , it be double - barr the day before , and I assure she , that all my contrivance , as she call they , be at a end . but first she make I tell the whole story of my enterprise ; which I do very faithfully , know now that nothing could stand I in any stead , or contribute to my safety and escape : and she seem full of wonder at my resolution ; but tell I frankly , that I should have find it a hard matter to get quite off ; for that she be provide with a warrant from my master ( who be a justice of peace in this county as well as in the other ) to get I apprehend , if I have get away , on suspicion of wrong he , let I have be where I would . of how deep - laid be the mischief design to fall on my devoted head !-- surely , surely , I can not be worthy of all this contrivance ! this too well shew I the truth of what be hint to I formerly at the other house , that my master swore he would have I ! o preserve I , Heaven ! from be he , in he own wicked sense of the adjuration ! I must add , that now the woman see I pick up so fast , she use I worse , and have abridge I of paper , all but one sheet , which I be to show she , write or unwritten , on demand : and have reduce I to one pen : yet my hidden store stand I in stead . but she be more and more snappish and cross ; and tauntingly call I , and any thing she think will vex I . afternoon . have think fit to give I a airing , for three or four hour ,
, this afternoon ; and I be a good deal better and should be much more so , if I know for what I be reserve . but health be a blessing hardly to be covet in my circumstance , since that but expose I to the calamity I be in continual apprehension of ; whereas a weak and sickly state might possibly move compassion for I . of how I dread the coming of this angry and incense master ; though I be sure I have do he no harm ! just now we hear , that he have like to have be drown in cross the stream , a few day ago , in pursue he game . what be the matter , that with all he ill usage of I , I can not hate he ? to be sure , I be not like other people ! he have certainly do enough to make I hate he ; but yet , when I hear he danger , which be very great , I could not in my heart forbear rejoicing for he safety ; though he death would have end my affliction . Ungenerous master ! if you know this , you surely would not be so much my persecutor ! but , for my late good lady 's sake , I must wish he well ; and o what a angel would he be in my eye yet , if he would cease he attempt , and reform ! well , I hear by , that be turn away , be detect in writing to ; and that , and the butler , have incur he displeasure , for offer to speak in my behalf . too be in danger ; for all these three , probably , go together to beg in my favour ; for now it be know where I be . have , with the news about my master , receive a letter : but she say the contents be too bad for I to know . they must be bad indeed , if they be worse than what I have already know . just now the horrid creature tell I , as a secret , that she have reason to think he have find out a way to satisfy my scruple : it be , by marry I to this dreadful , and buy I of he on the wedding day , for a sum of money !-- be ever the like heard ?-- she say it will be my duty to obey my husband ; and that will be force , as a punishment , to marry we ; and that , when my master have pay for I , and I be surrendere up , the Swiss be to go home again , with the money , to he former wife and child ; for , she say , it be the custom of those people to have a wife in every nation . but this , to be sure , be horrid romancing ! yet , abominable as it be , it may possibly serve to introduce some plot now hatch ! -- with what strange perplexity be my poor mind agitate ! Perchance , some sham - marriage may be desig , on purpose to ruin I ; but can a husband sell he wife against she own consent ?-- and will such a bargain stand good in law ? , , , the 32 d , 33d , and 34th day of my imprisonment . nothing offer these day but squabbling between and I . she grow worse and worse to I . I vex she yesterday , because she talk nastily ; and tell she she talk more like a vile prostitute , than a gentleman 's housekeeper ; and she think she can not use I bad enough for it . bless I ! she curse and storms at I like a trooper , and can hardly keep she hand off I . you may believe she must talk sadly , to make I say such harsh word : indeed it can not be repeat ; as she be a disgrace to she sex . and then she ridicule I , and laugh at my notion of honesty ; and tell I , impudent creature as she be ! what a fine bed - fellow I shall make for my master ( and such - like ) , with such whimsical notion about I !-- do you think this be to be borne ? and yet she talk worse than this , if possible ! quite filthily ! of what vile hand be I put into ! . I have now all the reason that can be , to apprehend my master will be here soon ; for the servants be busy in set the house to right ; and a stable and coach - house be clean out , that have not be use some time . I ask ; but she tell I nothing , nor will hardly answer I when I ask she a question . sometimes I think she put on these strange wick airs to I , purposely to make I wish for , what I dread most of all thing , my master 's come down . he talk of love !-- if he have any the least notion of regard for I , to be sure he would not give this naughty body such power over I :-- and if he do come , where be he promise of not see I without I consent to it ? but , it seem , he honou owe I nothing ! so he tell I in he letter . and why ? because I be willing to keep mine . but , indeed , he say , he hate I perfectly : but it be plain he do ,
, or I should not be leave to the mercy of this woman : and , what be worse , to my woful apprehension . , the 36th day of my imprisonment . I take the liberty yesterday afternoon , find the gate open , to walk out before the house ; and , ere I be aware , have get to the bottom of the long row of elm ; and there I sit myself down upon the step of a sort of broad stile , which lead into the road , and go towards the town . and as I sit muse upon what always busy my mind , I see a whole body of folk run towards I from the house , man and woman , as in a fright . at first I wonder what be the matter , till they come nearer ; and I find they be all alarmed , think I have attempt to get off . there be first the horrible Colbrand , run with he long leg , well nigh two yard at a stride ; then there be one of the grooms , poor 's robber ; then I spy , half out of breath , and the cook - may after she ! and lastly , come waddling , as fast as she could , , exclaim most bitterly , as I find , against I . say , o how have you fright we all ! -- and go behind I , lest I should run away , as I suppose . I sit still , to let they see I have no view to get away ; for , besides the improbability of succeeding , my last sad attempt have cure I of enterprising again . and when come within hearing , I find she terribly incense , and rave about my contrivance . why , say I , should you be so concerned ? here I have sit a few minute , and have not the least thought of get away , or go farther ; but to return as soon as it be duskish . she would not believe I ; and the barbarous creature struck at I with she horrid fist , and , I believe , would have felle I , have not Colbrand interpose , and say , he see I sit still , look about I , and not seem to have the least inclination to stir . but this would not serve : she order the two maid to take I each by a arm , and lead I back into the house , and up stair ; and there have I be lock up ever since , without shoe . in vain have I plead , that I have no design , as indeed I have not the least ; and last night I be force to be between she and ; and I find she be resolve to make a handle of this against I , and in she own behalf .-- indeed , what with she usage , and my own apprehension of still worse , I be quite weary of my life . just now she have be with I , and give I my shoe , and have lay she imperious command upon I , to dress myself in a suit of clothes out of the portmanteau , which I have not see lately , against three or four o'clock ; for she say , she be to have a visit from 's two daughter , who come purposely to see I ; and so she give I the key of the portmanteau . but I will not obey she ; and I tell she , I would not be make a show of , nor see the lady . she leave I , say , it would be worse for I , if I do not . but how can that be ? five o'clock be come , and no young lady !-- so that I fancy -- but hold ! I hear they coach , I believe . I will step to the window .-- I will not go down to they , I be resolve -- good sir ! good sir ! what will become of I ! here be my master come in he fine chariot !-- indeed he be ! what shall I do ? where shall I hide myself ?--o ! what shall I do ? pray for I ! but oh ! you will not see this ! -- now , good of heaven , preserve I ; if it be thy bless will ! o'clock . though I dread to see he , yet do I wonder I have not . to be sure something be resolve against I , and he stay to hear all she story . I can hardly write ; yet , as I can do nothing else , I know not how to forbear ! -- yet I can not hold my pen -- how crook and trembl the line ! -- I must leave off , till I can get quieter finger !-- why should the guiltless tremble so , when the guilty can possess they mind in peace ? morning . now let I give you a account of what pass last night : for I have no power to write , nor yet opportunity till now . this vile woman hold my master till half a hour after seven ; and he come hither about five in the afternoon . and then I hear he voice on the stair , as he be come up to I . it be about he supper ; for he say , I shall choose a boiled chicken with butter and parsley .-- and up he come ! he put on a stern and majestic air ; and he can look very majestic when
when he please . well , perverse , ungrateful runaway , say he , for my first salutation !-- you do well , do not you , to give I all this trouble and vexation ! I could not speak ; but throw myself on the floor , hide my face , and be ready to die with grief and apprehension .-- he say , well may you hide you face ! well may you be asham to see I , vile forward one , as you be !-- I sob and weep , but could not speak . and he let I lie , and go to the door , and call .-- there , say he , take up that fall angel !-- once I think she as innocent as a angel of light but I have now no patience with she . the little hypocrite prostrate herself thus , in hope to move my weakness in she favour , and that I will raise she from the floor myself . but I shall not touch she : no , say he , cruel gentleman as he be ! let such fellow as be take in by she artful wile ! I know she now , and see she be for any fool 's turn , that will be catch by she . I sigh , as if my heart would break ! -- and lift I up upon my knee ; for I tremble so , I could not stand . come , say she , , learn to know you best friend ; confess you unworthy behaviour , and beg he honour 's forgiveness of all you fault . I be ready to faint : and he say , she be mistress of art , I will assure you ; and will mimic a fit , ten to one , in a minute . I be strike to the heart at this ; but could not speak presently ; only lift up my eye to heave !-- and at last make shift to say -- forgive you , sir !-- he see in a great passion , and walk up and down the room , cast sometimes a eye upon I , and seem as if he would have speak , but check himself -- and at last he say , when she have act this she first part over , perhaps I will see she again , and she shall soon know what she have to trust to . and so he go out of the room : and I be quite sick at heart !-- surely , say I , I be the wickedest creature that ever breathe ! well , say the impertinent , not so wicked as that neither ; but I be glad you begin to see you fault . nothing like be humble !-- come , I will stand you friend , and plead for you , if you will promise to be more dutiful for the future : come , come , add the wretch , this may be all make up by to - morrow morning , if you be not a fool .-- , hideous woman ! say I , and let not my affliction be add to by thy inexorable cruelty , and unwomanly wickedness . she give I a push , and go away in a violent passion : and it seem , she make a story of this ; and say , I have such a spirit , there be no bear it . I lay I down on the floor , and have no power to stir , till the clock struck nine : and then the wicked woman come up again . you must come down stairs , say she , to my master ; that be , if you please , spirit ! -- say I , I believe I can not stand . then , say she , I will send . to carry you down . I get up as well as I could , and tremble all the way down stair : and she go before I into the parlour ; and a new servant that he have wait on he , instead of , withdraw as soon as I come in : and , by the way , he have a new coachman too , which look as if be turn away . I think , say he , when I come down , you should have sit at table with I , when I have not company ; but when I find you can not forget you original , but must prefer my menial to I , I call you down to wait on I while I sup , that I may have some talk with you , and throw away as little time as possible upon you . , say I , you do I honou to wait upon you :-- and I never shall , I hope , forget my original . but I be force to stand behind he chair , that I might hold by it . fill I , say he , a glass of that . I go to do it , but my hand shook so , that I could not hold the plate with the glass in it , and spild some of the wine . so pour it for I , and I carry it as well as I could ; and make a low courtesy . he take it , and say , behind I , out of my sight ! why , , say he , you tell I she remain very sullen still , and eat nothing . no , say she , not so much as will keep life and soul together . -- and be always cry , you say , too ? yes , sir , answer she , I think she
she be , for one thing or another . ay , say he , you young wench will feed upon they tear ; and they obstinacy will serve they for meat and drink . I think I never see she look better though , in my life !-- but , I suppose , she live upon love . this sweet , and she little villanous plot together , have keep she alive and well , to be sure : for mischief , love , and contradiction , be the natural aliment of a woman . poor I be force to hear all this , and be silent ; and indeed my heart be too full to speak . and so you say , say he , that she have another project , but yesterday , to get away ? she deny it herself , say she ; but it have all the appearance of one . I be sure she make I in a fearful pucker about it : and I be glad you honour be come , with all my heart ; and I hope , whatever be you honour 's intention concern she , you will not be long about it ; for you will find she as slippery as a eel , I will assure you . , say I , and clasp he knee with my arm , not know what I do , and fal on my knee , have mercy on I , and hear I , concern that wicked woman 's usage of I -- he cruelly interrupt I , and say , I be satisfied she have do she duty : it signify nothing what you say against . that you be here , little hypocrite as you be , plead you cause before I , be owe to she care of you ; else you have be with the parson .-- Wick girl ! say he , to tempt a man to undue himself , as you have do he , at a time I be on the point of make he happy for he life ! I arise ; but say with a deep sigh , I have do , sir !-- I have do !-- I have a strange tribunal to plead before . the poor sheep in the fable have such a one ; when it be try before the vulture , on the accusation of the wolf ! so , , say he , you be the wolf , I the vulture , and this the poor innocent lamb on she trial before we .-- oh ! you do not know how well this innocent be read in reflection . she have wit at will , when she have a mind to display she own romantic innocence , at the price of other people 's character . well , say the aggravate creature , this be nothing to what she have call I : I have be a , a prostitute , and what not ?--But I be contente with she ill name , now I see it be she fashion , and she can call you honour a vulture . say I , I have no thought of compare my master -- and be go to say on : but he say , do not prate , girl !-- no , say she , it do not become you , I be sure . well , say I , since I must not speak , I will hold my peace ; but there be a righteous judge , who know the secret of all heart ; and to he I appeal . see there ! say he : now this meek , good creature be pray for fire from heaven upon we ! o she can curse most heartily , in the spirit of meekness , I will assure you !-- come , saucy - face , give I another glass of wine . so I do , as well as I could ; but wept so , that he say , I suppose I shall have some of you tear in my wine ! when he have sup , he stand up , and say , of how happy for you it be , that you can , at will , thus make you speak eye overflow in this manner , without lose any of they brilliancy ! you have be tell , I suppose , that you be most beautiful in you tear ! -- do you ever , say he to she , ( who all this while be stand in one corner of the parlour , ) see a more charming creature than this ? be it to be wonder at , that I demean myself thus to take notice of she ? -- , say he , and take the glass with one hand , and turn I round with the other , what a shape ! what a neck ! what a hand ! and what a bloom on that lovely face !-- but who can describe the trick and artifice , that lie lurking in she little , plotting , guileful heart ! ' Tis no wonder the poor parson be infatuate with she .-- I blame he less than I do she ; for who could expect such artifice in so young a sorceress ? I go to the farther part of the room , and hold my face against the wainscot ; and in spite of all I could do to refrain cry , sob as if my heart would break . he say , I be surprise , , at the mistake of the letter you tell I of ! but , you see , I be not afraid any body should read what I write . I do not carry on private correspondence , and reveal every secret that come to my knowledge , and then
then corrupt people to carry my letter against they duty , and all good conscience . come hither , hussy ! say he : you and I have a dreadful reckoning to make . why do not you come , when I bid you ?-- Fire upon it , , say she . what ! not stir , when he honour command you to come to he !-- who know but he goodness will forgive you ? he come to I , ( for I have no power to stir , ) and put he arm about my neck , and would kiss I ; and say , well , , if it be not for the thought of this curse parson , I believe in my heart , so great be my weakness , that I could not forgive this intrigue little slut , and take she to my bosom . o , say the sycophant , you be very good , sir , very forgiving , indeed !-- but come , add the profligate wretch , I hope you will be so good , as to take she to you bosom ; and that , by to - morrow morning , you will bring she to a better sense of she duty ! could any thing in womanhood be so vile ? I have no patience : but yet grief and indignation choak up the passage of my word ; and I could only stammer out a passionate exclamation to , to protect my innocence . but the word be the subject of they ridicule . be ever poor creature worse beset ! he say , as if he have be consider whether he could forgive I or not , no , I can not yet forgive she neither .-- she have give I great disturbance , have bring great discredit upon I , both abroad and at home : have corrupt all my servants at the other house ; have despise my honourable view and intention to she , and seek to run away with this ungrateful parson .-- and surely I ought not to forgive all this ! -- yet , with all this wretch grimace , he kiss I again , and would have put he hand into my bosom ; but I struggle , and say , I would die before I would be use thus .-- , , say he , in a threatening tone , consider where you be ! and do not play the fool : if you do , a more dreadful fate awaits you than you expect . but take she up stair , , and I will send a few line to she to consider of ; and let I have you answer , , in the morning . ' till then you have to resolve : and after that you doom be fix .-- so I go up stair , and give myself up to grief , and expectation of what he would send : but yet I be glad of this night 's reprieve ! he send I , however , nothing at all . and about twelve o'clock , and come up , as the night before , to be my bed - fellow : and I would go to be with some of my clothes on : which they mutter at sadly ; and rail at I particularly . indeed I would have sit up all night , for fear , if she would have let I . for I have but very little rest that night , apprehend this woman would let my master in . she do nothing but praise he , and blame I : but I answer she as little as I could . he have - tale , alias , to dine with he to - day , whose family send to welcome he into the country ; and it seem the old knight want to see I ; so I suppose I shall be send for , as be , to make sport for he .-- here I be , and must bear it all ! twelve o'clock , noon . just now he have send I up , by Jewkes , the follow proposal . so here be the honourable intentions all at once laid open . they be , my dear parent , to make I a vile keep mistress : which , I hope , I shall always detest the thought of . but you will see how they be accommodate to what I should have most desire , could I have honestly promote it , you welfare and happiness . I have answer they , as I be sure you will approve ; and I be prepare for the worst : for though I fear there will be nothing omit to ruin I , and though my poor strength will not be able to defend I , yet I will be innocent of crime in my intention , and in the sight of ; and to he leave the avenging of all my wrongs , time and manner . I shall write to you my answer against he article ; and hope the best , though I fear the worst . but if I should come home to you ruin and undone , and may not be able to look you in the face ; yet pity and inspirit the poor , to make she little remnant of life easy ; for long I shall not survive my disgrace : and you may be assure it shall not be my fault , if it be my misfortune . . . ' the follow article be propose to you serious consideration ; and let I have a answer , in writing , to they , that I may take my resolution accordingly . only remember , that I will not be trifle with ; and what
what you give for answer will absolutely decide you fate , without expostulation , or farther trouble . this be my answer . forgive , sir , the spirit you poor servant be about to show in she answer to you article . not to be warm , and in earnest , on such a occasion as the present , would show a degree of guilt , that , I hope , my soul abhor . I will not trifle with you , nor act like a person doubtful of she own mind ; for it want 's not one moment 's consideration with I ; and I therefore return the answer follow , let what will be the consequence . 'i . if you can convince I that the hate parson have have no encouragement from you in he address ; and that you have no inclination for he in preference to I ; then I will offer the follow proposal to you , which I will punctually make good . I . as to the first article , sir , it may behove I ( that I may not deserve , in you opinion , the opprobrious term of forward and artful , and such like ) to declare solemnly , that never have the least encouragement from I , as to what you hint ; and I believe he principal motive be the apprehend duty of he function , quite contrary to he apparent interest , to assist a person he think in distress . you may , sir , the rather believe I , when I declare , that I know not the man breathe I would wish to marry ; and that the only one I could honour more than another , be the gentleman , who , of all other , seek my everlasting dishonour . 'ii . I will directly make you a present of 500 guinea , for you own use , which you may dispose of to any purpose you please : and will give it absolutely into the hand of any person you shall appoint to receive it ; and expect no favour in return , till you be satisfied in the possession of it . ii . as to you second proposal , let the consequence be what it will , I reject it with all my soul . money , sir , be not my chief good : desert I , whenever it be ! and whenever , for the sake of that , I can give up my title to that bless hope which will stand I in stead , at a time when million of gold will not purchase one happy moment of reflection on a past misspent life ! 'iii . I will likewise directly make over to you a purchase I lately make in , which bring in 250 l . per annum , clear of all deduction . this shall be make over to you in full property for you life , and for the life of any child to perpetuity , that you may happen to have : and you father shall be immediately put into possession of it in trust for these purpose : and the management of it will yield a comfortable subsistence to he , and you mother , for life ; and I will make up any deficiency , if such should happen , to that clear sum , and allow he 50 l . per annum , besides , for he life , and that of you mother , for he care and management of this you estate . iii . you third proposal , sir , I reject for the same reason ; and be sorry you could think my poor honest parent would enter into they part of it , and be concerned for the management of a estate , which would be owe to the prostitution of they poor daughter . forgive , sir , my warmth on this occasion ; but you know not the poor man , and the poor woman , my ever - dear father and mother , if you think , that they would not much rather choose to starve in a ditch , or rot in a noisome dungeon , than accept of the fortune of a monarch , upon such wicked term . I dare not say all that my full mind suggest to I on this grievous occasion -- but , indeed , sir , you know they not ; nor shall the terror of death , in its most frightful form , I hope , through 's assist , ever make I act unworthy of such poor honest parent ! . I will , moreover , extend my favour to any other of you relation , that you may think worthy of it , or that be value by you . iv . you fourth proposal , I take upon I , sir , to answer as the third . if I have any friend that want the favour of the great , may they ever want it , if they be capable of desire it on unworthy term ! . I will , besides , order pattern to be send you for choose four complete suit of rich clothes , that you may appear with reputation , as if you be my wife . and will give you the two diamond ring , and two pair of ear - ring , and diamond necklace , that be buy by my mother , to present to , if the match that be propose between she and I have be bring to effect : and I will confer upon you still other gratuity , as I shall find myself oblige , by you good behaviour and affection . . clothes , sir , become not I ; nor have I any ambition to wear they . I
I have greater pride in my poverty and meanness , than I should have in dress and finery . believe I , sir , I think such thing less become the humble - bear , than the rag you good mother raise I from . you ring , sir , you necklace , and you ear - ring , will better befit lady of degree , than I : and to lose the best jewel , my virtue , would be poorly recompense by those you propose to give I . what should I think , when I look upon my finger , or see in the glass those diamonds on my neck , and in my ear , but that they be the price of my honesty ; and that I wear those jewel outwardly , because I have none inwardly . 'vi . now , , will you see by this , what a value I set upon the free - will of a person already in my power ; and who , if these proposal be not accept , shall find , that I have not take all these pain , and risk my reputation , as I have do , without resolve to gratify my passion for you , at all adventur ; and if you refuse , without make any term at all . . I know , sir , by woful experience , that I be in you power : I know all the resistance I can make will be poor and weak , and , perhaps , stand I in little stead : I dread you will to ruin I be as great as you power : yet , sir , will I dare to tell you , that I will make no free - will offer of my virtue . all that I can do , poor as it be , I will do , to convince you , that you offer shall have no part in my choice ; and if I can not escape the violence of man , I hope , by 's , I shall have nothing to reproach myself , for not do all in my power to avoid my disgrace ; and then I can safely appeal to the great , my only refuge and protector , with this consolation , that my will bear no part in my violation . ' . you shall be mistress of my person and fortune , as much as if the foolish ceremony have pass . all my servant shall be yours ; and you shall choose any two person to attend yourself , either male or female , without any control of mine : and if you conduct be such , that I have reason to be satisfied with it , I know not ( but will not engage for this ) that I may , after a twelvemonth 's cohabitation , marry you ; for , if my love increase for you , as it have do for many month past , it will be impossible for I to deny you any thing . ' and now , , consider well , it be in you power to oblige I on such term , as will make yourself , and all you friend , happy : but this will be over this very day , irrevocably over ; and you shall find all you would be think to fear , without the least benefit arise from it to yourself . ' and I beg you will well weigh the matter , and comply with my proposal ; and I will instantly set about securing to you the full effect of they : and let I , if you value yourself , experience a grateful return on this occasion , and I will forgive all that be past . ' Vii . I have not once da to look so high , as to such a proposal as you seventh article contain . hence have proceed all my little abortive artifice to escape from the confinement you have put I in ; although you promise to be honourable to I . you honour , well I know , would not let you stoop to so mean and so unworthy a slave , as the poor Pamela : all I desire be , to be permit to return to my native meanness unviolated . what have I do , sir , to deserve it should be otherwise ? for the obtaining of this , though I would not have marry you chaplain , yet would I have run away with you meanest servant , if I have think I could have get safe to my beloved poverty . I hear you once say , sir , that a certain great commander , who could live upon lentil , might well refuse the bribe of the greatest monarch : and I hope , as I can contentedly live at the meanest rate , and think not myself above the lowest condition , that I be also above make a exchange of my honesty for all the riche of the Indy . when I come to be proud and vain of gaudy apparel , and outside finery , then ( which I hope will never be ) may I rest my principal good in such vain trinket , and despise for they the more solid ornament of a good fame , and a chastity inviolate ! give I leave to say , sir , in answer to what you hint , that you may in a twelvemonth 's time marry I , on the continuance of my good behaviour ; that this weigh less with I , if possible , than any thing else you have say : for , in the first place , there be a end of all merit , and all good behaviour , on my side ,
, if I have now any , the moment I consent to you proposal : and I should be so far from expect such a honour , that I will pronounce , that I should be most unworthy of it . what , sir , would the world say , be you to marry you harlot ? that a gentleman of you rank in life should stoop , not only to the base - bear , but to a base - bear prostitute ?-- little , sir , as I know of the world , I be not to be catch by a bait so poorly cover as this ! yet , after all , dreadful be the thought , that I , a poor , weak , friendless , unhappy creature , be too full in you power ! but permit I , sir , to pray , as I now write on my bended knee , that before you resolve upon my ruin , you will weigh well the matter . , sir , though you have take large stride to this cry sin , yet be you on this side the commission of it .-- when once it be do , nothing can recall it ! and where will be you triumph ?-- what glory will the spoils of such a weak enemy yield you ? let I but enjoy my poverty with honesty , be all my prayer , and I will bless you , and pray for you , every moment of my life ! , of think ! before it be yet too late ! what sting , what remorse will attend you dying hour , when you come to reflect , that you have ruin , perhaps soul and body , a wretch creature , whose only pride be she virtue ! and how pleased you will be , on the contrary , if in that tremendous moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this foul crime , and to plead in you own behalf , that you suffer the earnest supplication of a unhappy wretch to prevail with you to be innocent yourself , and let she remain so !-- , whose mercy so lately save you from the peril of perishing in deep water , ( on which , I hope , you will give I cause to congratulate you ! ) touch you heart in my favour , and save you from this sin , and I from this ruin !-- and to he do I commit my cause ; and to he will I give the glory , and night and day pray for you , if I may be permit to escape this great evil !---- you poor oppress , break spirited servant . I take a copy of this for you perusal , my dear parent , if I shall ever be so happy to see you again ; ( for I hope my conduct will be approve of by you ;) and at night , when be gone , he send for I down . well , say he , have you consider my proposal ? yes , sir , say I , I have : and there be my answer : but pray let I not see you read it . be it you bashfulness , say he , or you obstinacy , that make you not choose I should read it before you ? I offer to go away ; and he say , do not run from I ; I will not read it till you be gone . but , say he , tell I , , whether you comply with my proposal , or not ? , say I , you will see presently ; pray do not hold I ; for he take my hand . say he , do you well consider before you answer ?-- I do , sy , say I . if it be not what you think will please I , say he , dear girl , take it back again , and reconsider it ; for if I have this as you absolute answer , and I do not like it , you be undone ; for I will not sue meanly , where I can command . I fear , say he , it be not what I like , by you manner : and let I tell you , that I can not bear denial . if the term I have offer be not sufficient , I will augment they to two - third of my estate ; for , say he , and swore a dreadful oath , I can not live without you : and , since the thing be go so far , I will not ! and so he clasp I in he arm in such a manner as quite frightene I ; and kiss I two or three time . I get from he , and run up stair , and go to the closet , and be quite uneasy and fearful . in a hour 's time he call down to he ! and I hear he very high in passion : and all about I ! and I hear she say , it be he own fault ; there would be a end of all my complaining and perverseness , if he be once resolve ; and other most impudent aggravation . I be resolve not to go to be this night , if I can help it !-- lie still , lie still , my poor fluttering heart !-- what will become of I ! almost twelve o'clock , night . he send , about ten o'clock , to tell I to come to he . where ? say I . I will show you , say she . I go down three or four step , and see she make to he
he chamber , the door of which be open : so I say , I can not go there !-- do not be foolish , say she ; but come ; no harm will be do to you !-- well , say I , if I die , I can not go there . I hear he say , let she come , or it shall be worse for she . I can not bear , say he , to speak to she myself !-- well , say I , I can not come , indeed I cannot ; and so I go up again into my closet , expect to be fetch by force . but she come up soon after , and bid I make haste to be : say I , I will not go to be this night , that be certain !-- then , say she , you shall be make to come to be ; and and I will undress you . I know neither prayer nor tear would move this wicked woman : so I say , I be sure you will let master in , and I shall be undone ! Mighty piece of undone ! she say : but he be too much exasperate against I , to be so familiar with I , she would assure I !-- ay , say she , you will be dispose of another way soon , I can tell you for you comfort : and I hope you husband will have you obedience , though nobody else can have it . no husband in the world , say I , shall make I do a unjust or base thing .-- she say , that would be soon try ; and come in , what ! say I , be I to have two bed - fellow again , these warm night ? yes , say she , slippery - one , you be , till you can have one good one instead of we . say I , , do not talk nastily to I : I see you be begin again ; and I shall affro not you , may be ; for next to bad action , be bad word ; for they could not be spoken , if they be not in the heart .-- come to bed , purity ! say she . you be a nonsuch , I suppose . indeed , say I , I can not come to be ; and it will do you no harm to let I stay all night in the great chair . , say she , undress my young lady . if she will not let you , I will help you ; and , if neither of we can do it quietly , we will call my master to do it for we ; though , say she , I think it a office worthier of ! -- you be very wicked , say I . I know it , say she ; I be a , and a prostitute , you know . you do great feat , say I , to tell my master all this poor stuff ; but you do not tell he how you beat I . no , lambkin , say she , ( a word I have not hear a good while , ) that I leave for you to tell and you be go to do it if the vulture have not take the wolf 's part , and bid the poor innocent lamb be silent ! -- ay , say I , no matter for you fleer , Jewkes ; though I can have neither justice nor mercy here , and can not be hear in my defence , yet a time will come , may be , when I shall be hear , and when you own guilt will strike you dumb .-- ay ! spirit , say she ; and the vulture too ! must we both be dumb ? why that , lambkin , will be pretty !-- then , say the wicked one , you will have all the talk to yourself !-- then how will the tongue of the pretty lambkin bleat out innocence , and virtue , and honesty , till the whole trial be at a end ! -- you be a wicked woman , that be certain , say I ; and if you think any thing of another world , could not talk thus . but no wonder !-- it shew what hand I be get into ! -- ay , so it do , say she ; but I beg you will undress , and come to be , or I believe you innocence will not keep you from still worse hands . I will come to bed , say I , if you will let I have the key in my own hand ; not else , if I can help it . yes , say she , and then , hey for another contrivance , another escape !-- no , no , say I , all my contrivance be over , I will assure you ! pray let I have the key , and I will come to be . she come to I , and take I in she huge arm , as if I be a feather : say she , I do this to show you what a poor resistance you can make against I , if I please to exert myself ; and so , lambkin , do not say to you wolf , I will not come to be !-- and set I down , and tap I on the neck : ah ! say she , thou be a pretty creature , ' ttis true ; but so obstinate ! so full of spirit ! if thy strength be but answerable to that ,
, thou would 'st run away with we all , and this great house too on thy back !-- but , undress , undress , I tell you . well , say I , I see my misfortune make you very merry , and very witty too : but I will love you , if you will humour I with the key of the chamber -door .-- be you sure you will love I ? say she : now speak you conscience !-- why , say I , you must not put it so close ; neither would you , if you think you have not give reason to doubt it ! -- but I will love you as well as I can !-- I would not tell a wilful lie : and if I do , you would not believe I , after you hard usage of I . well , say she , that be all fair , I own !-- but , pray pull off my young lady 's shoe and stocking .-- no , pray do not , say I ; I will come to be presently , since I must . and so I go to the closet , and scribble a little about this idle chit - chat . and she be importunate , I be force to go to bed ; but with some of my clothes on , as the former night ; and she let I hold the two key ; for there be two lock , there be a double door ; and so I get a little sleep that night , have have none for two or three night before . I can not imagine what she mean ; but offer to talk a little once or twice ; and she snub she , and say , I charge you , wench , do not open you lip before I ; and if you be ask any question by , do not answer she one word , while I be here ! -- but she be a lordly woman to the maid - servant ; and that have always be she character : of how unlike good in every thing . morning . a thought come into my head ; I mean no harm ; but it be a little bold . for , see my master dress to go to church ; and he chariot get ready , I go to my closet , and I writ , the prayer of this congregation be earnestly desire for a gentleman of great worth and honour , who labour under a temptation to exert he great power to ruin a poor , distressed , worthless maiden : and also , the prayer of this congregation be earnestly desire by a poor distressed creature , for the preservation of she virtue and innocence . come up : write ! say she ; and would see it : and strait , all that ever I could say , carry it down to my master .-- he look upon it , and say , tell she , she shall soon see how she prayer be answer ; she be very bold : but as she have reject all my favour , she reckon for all be not far off . I look after he out of the window ; and he be charmingly dress : to be sure he be a handsome fine gentleman ! -- what pity he heart be not as good as he appearance ! why can not I hate he ? --but do not be uneasy , if you should see this ; for it be impossible I should love he ; for he vice all ugly he over , as I may say . my master send word , that he shall not come home to dinner : I suppose he dine with this . I be much concerned for poor . say , he be confine still , and take on much . all he trouble be brotch upon he for my sake : this grieve I much . my master , it seem , will have he money from he . this be very hard ; for it be three fifty pound , he give he , as he think , as a salary for three year that he have be with he : but there be no agreement between they ; and he absolutely depend on my master 's favour . to be sure , it be the more generous of he to run these risk for the sake of oppress innocence : and I hope he will meet with he reward in due time . Alas for I ! I dare not plead for he ; that would raise my oppressor 's jealousy more . and I have not interest to save myself ! evening . have receive a line from my master : I wonder what it be , for he chariot be come home without he . but she will tell I nothing ; so it be in vain to ask she . I be so fearful of plot and trick , I know not what to do !-- every thing I suspect ; for , now my disgrace be avow , what can I think !-- to be sure , the worst will be attempte ! I can only pour out my soul in prayer to , for he blessed protection . but , if I must suffer , let I not be long a mournful survivor !-- only let I not shorten my own time sinfully !---- this woman leave upon the table , in the chamber , this letter of my master 's to she ; and I bolt myself in , till I have transcribe it . you will see how tremblingly , by the line . I wish poor 's release at any rate ; but this letter
letter make my heart ache . yet I have another day 's reprieve , thank ! ' Mr . Jewkes , 'I have be so press on 's affair , that I shall set out this afternoon , in 's chariot , and with , who be he intercessor , for ; and shall not be back till to - morrow evening , if then . as to you ward , I be thoroughly incense against she : she have withstand she time ; and now , would she sign and seal to my article , it be too late . I shall discover something , perhaps , by he ; and will , on my return , let she know , that all she ensnar loveliness shall not save she from the fate that await she . but let she know nothing of this , lest it put she fruitful mind upon plot and artifice . be sure trust she not without another with you at night , lest she venture the window in she foolish rashness : for I shall require she at you hand . ' yours , etc . ' I have but just finish take a copy of this , and lay the letter where I have it , and unbolt the door , when she come up in a great fright , for fear I should have see it ; but I be in my closet , and that lie as she leave it , she do not mistrust . o , say she , I be afraid you have see my master 's letter here , which I carelessly leave on the table . I wish , say I , I have know that . why sure , say she , if you have , you would not have offer to read my letter ! indeed , say I , I should , at this time , if it have be in my way :-- do let I see it .-- well , say she , I wish poor well off : I understand my master be gone to make up matter with he ; which be very good . to be sure , add she , he be a very good gentleman , and very forgive !-- why , say I , as if I have know nothing of the matter , how can he make up matter with he ? be not at ? yes , say she , I believe so ; but plead for he , and he be go with he to , and will not be back to - night : so we have nothing to do , but to eat we supper betime , and go to bed . ay , that be pure , say I ; and I shall have good rest this night , I hope . so , say she , you might every night , but for you own idle fear . you be afraid of you friend , when none be near you . ay , that be true , say I ; for I have not one near I . so I have one more good honest night before I : what the next may be I know not , and so I will try to take in a good deal of sleep , while I can be a little easy . therefore , here I say , good night , my dear parent ; for I have no more to write about this night : and though he letter shock I , yet I will be as brisk as I can , that she may not suspect I have see it . night . for the future , I will always mistrust most when appearance look fairest . of you poor daughter ! what have she not suffer since what I write on night !-- my worst trial , and my fearfullest danger ! of how I shudder to write you a account of this wicked interval of time ! for , my dear parent , will you not be too much frightene and affect with my distress , when I tell you , that he journey to be all abominable pretence ! for he come home privately , and have well nigh effect all he vile purpose , and the ruin of you poor daughter ! and that by such a plot as I be not in the least apprehensive of : and , oh ! you will hear what a vile and unwomanly part that wick wretch , , act in it ! I leave off with let you know how much I be pleased that I have one night 's reprieve add to my honesty . but I have less occasion to rejoice than ever , as you will judge by what I have say already . take , then , the dreadful story , as well as I can relate it . the maid be a little apt to drink , if she can get at liquor ; and happen , or design , as be too probable , to leave a bottle of cherry - brandy in she way , and the wench drank some of it more than she should ; and when she come in to lay the cloth , perceive it , and fall a rating at she most sadly ; for she have too many fault of she own , to suffer any of the like sort in any body else , if she can help it ; and she bid she get out of she sight , when we have sup , and go to bed , to sleep off she liquor , before we come to bed . and so the poor maid go mutter up stair . about two hour after , which be near eleven o'clock , and I go up to go to bed ;
; I please myself with what a charme night I should have . we lock both door , and see poor , as I think , ( but , oh ! 'tbe my abominable master , as you shall hear by and by , ) sit fast asleep , in a elbow - chair , in a dark corner of the room , with she apron throw over she head and neck . and say , there be that beast of a wench fast asleep , instead of be a - bed ! I know , say she , she have take a fine dose . I will wake she , say I . no , do not , say she ; let she sleep on ; we shall he better without she . ay , say I , so we shall ; but will not she get cold ? say she , I hope you have no writing to - night . no , reply I , I will go to be with you , . say she , I wonder what you can find to write about so much ! and be sure you have better conveniences of that kind , and more paper than I be aware of ; and I have intend to rummage you , if my master have not come down ; for I spy a broken tea - cup with ink , which give I suspicion : but as he be come , let he look after you , if he will ; and if you deceive he , it will be he own fault . all this time we be undressing ourselves : and I fetch a deep sigh ! what do you sigh for ? say she . I be think , , answer I , what a sad life I live , and how hard be my lot . I be sure , the thief that have rob be much better off than I , ' bat the guilt ; and I should , I think , take it for a mercy , to be hang out of the way , rather than live in these cruel apprehension . so , be not sleepy , and in a prattling vein , I begin to give a little history of myself , as I do , once before , to ; in this manner : here , say I , be my poor honest parent ; they take care to instill good principle into my mind , till I be almost twelve year of age ; and teach I to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of life ; and they confirm they lesson by they own practice ; for they be , of late year , remarkably poor , and always as remarkably honest , even to a proverb : for , as honest as goodman , be a byeword . well then , say I , come my late dear good lady , and take a fancy to I , and say , she would be the making of I , if I be a good girl ; and she put I to s , to dance , to play on the spinnet , in order to divert she melancholy hour ; and also teach I all manner of fine needle - work ; but still this be she lesson , my good Pamela , be virtuous , and keep the man at a distance . well , so I be , I hope , and so I do ; and yet , though I say it , they all love I and respecte I ; and would do any thing for I , as if I be a gentlewoman . but , then , what come next ?-- why , it please to take my good lady : and then come my master : and what say he ?-- why , in effect , it be , be not virtuous , . so here I have live about sixteen year in virtue and reputation ; and all at once , when I come to know what be good , and what be evil , I must renounce all the good , all the whole sixteen year ' innocence , which , next to 's , I owed chiefly to my parent , and my lady 's good lesson and example , and choose the evil ; and so , in a moment 's time , become the vilest of creature ! and all this , for what , I pray ? why , truly , for a pair of diamond ear - ring , a necklace , and a diamond ring for my finger ; which would not become I : for a few paltry fine clothes , which , when I wear they , would make but my former poverty more ridiculous to every body that see I ; especially when they know the base term I wear they upon . but , indeed , I be to have a great parcel of guinea beside ; I forget how many ; for , have there be ten time more , they would have be not so much to I , as the honest six guinea you tricke I out of , . well , forsooth ! but then I be to have I know not how many pound a year for my life ; and my poor father ( there be the jest of it ! ) be to be the manager for the abandoned prostitute he daughter : and then , ( there be the jest again ! ) my kind , forgive , virtuous master , would pardon I all my misdeed ! yes , thank he for nothing , truly . and what , pray , be all these violent misdeed ?--Why , they be for daring to adhere to the good lesson
lesson that be teach I ; and not learn a new one , that would have reverse all my former : for not be content when I be run away with , in order to be ruin ; but contrive , if my poor wit have be able , to get out of danger , and preserve myself honest . then be he once jealous of poor , though he know be he own creature , and help to deceive I . then be he outrageous against poor ! and he have this good , merciful master , throw into gaol ; and for what ? why , truly , for that , be a divine , and a good man , he have the fear of before he eye , and be willing to forego all he expectation of interest , and assist a oppress poor creature . but , to be sure , I must be forward , bold , saucy , and what not ! to dare to run away from certain ruin , and to strive to escape from a unjust confinement ; and I must be marry to the parson , nothing so sure ! he would have have but a poor catch of I , have I consent : but he , and you too , know I do not want to marry any body . I only want to go to my poor parent , and to have my own liberty , and not to be confine by such a unlawful restraint ; and which would not have be inflict upon I , but only that I be a poor , destitute , young body , and have no friend that be able to right I . so , , say I , here be my history in brief . and I be a very unhappy young creature , to be sure !-- and why be I so ?-- why , because my master see something in my person that take he present fancy ; and because I would not be undone .-- why , therefore to choose , I must , and I shall be undone !-- and this be all the reason that can be give ! she hear I run on all this time , while I be undressing , without any interruption ; and I say , well , I must go to the two closet , ever since a affair of the closet at the other house , though he be so far off . and I have a good mind to wake this poor maid . no , do not , say she , I charge you . I be very angry with she , and she will get no harm there ; and if she wake , she may come to be well enough , as long as there be a candle in the chimney . so I look into the closet , and knee down in my own , as I use to do , to say my prayer , and this with my underclothes in my hand , all undressed ; and pass by the poor sleeping wench , as I think , in my return . but , oh ! little do I think it be my wicked , wicked master , in a gown and petticoat of hers , and she apron over he face and shoulders . what meanness will not Lucifer make he votary stoop to , to gain they abominable end ! , by this time , be get to bed , on the farther side , as she use to be ; and , to make room for the maid , when she should awake , I get into bed , and lay close to she . and I say , where be the key ? though , say I , I be not so much afraid to - night . here , say the wicked woman , put you arm under mine , and you shall find they about my wrist , as they use to be . so I do , and the abominable designer hold my hand with she right - hand , as my right - arm be under she left . in less than a quarter of a hour , I say , there be poor awake ; I hear she stir . let we go to sleep , say she , and not mind she : she will come to be , when she be quite awake . poor soul ! say I , I will warrant she will have the head - ache finely to - morrow for this ! be silent , say she , and go to sleep ; you keep I awake ; and I never find you in so talkative a humour in my life . do not chide I , say I ; I will but say one thing more : do you think could hear I talk of my master 's offer ? no , no , say she ; she be dead asleep . I be glad of that , say I ; because I would not expose my master to he common servants ; and I know you be no stranger to he fine article . say she , I think they be fine article , and you be bewitch you do not close with they : but let we go to sleep . so I be silent ; and the pretended ( of wicked , base , villanous designer ! what a plot , what a unexpected plot be this ! ) seem to be awak ; and , abhorrent creature ! say , , !-- what , be you awake at last ?-- Pr'ythee come to be ; for be in a talk fit , and will not go to sleep one while . at that , the pretend she come to
to the bed side ; and , sit down in a chair , where the curtain hide she , begin to undress . say I , poor , I warrant you head ach most sadly ! how do you do ? say he , one word with you , Pamela ; one word hear I but ; I must say one word to you , it be this : you see now you be in my power !-- you can not get from I , nor help yourself : yet have I not offer any thing amiss to you . but if you resolve not to comply with my proposal , I will not lose this opportunity : if you do , I will yet leave you . of sir , say I , leave I , leave I but , and I will do any thing I ought to do .-- swear then to I , say he , that you will accept my proposal ! with struggling , fright , terror , I faint away quite , and do not come to myself soon , so that they both , from the cold sweat that I be in , think I die . -- and I remember no more , than that , when with great difficulty they bring I to myself , she be sit on one side of the bed , with she clothes on ; and he on the other with he , and in he gown and slipper . you poor can not answer for the libertie take with she in she deplorable state of death . and when I see they there , I sit up in my bed , without any regard to what appearance i make , and nothing about my neck ; and he soothe I , with a aspect of pity and concern , I put my hand to he mouth , and say , o tell I , yet tell I not , what have I suffer in this distress ? and I talk quite wild , and know not what : for , to be sure , I be on the point of distraction . he most solemnly , and with a bitter imprecation , vow , that he have not offer the least indecency ; that he be frightene at the terrible manner I be take with the fit : that he should desist from he attempt ; and beg but to see I easy and quiet , and he would leave I directly , and go to he own bed . of then , say I , take with you this most wicked woman , this vile , as a earnest , that I may believe you ! and will you , sir , say the wicked wretch , for a fit or two , give up such a opportunity as this ?-- I think you have know the sex better . she be now , you see , quite well again ! this I hear ; more she might say ; but I faint away once more , at these word , and at he clasp he arm about I again . and , when I come a little to myself , I see he sit there , and the maid , hold a smelling - bottle to my nose , and no . he say , take my hand , now will I vow to you , my dear Pamela , that I will leave you the moment I see you better , and pacify . here be know , and will tell you , my concern for you . I vow to , I have not offer any indecency to you : and , since I find Jewkes so offensive to you , I have send she to the maid 's bed , and the maid shall be with you to - night . and but promise I , that you will compose yourself , and I will leave you . but , say I , will not Nan also hold my hand ? and will not she let you come in again to I ?-- he say , by heaven ! I will not come in again to - night . Nan , undress yourself , go to bed , and do all you can to comfort the dear creature : and now , , say he , give I but you hand , and say you forgive I , and I will leave you to you repose . I hold out my trembling hand , which he vouchsaf to kiss ; and I say , forgive you , sir , as you have be just in my distress ; and as you will be just to what you promise ! and he withdraw , with a countenance of remorse , as I hope ; and she shut the door , and , at my request , bring the key to bed . this , of my dear parent ! be a most dreadful trial . I tremble still to think of it ; and dare not recall all the horrid circumstance of it . I hope , as he assure I , he be not guilty of indecency ; but have reason to bless , who , by disabl I in my faculty , empower I to preserve my innocence ; and , when all my strength would have signify nothing , magnify himself in my weakness . I be so weak all day on , that I could not get out of my bed . my master shew great tenderness for I ; and I hope he be really sorry , and that this will be he last attempt ; but he do not say so neither . he come in the morning , as soon as he hear the door open and I begin to be fearful . he
he stop short of the bed , and say , Rather than give you apprehension , I will come no farther . I say , you honour , sir , and you mercy , be all I have to beg . he sit himself on the side of the bed , and ask kindly , how I do ?-- beg I to be compose ; say , I still look a little wildly . and I say , , good sir , let I not see this infamous ; I doubt I can not bear she sight . she sha not come near you all this day , if you will promise to compose yourself . then , sir , I will try . he press my hand very tenderly , and go out . what a change do this shew !-- o may it be last !-- but , alas ! he seem only to have alte he method of proceeding ; and retain , I doubt , he wick purpose . on , about ten o'clock , when my master hear I be up , he send for I down into the parlour . as soon as he see I , he say , come nearer to I , . I do so , and he take my hand , and say , you begin to look well again : I be glad of it . you little slut , how do you frighten I on night . , say I , pray name not that night ; and my eye overflow at the remembrance , and I turn my head aside . say he , place some little confidence in I : I know what those charme eye mean , and you shall not need to explain yourself : for I do assure you , that as soon as I see you change , and a cold sweat bedew you pretty face , and you faint away , I quit the bed , and do so too . and I put on my gown , and she fetch she smell - bottle , and we both do all we could to restore you ; and my passion for you be all swallow up in the concern I have for you recovery ; for I think I never see a fit so strong and violent in my life : and fear we should not bring you to life again ; for what I see you in once before be nothing to it . this , say he , might be my folly , and my unacquaintedness with what passion you sex can show when they be in earnest . but this I repeat to you , that you mind may be entirely comfort -- whatever I offer to you , be before you faint away , and that , I be sure , be innocent . , say I , that be very bad : and it be too plain you have the worst designs . when , say he , I tell you the truth in one instance , you may believe I in the other . I know not , I declare , beyond this lovely bosom , you sex : but that I do intend what you call the worst be most certain : and though I would not too much alarm you now , I could curse my weakness , and my folly , which make I own , that I love you beyond all you sex , and can not live without you . but if I be master of myself , and my own resolution , I will not attempt to force you to any thing again . , say I , you may easily keep you resolution , if you will send I out of you way , to my poor parent ; that be all I beg . ' tTis a folly to talk of it , say he . you must not , shall not go ! and if I could be assure you would not attempt it , you should have better usage , and you confinement should be make easier to you . but to what end , sir , be I to stay ? say I : you yourself seem not sure you can keep you own present good resolution ; and do you think , if I be to stay , when I could get away , and be safe , it would not look , as if either I confide too much in my own strength , or would tempt my ruin ? and as if I be not in earnest to wish myself safe , and out of danger ?-- and then , how long be I to stay ? and to what purpose ? and in what light must I appear to the world ? would not that censure I , although I might be innocent ? and you will allow , sir , that , if there be any thing valuable or exemplary in a good name , or fair reputation , one must not despise the world 's censure , if one can avoid it . well , say he , I send not for you on this account , just now ; but for two reason . the first be , that you promise I , that for a fortnight to come you will not offer to go away without my express consent ; and this I expect for you own sake , that I may give you a little more liberty . and the second be , that yoyou will see and forgive : she take on much , and think that , as all she fault be she obedience to I , it would be very hard to sacrifice she , as she call it , to you resentment . as to the first , sir , say
say I , it be a hard injunction , for the reason I have mention . and as to the second , consider she vile , unwomanly wickedness , and she endeavour to instigate you more to ruin I , when you return goodness seem to have some compassion upon I , it be still harder . but , to show my obedience to you command , ( for you know , my dear parent , I might as well make a merit of my compliance , when my refusal would stand I in no stead , ) I will consent to both ; and to every thing else , that you shall be pleased to enjoin , which I can do , with innocence . that be my good girl ! say he , and kiss I : this be quite prudent , and shew I , that you do not take insolent advantage of my favour for you ; and will , perhaps , stand you in more stead than you be aware of . so he ring the bell , and say , call down . she come down , and he take my hand , and put it into hers ; and say , . Jewkes , I be oblige to you for all you diligence and fidelity to I ; but , I must own , be not ; because the service I employ you in be not so very obliging to she , as I could have wish she would have think it : and you be not to favour she , but obey I . but yet I will assure you , at the very first word , she have once oblige I , by consent to be friend with you ; and if she give I no great cause , I shall not , perhaps , put you on such disagreeable service again .-- now , therefore , be you once more bed - fellow and board - fellow , as I may say , for some day longer ; and see that send no letter nor message out of the house , nor keep a correspondence unknown to I , especially with that ; and , as for the rest , show the dear girl all the respect that be due to one I must love , if she will deserve it , as I hope she will yet ; and let she be under no unnecessary or harsh restraint . but you watchful care be not , however , to cease : and remember that you be not to disoblige I , to oblige she ; and that I will not , can not , yet part with she . look very sullen , and as if she would be glad still to do I a good turn , if it lay in she power . I take courage then to drop a word or two for poor ; but he be angry with I for it , and say he could not endure to hear he name in my mouth ; so I be force to have do for that time . all this time , my papers , that I bury under the rose - bush , lay there still ; and I beg for leave to send a letter to you . so I should , he say , if he might read it first . but this do not answer my design ; and yet I would have send you such a letter as he might see , if I have be sure my danger be over . but that I can not ; for he now seem to take another method , and what I be more afraid of , because , may be , he may watch a opportunity , and join force with it , on occasion , when I be least prepare : for now he seem to abound with kindness , and talk of love without reserve , and make nothing of allow himself in the liberty of kiss I , which he call innocent ; but which I do not like , and especially in the manner he do it : but for a master to do it at all to a servant , have mean too much in it , not to alarm a honest body . morning . I find I be watch and suspect still very close ; and I wish I be with you ; but that must not be , it seem , this fortnight . I do not like this fortnight ; and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to I , I doubt . my master just now send for I down to take a walk with he in the garden : but I like he not at all , nor he way ; for he would have , all the way , he arm about my waist , and say abundance of fond thing to I , enough to make I proud , if he design have not be apparent . after walk about , he lead I into a little alcove , on the farther part of the garden ; and really make I afraid of myself , for he begin to be very teasing , and make I sit on he knee ; and be so often kiss I , that I say , , I do not like to be here at all , I assure you . indeed you make I afraid ! -- and what make I the more so , be what he once say to , and do not think I hear he , and which , though always uppermost with I , I do not mention before , because I do not know how to bring it in , in my writing . she , I suppose , have be encourage he
he in he wickedness ; for it be before the last dreadful trial : and I only hear what he answer . say he , I will try once more ; but I have begin wrong for I see terror do but add to she frost ; but she be a charming girl , and may be thaw by kindness ; and I should have melte she by love , instead of freeze she by fear . be he not a wicked , sad man for this ?-- to be sure , I blush while I write it . but I trust , that that , who have deliver I from the paw of the lion and the bear ; that be , he and 's violence , will soon deliver I from this , that I may not defy the command of the liive ! but , as I be say , this expression come into my thought , I be of opinion , I could not be too much on my guard , at all time : more especially when he take such liberty : for he profess honou all the time with he mouth , while he action do not correspond . I beg and praye he would let I go : and have I not appear quite regardless of all he say , and resolve not to stay , if I could help it , I know not how far he would have proceed ; for I be force to fall down upon my knee . at last he walk out with I , still brag of he honour and he love . yes , yes , sir , say I , you honour be to destroy mine : and you love be to ruin I ; I see it too plainly . but , indeed , I will not talk with you , sir , say I , any more . do you know , say he , whom you talk to , and where you be ? you may believe I have reason to think he not so decent as he should be ; for I say , as to where I be , sir , I know it too well ; and that I have no creature to befriend I : and , as to whom I talk to , sir , let I ask you , what you would have I answer ? why , tell I , say he , what answer you would make ? it will only make you angry , say I ; and so I shall fare worse , if possible . I will not be angry , say he . why , then , sir , say I , you can not be my late good lady 's son ; for she love I , and teach I virtue . you can not then be my master ; for no master demean himself so to he poor servant . he put he arm round I , and he other hand on my neck , which make I more angry and bold : and he say , what then be I ? why , say I , ( struggle from he , and in a great passion , ) to be sure you be himself , in the shape of my master , or you could not use I thus . these be too great libertie , say he , in anger ; and I desire that you will not repeat they , for you own sake : for if you have no decency towards I , I will have none towards you . I be run from he , and he say , come back , when I bid you .-- so , know every place be alike dangerous to I , and I have nobody to run to , I come back , at he call ; and see he look displease , I hold my hand together , and wept , and say , , sir , forgive I . no , say he , rather say , pray , Lucifer , forgive I ! and , now , since you take I for the devil , how can you expect any good from I ?--How , rather , can you expect any thing but the worst treatment from I ?-- you have give I a character , ; and blame I not that I act up to it . , say I , let I beg you to forgive I : I be really sorry for my boldness ; but indeed you do not use I like a gentleman : and how can I express my resentment , if I mince the matter , while you be so indecent ? precise fool ! say he , what indecency have I offer you be bewitch I have not go through my purpose last night ; and then you licentious tongue have not give the worst name to little puny freedom , that show my love and my folly at the same time . but , begone ! say he , take my hand , and toss it from he , and learn another conduct and more wit ; and I will lay aside my foolish regard for you , and assert myself . ! say he , again , with a haughty air . indeed , sir , say I , I can not go , till you pardon I , which I beg on my bended knee . I be truly sorry for my boldness . -- but I see how you go on : you creep by little and little upon I ; and now soothe I , and now threaten I ; and if I should forbear to show my resentment , when you offer incivility to I , would not that be to be lose by degree ? would it not
not show , that I could bear any thing from you , if I do not express all the indignation I could express , at the first approaches you make to what I dread ? and have you not as good as avow my ruin ?-- and have you once make I hope you will quit you purpose against I ? how then , sir , can I act , but by shew my abhorrence of every step that make towards my undoing ? and what be leave I but word ? -- and can these word be other than such strong one , as shall show the detestation which , from the bottom of my heart , I have for every attempt upon my virtue ? judge for I , sir , and pardon I . you ! say he , what ! when you do not repent ?-- when you have the boldness to justify yourself in you fault ? why do not you say , you never will again offend I ? I will endeaavor , sy , say I , always to preserve that decency towards you which become I . but really , sir , I must beg you excuse for say , that when you forget what belong to decency in you action , and when word be all that be leave I , to show my resentment of such action , I will not promise to forbear the strongest expression that my distressed mind shall suggest to I : nor shall you angriest frown deter I , when my honesty be in question . what , then , say he , do you beg pardon for ? where be the promise of amendment , for which I should forgive you ? indeed , sir , say I , I own that must absolutely depend on you usage of I : for I will bear any thing you can inflict upon I with patience , even to the laying down of my life , to show my obedience to you in other case ; but I can not be patient , I can not be passive , when my virtue be at stake ! it would be criminal in I , if I be . he say , he never see such a fool in he life . and he walk by the side of I some yard , without say a word , and seem vex ; and at last walk in , bid I attend he in the garden , after dinner . so have a little time , I go up , and write thus far . night . if , my dear parent , I be not destin more surely than ever for ruin , I have now more comfort before I than ever I yet know : and be either nearer my happiness , or my misery , than ever I be . God protect I from the latter , if it be he bless will ! I have now such a scene to open to you , that , I know , will alarm both you hope and you fear , as it do mine . and this it be : after my master have dine , he take a turn into the stable , to look at he stud of horse ; and , when he come in , he open the parlour - door , where and I sit at dinner ; and , at he entrance , we both rise up ; but he say , sit still , sit still , and let I see how you eat you victual , . o , say , very poorly , indeed , sir ! no , say I , pretty well , sir , consider . none of you considerings , say he , pretty face ; and tap I on the cheek . I blush , but be glad he be so good - humoure ; but I could not tell how to sit before he , nor to behave myself . so he say , I know , , you be a nice carver : my mother use to say so . my lady , sir , say I , be very good to I in every thing , and would always make I do the honour of she table for she , when she be with she few select friend that she love . cut up , say he , that chicken . I do so . now , say he , and take a knife and fork , and put a wing upon my plate , let I see you eat that . of sir , say I , I have eat a whole breast of a chicken already , and can not eat so much . but he say , I must eat it for he sake , and he would teach I to eat heartily : so I do eat it ; but be much confused at he so kind and unusual freedom and condescension . and , good lack ! you can not imagine how look and stare , and how respectful she seem to I , and call I good madam , I will assure you , urge I to take a little bit of tart . my master take two or three turn about the room , musing and thoughtful , as I have never before see he ; and at last he go out , say , I be go into the garden : you know , , what I say to you before dinner . I rise , and courtesy , say , I would attend he honour ; and he say , do , good girl ! well , say , I see how thing will go . o , madam , as she call I again , I be sure you be to
to be we mistress ! and then I know what will become of I . , say I , if I can but keep myself virtuous , ' ti the most of my ambition ; and I hope , no temptation shall make I otherwise . Notwithstanding I have no reason to be pleased with he treatment of I before dinner , yet I make haste to attend he ; and I find he walk by the side of that pond , which , for want of , and through a sinful despondence , have like to have be so fatal to I , and the sight of which , ever since , have be a trouble and reproach to I . and it be by the side of this pond , and not far from the place where I have that dread conflict , that my present hope , if I be not to be deceive again , begin to daw : which I presume to flatter myself with be a happy oman for I , as if would show you poor sinful daughter , how well I do to put my affiance in he goodness , and not to throw away myself , because my ruin seem inevitable , to my short - sighted apprehension . so he be pleased to say , well , , I be glad you be come of you own accord , as I may say : give I you hand . I do so ; and he look at I very steadily , and press my hand all the time , at last say , I will now talk to you in a serious manner . you have a good deal of wit , a great deal of penetration , much beyond you year , and , as I think , you opportunity . you be possess of a open , frank , and generous mind ; and a person so lovely , that you excel all you sex , in my eye . all these accomplishment have engage my affection so deeply , that , as I have often say , I can not live without you ; and I would divide , with all my soul , my estate with you , to make you mine upon my own term . these you have absolutely reject ; and that , though in saucy term enough , yet in such a manner as make I admire you the more . you pretty chit - chat to , the last night , so innocent , and so full of beautiful simplicity , half disarm my resolution before I approach you bed : and I see you so watchful over you virtue , that though I hope to find it otherwise , I can not but confess my passion for you be increase by it . but now , what shall I say farther , ?-- I will make you , though a party , my adviser in this matter , though not , perhaps , my definitive judge . you know I be not a very abandoned profligate ; I have hithertoo been guilty of no very enormous or vile action . this have seize you , and confin you thus , may perhaps be one of the worst , at least to person of real innocence . have I be utterly give up to my passion , I should before now have gratify they , and not have shew that remorse and compassion for you , which have reprieve you , more than once , when absolutely in my power ; and you be as inviolate a virgin as you be when you come into my house . but what can I do ? consider the pride of my condition . I can not endure the thought of marriage , even with a person of equal or superior degree to myself ; and have decline several proposal of that kind : how then , with the distance between we in the world 's judgament , can I think of make you my wife ? -- yet I must have you ; I can not bear the thought of any other man supplant I in you affections : and the very apprehension of that have make I hate the name of , and use he in a manner unworthy of my temper . now , , judge for I ; and , since I have tell you , thus candidly , my mind , and I see yours be big with some important meaning , by you eye , you blush , and that sweet confusion which I behold struggle in you bosom , tell I , with like openness and candour , what you think I ought to do , and what you would have I do . it be impossible for I to express the agitation of my mind , on this unexpected declaration , so contrary to he former behaviour . he manner too have something so noble , and so sincere , as I think , that , alas for I ! I find I have need of all my poor discretion , to ward off the blow which this treatment give to my most guarded thought . I throw myself at he foot ; for I tremble , and could hardly stand : of sir , say I , spare you poor servant 's confusion ! o spare the poor Pamela ! -- speak out , say he , and tell I , when I bid you , what you think I ought to do ? I can not say what you ought to do , answer I : but I only beg you will not ruin I ; and , if you think I virtuous , if you think I sincerely honest , let I go to my poor parent . I will vow to you ,
, that I will never suffer myself to be engage without you approbation . still he insist upon a more explicit answer to he question , of what I think he ought to do . and I do , as to my poor thought of what you ought to do , I must need say , that indeed I think you ought to regard the world 's opinion , and avoid do any thing disgraceful to you birth and fortune ; and , therefore , if you really honour the poor Pamela with you respect , a little time , absence , and the conversation of worthier persons of my sex , will effectually enable you to overcome a regard so unworthy you condition : and this , good sir , be the best advice I can offer . charme creature ! lovely ! say he , ( with a ardour that be never before so agreeable to I , ) this generous manner be of a piece with all the rest of you conduct . but tell I , still more explicitly , what you would advise I to , in the case . o , sir ! say I , take not advantage of my credulity , and these my weak moment : but be I the first lady in the land , instead of the poor abject , I would , I could tell you . but I can say no more -- of my dear father and mother ! now I know you will indeed be concerned for I ; -- for now I be for myself . -- and now I begin to be afraid I know too well the reason why all he hard trial of I , and my black apprehension , would not let I hate he . but be assure still , by 's , that I shall do nothing unworthy of you Pamela ; and if I find that he be still capable of deceive I , and that this conduct be only put on to delude I more , I shall think nothing in this world so vile , and so odious ; and nothing , if he be not the worst of he kind , ( as he say , and , I hope , he be not , ) so desperately guileful , as the heart of man . he generously say , I will spare you confusion , . but I hope I may promise myself , that you can love I preferably to any other man ; and that no one in the world have have any share in you affections ; for I be very jealous of what I love ; and if I think you have a secret whispering in you soul , that have not yet come up to a wish , for any other man breathing , I should not forgive myself to persist in my affection for you ; nor you , if you do not frankly acquaint I with it . as I still continue on my knee , on the grass border by the pond -side , he sit himself down on the grass by I , and take I in he arm : why hesitate my ? say he .-- can you not answer I with truth , as I wish ? if you cannot , speak , and I will forgive you . of good sir , say I , it be not that ; indeed it be not : but a frightful word or two that you say to , when you think I be not in hearing , come cross my mind ; and make I dread that I be in more danger than ever I be in my life . you have never find I a common liar , say he , ( too fearful and foolish ! ) nor will I answer how long I may hold in my present mind ; for my pride struggle hard within I , I will assure you ; and if you doubt I , I have no obligation to you confidence or opinion . but , at present , I be really sincere in what I say : and I expect you will be so too ; and answer directly my question . I find , sy , say I , I know not myself ; and you question be of such a nature , that I only want to tell you what I hear , and to have you kind answer to it ; or else , what I have to say to you question , may pave the way to my ruin , and show a weakness that I do not believe be in I . well , say he , you may say what you have overheard ; for , in not answer I directly , you put my soul upon the rack ; and half the trouble I have have with you would have bring to my arm one of the finest lady in . of sir , say I , my virtue be as dear to I , as if I be of the highest quality ; and my doubt ( for which you know I have have too much reason ) have make I troublesome . but now , sir , I will tell you what I hear , which have give I great uneasiness . you talk to of have begin wrong with I , in try to subdue I with terror , and of frost , and such like -- you remember it well :-- and that you would , for the future , change you conduct , and try to melt I , that be you word , by kindness . I fear not , sir , the grace of support I , that any act of kindness would make I forget what I owe to my
my virtue : but , sir , I may , I find , be make more miserable by such act , than by terror ; because my nature be too frank and open to make I wish to be ungrateful : and if I should be teach a lesson I never yet learnt , with what regret should I descmend to the grave , to think that I could not hate my undoer : and that , at the last great day , I must stand up as a accuser of the poor unhappy soul , that I could wish it in my power to save ! Exalt girl ! say he , what a thought be that !-- why , now , , you excel yourself ! you have give I a hint that will hold I long . but , sweet creature , say he , tell I what be this lesson , which you never yet learn , and which you be so afraid of learn ? if , sir , say I , you will again generously spare my confusion , I need not speak it : but this I will say , in answer to the question you seem most solicitous about , that I know not the man breathing that I would wish to be marry to , or that ever I think of with such a idea . I have bring my mind so to love poverty , that I hope for nothing but to return to the best , though the poorest of parent ; and to employ myself in serve , and comforte they ; and you know not , sir , how you disappoint those hope , and my propose honest pleasur , when you send I hither . well then , say he , I may promise myself , that neither the parson , nor any other man , be any the least secret motive to you steadfast refusal of my offer ? indeed , sir , say I , you may ; and , as you be pleased to ask , I answer , that I have not the least shadow of a wish , or think , for any man liive . but , say he , ( for I be foolishly jealous , and yet it shew my fondness for you , ) have you not encourage to think you will have he ? indeed , sir , say I , I have not ; but the very contrary . and would you not have have he , say he , if you have get away by he means ? I have resolve , sy , say I , in my mind , otherwise ; and he know it ; and the poor man -- I charge you , say he , say not a word in he favour ! you will excite a whirlwind in my soul , if you name he with kindness ; and then you will be borne away with the tempest . , say I , I have do !-- , say he , but do not have do ; let I know the whole . if you have any regard for he , speak out ; for it would end fearfully for you , for I , and for he , if I find that you disguise any secret of you soul from I , in this nice particular . , say I , if I have ever give you cause to think I sincere -- then , say he , interrupt I with great vehemence , and take both my hand between he , , that you now , in the presence of , declare that you have not any the most hidden regard for , or any other man . , say I , I do . as shall bless I , and preserve my innocence , I have not . well , say he , I will believe you , ; and in time , perhaps , I may better bear that man 's name . and , if I be convince that you be not prepossess , my vanity make I assure , that I need not to fear a place in you esteem , equal , if not preferable , to any man in . but yet it sting my pride to the quick , that you be so easily bring , and at such a short acquaintance , to run away with that college novice ! of good sir , say I , may I be hear one thing ? and though I bring upon I you highest indignation , I will tell you , perhaps , the unnecessary and imprudent , but yet the whole truth . my honesty ( I be poor and lowly , and be not entitle to call it honou ) be in danger . I see no means of securing myself from you avowed attempt . you have shew you would not stick at little matter ; and what , sir , could any body have think of my sincerity , in prefer that to all other consideration , if I have not escape from these dangers , if I could have find any way for it ?-- I be not go to say any thing for he ; but , indeed , indeed , sir , I be the cause of put he upon assist I in my escape . I get he to acquaint I what gentry there be in the neighbourhood that I might fly to ; and prevail upon he -- do not fry at I , good sir ; for I must tell you the whole truth -- to apply to one ; to ; and he be so good to apply to , the minister : but they all refuse I ; and then it be he let I know , that there
there be no honourable way but marriage . that I decline ; and he agree to assist I for 's sake . now , say he , you be go -- I boldly put my hand before he mouth , hardly know the liberty I take : pray , sir , say I , do not be angry ; I have just do -- I would only say , that rather than have stay to be ruin , I would have throw myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the world see , if I think he honest .-- and I hope , when you duly weigh all matters , you will forgive I , and not think I so bold , and so forward , as you have be pleased to call I . well , say he , even in this you last speech , which , let I tell you , shew more you honesty of heart than you prudence , you have not over - much please I . but I must love you ; and that vex I not a little . but tell I , , for now the former question recur : since you so much prize you honour , and you virtue ; since all attempt against that be so odious to you ; and since I have avowedly make several of these attempt , do you think it be possible for you to love I preferably to any other of my sex ? ah , sir ! say I , and here my doubt recur , that you may thus graciously use I , to take advantage of my credulity . perverse and doubt ! say he -- can not you take I as I be at present ? and that , I have tell you , be sincere and undesigning , whatever I may be hereafter . ah , sir ! reply I , what can I say ? I have already say too much , if this dreadful hereafter should take place . do not bid I say how well I can -- and then , my face glow as the fire , I , all abash , lean upon he shoulder , to hide my confusion . he clasp I to he with great ardour , and say , hide you dear face in my bosom , my belov Pamela ! you innocent freedom charm I !-- but then say , how well -- what ? if you will be good , say I , to you poor servant , and spare she , I can not say too much ! but if not , I be doubly undone !-- Undone indeed ! say he , I hope my present temper will hold ; for I tell you frankly , that I have know , in this agreeable hour , more sincere pleasure than I have experience in all the guilty tumult that my desire soul compelle I into , in the hope of possesse you on my own term . and , , you must pray for the continuance of this temper ; and I hope you prayer will get the better of my temptation . this sweet goodness overpower all my reserve . I throw myself at he foot , and embrace he knee : what pleasure , sir , you give I at these gracious word , be not lent you poor servant to express !-- I shall be too much reward for all my suffering , if this goodness hold ! grant it may , for you own soul 's sake as well as mine . and oh ! how happy should I be , if ---- he stopt I , and say , but , my dear girl , what must we do about the world , and the world 's censure ? indeed , I can not marry ! now be I again struck all of a heap . however , soon recollect myself , , say I , I have not the presumption to hope such a honour . if I may be permit to return in peace and safety to my poor parent , to pray for you there , it be all I at present request ! this , sir , after all my apprehension and danger , will be a great pleasure to I . and , if I know my own poor heart , I shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable degree ; and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make for the happiness of my late good lady 's most beloved son . well , say he , this conversation , , be go farther than I intend it . you need not be afraid , at this rate , of trust yourself with I : but it be I that ought to be doubtful of myself , when I be with you . --but before I say any thing farther on this subject , I will take my proud heart to task ; and , till then , let every thing be as if this conversation have never pass . only , let I tell you , that the more confidence you place in I , the more you will oblige I : but you doubt will only beget cause of doubt . and with this ambiguous say , he salute I with a more formal manner , if I may so say , than before , and lent I he hand ; and so we walk toward the house , side by side , he seem very thoughtful and pensive , as if he have already repent he of he goodness . what shall I do , what step take , if all this be design -- of the perplexity of these cruel doubting !-- to be sure , if he be false , as I may call it ,
, I have go too far , much too far !-- I be ready , on the apprehension of this , to bite my forward tongue ( or rather to beat my more forward heart , that dictate to that poor machine ) for what I have say . but sure , at least , he must be sincere for the time !-- he could not be such a practise dissembler !-- if he could , of how desperately wick be the heart of man !-- and where could he learn all these barbarous art ?-- if so , it must be native surely to the sex!-- but , silent be my rash censuring ; be hush , ye stormy tumult of my disturbed mind ! for have I not a father who be a man ?-- a man who know no guile ! who would do no wrong !-- who would not deceive or oppress , to gain a kingdom !--How then can I think it be native to the sex ? and I must also hope my good lady 's son can not be the worst of man !-- if he be , hard the lot of the excellent woman that bear he ! -- but much harder the hap of you poor , who have fall into such hand ! -- but yet I will trust in , and hope the best : and so lay down my tired pen for this time . morning . somebody rap at we chamber - door this morning , soon after it be light : ask , who it be ? my master say , open the door , ! o , say I , for 's sake , , do not ! indeed , say she , but I must . then , say I , and cling about she , let I slip on my clothes first . but he rap again , and she break from I ; and I be frightene out of my wit , and fold myself in the bed - clothes . he enter , and say , what , , so fearful , after what pass yesterday between we ! o , sir , sir , say I , I fear my prayer have want they wished effect ! pray , good sir , consider -- he sit down on the bed - side , and interrupt I ; no need of you foolish fear ; I shall say but a word or two , and go away . after you go up stair , say he , I have a invitation to a ball , which be to be this night at , on occasion of a wedding ; and I be go to call on , and he lady and daughter ; for the bride be a relation of theirs : so I shall not be at home till . I come , therefore , to caution you , , before , ( that she may not wonder at be closer confin , than for these three or four day past , ) that nobody see she , nor deliver any letter to she , in that space ; for a person have be see lurking about , and inquire after she , and I have be well inform , that either , or , have write a letter , with a design of have it convey to she : and , say he , you must know , , that I have order to give up he account , and have dismiss and , since I have be here ; for they behaviour have be intolerable ; and they have make such a breach between my sister Davers and I , as we shall never , perhaps , make up . now , , I shall take it kindly in you , if you will confine yourself to you chamber pretty much , for the time I be absent , and not give cause of trouble or uneasiness ; and the rather , as you know she act by my order . ! sir , say I , I fear all these good people have suffer for my sake !-- why , say he , I believe so too ; and there be never a girl of you innocence , that set a large family in such a uproar , surely . -- but let that pass . you know both of you my mind , and , in part , the reason of it . I shall only say , that I have have such a letter from my sister , as I could not have expect ; and , , say he , neither you nor I have reason to thank she , as you shall know , perhaps at my return .-- I go in my coach , Jewkes , because I take , and 's niece , and one of 's daughter , along with I ; and and he other daughter go in he chariot : so let all the gate be fasten ; and do not take any airing in either of the chariot , nor let any body go to the gate , without you , . I will be sure , say she , to obey you honour . I will give no trouble , sir , say I ; and will keep pretty much in my chamber , and not stir so much as into the garden without she ; to show you I will obey in every thing I can . but I begin to fear -- ay , say he , more plot and contrivance , do not you ?--but I will assure you , you never have less reason ; and I tell you the truth ; for I be really go to Stamford this time ; and upon the occasion I tell you . and so ,
, , give I you hand , and one kiss ; and then I be go . I durst not refuse , and say , bless you , sir , wherever you go ! --but I be sorry for what you tell I about you servants ! he and have a little talk without the door ; and I hear she say , you may depend , sir , upon my care and vigilance . he go in he coach , as he say he should , and very richly dress , which look as if what he say be likely : but really I have be use to so many trick , and plot , and surprise , that I know not what to think . but I mourn for poor .-- so here be ; here 's poor naughty ; here be good , and , and , turn away for I !-- be rich , indeed , and so need the less matter it ; but I know it will grieve he : and for poor , I be sure it will cut that good old servant to the heart . Alas for I ! what mischief be I the occasion of !-- or , rather , my master , whose action towards I have make so many of my kind friend forfeit he favour , for my sake ! I be very sad about these thing : if he really love I , methink he should not be so angry , that he servants love I too .-- I know not what to think ! night . I have remove my papers from under the rose - bush ; for I see the gardener begin to dig near that spot ; and I be afraid he would find they . and I be look yesterday through the iron gate that front the elm ; and a gipsy - like body make up to we , and say ; if , madam , you will give I some break victual , I will tell you both you fortune . I say , let we hear we fortune , . she say , I do not like these sort of people ; but we will hear what she will say to we , however . I sha not fetch you any victual , woman ; but I will give you some pence , say she . but come out , she say , fetch some bread , and some of the cold meat , and you shall have you fortune tell , . this , you will think , like some of my other matters , a very trifling thing to write about . but mark the discovery of a dreadful plot , which I have make by it . o , bless I ! what can I think of this naughty , this very naughty gentleman !-- now will I hate he most heartily . thus it be :-- have no suspicion of the woman , the iron gate be lock , and she on the outside , and we on the inside ; and so put she hand through . she say , mutter over a parcel of cramp word ; why , madam , you will marry soon , I can tell you . at that she seem pleased , and say , I be glad to hear that ; and shake she fat side with laughing . the woman look most earnestly at I , all the time , and as if she have meane . then it come into my head , from my master 's caution , that possibly this woman might be employ to try to get a letter into my hand ; and I be resolve to watch all she motion . so say , what sort of a man shall I have , pray ?-- why , say she , a man younger than yourself ; and a very good husband he will prove .-- I be glad of that , say she ; and laugh again . come , madam , let we hear you fortune . the woman come to I , and take my hand . o ! say she , I can not tell you fortune : you hand be so white and fine , I can not see the line : but , say she , and , stoop , pull up a little tuft of grass , I have a way for that ; and so rub my hand with the mould part of the tuft : now , say she , I can see the line . be very watchful of all her way , and take the tuft , and look upon it , lest any thing should be in that . and then the woman say , here be the line of cross the line of life ; and -- ! my pretty mistress , say she , you have best take care of yourself ; for you be hard beset , I will assure you . you will never be marry , I can see ; and will die of you first child . out upon thee , woman ! say I , better thou hadst never come here . , whisper , I do not like this : it look like a cheat : pray , , go in , this moment . so I will , say I ; for I have enough of fortune - tell . and in I go . the woman want sadly to tell I more , which make threaten she , suspect still the more ; and away the woman go , have tell she fortune , and she would be drown . this thing run strongly in all we head ; and we go , a hour after , to see if the woman be lurk about , and take for
for we guard . look through the iron gate , he spy a man saunter about the middle of the walk ; which fill with still more suspicion ; and she say , , you and I will walk towards this fellow , and see what he saunter there for : and , , do you and madam stay at the gate . so they open the iron gate and walk down towards the man ; and guess the woman , if employ , must mean something by the tuft of grass , I cast my eye that way , whence she pull it , and see more grass seemingly pull up : then I doubt not something be there for I ; and I walk to it , and stand over it , say to , that be a pretty sort of wild flower , that grow yonder , near the elm , the fifth from we on the left ; pray pull it for I . say she , it be a common weed . well , say I , but pull it for I ; there be sometimes beautiful colour in a weed . while she go on , I stoop , and pull up a good handful of the grass , and in it a bit of paper , which I put instantly in my bosom , and dropt the grass : and my heart go pit - a - pat at the odd adventure . say I , Let 's go in , . no , say she , we must stay till come . I be all impatience to read this paper : and when and she return , I go in . say she , certainly there be some reason for my master 's caution : I can make nothing of this saunter fellow ; but , to be sure , there be some roguery in the gipsy . well , say I , if there be , she lose she aim , you see ! ay , very true , say she ; but that be owe to my watchfulness ; and you be very good to go away , when I speak to you . I hasten up stair to my closet , and find the billet to contain , in a hand that seem disguise , and bad spelling , the follow word : ' twenty contrivance have be think of to let you know you danger : but all have prove in vain . you friend hope it be not yet too late to give you this caution , if it reach you hand . the ' squire be absolutely determined to ruin you ; and , because he despair of any other way , he will pretend great love and kindness to you , and that he will marry you . you may expect a parson , for this purpose , in a few day ; but it be a sly artful fellow , of a broken attorney , that he have hire to personate a minister . the man have a broad face , pit much with the small - pox , and be a very great companion . so take care of yourself . doubt not this advice . perhaps you will have have but too much reason already to confirm you in the truth of it . from you zealous well - wisher , ' . ' now , my dear father and mother , what shall we say of this truly diabolical master ! o , how shall I find word to paint my grief , and he deceit ! I have as good as confess I love he ; but , indeed , it be on suppose he good .-- this , however , have give he too much advantage . but now I will break this wick forward heart of mine , if it will not be teach to hate he ! o , what a black dismal heart must he have ! so here be a plot to ruin I , and by my own consent to !-- no wonder he do not improve he wick opportunity , ( which I think owe to remorse for he sin , and compassion for I , ) when he have such a project as this in reserve ! -- here should I have be delude with the hope of a happiness that my highest ambition could have have aspire to ! -- but how dreadful must have be my lot , when I have find myself a undone creature , and a guilty harlot , instead of a lawful wife ! oh ! this be indeed too much , too much , for you poor Pamela to support ! this be the worse , as I hope all the worst be over ; and that I have the pleasure of beholding a reclaim man , and not a abandoned libertine . what now must you poor daughter do ? now all she hope be dash ! and if this fail he , then come , to be sure , my force disgrace ! for this shew he will never leave till he have ruin I -- o , the wretch , wretch ! noon , one o'clock . my master be come home ; and , to be sure , have be where he say . so once he have tell truth ; and this matter seem to be go off without a plot : no doubt he depend upon he sham wick marriage ! he have bring a gentleman with he to dinner ; and so I have not see he yet . two o'clock . I be very sorrowful , and still have greater reason ; for , just now , as I be in my closet , open the parcel I have hide under the rose - bush , to see
see if it be damage by lie so long , come upon I by surprise , and lay she hand upon it ; for she have be look through the key - hole , it seem . I know not what I shall do ! for now he will see all my private thought of he , and all my secret , as I may say . what a careless creature I be !-- to be sure I deserve to be punish . you know i have the good luck , by 's means , to send you all my papers down to night , the day of my imprisonment . but now these papers contain all my matter from that time , to Wednesday the 27th day of my distress : and which , as you may now , perhaps , never see , I will briefly mention the contents to you . in these papers , then , be include , ' a account of 's art to draw I in to approve off 's proposal for marriage ; and my refuse to do so ; and desire you not to encourage he suit to I . 's be wickedly rob , and a visit of hers to he ; whereby she discover all he secret . how I be inclin to get off , while she be gone ; but be ridiculously prevent by my foolish fear , etc . my have the key of the back - door . 's write to my master all the secret she have discover of , and she behaviour to I and he upon it . Continuance of my correspondence with by the tiles ; begin in the parcel you have . my reproach to he for he reveal himself to ; and he letter to I in answer , threaten to expose my master , if he deceive he ; mention in it 's correspondence with he ; and a letter which send , and be intercept , as it seem . of the correspondence be carry on by a friend of he at . of the horse he be to provide for I , and one for himself . of what have own to ; and of my discourage he proposal . then it contain a pressing letter of mine to he , urge my escape before my master come ; with he half - angry answer to I . you good letter to I , my dear father , send to I by 's conveyance ; in which you would have I encourage , but leave it to I ; and in which , fortunately enough , you take notice of my be uninclined to marry .-- my earnest desire to be with you . the substance of my answer to , express more patience , etc . a dreadful letter of my master to ; which , by mistake , be direct to I ; and one to I , direct by like mistake to she ; and very free reflection of mine upon both . the concern I express for 's be take in , deceive , and ruin . a account of 's glory in she wicked fidelity . a sad description I give of , a person he send down to assist in watch I . how be arrest , and throw into gaol ; and the concern I express upon it ; and my free reflection on my master for it . a project contrivance of mine , to get away out of the window , and by the back - door ; and throw by petticoat and handkerchief into the pond to amuse they , while I get off : a attempt that have like to have end very dreadfully for I ! my further concern for 's ruin , on my account : and , lastly , my over -hearing brag of she contrivance to rob , in order to get at my papers ; which , however , he preserve , and send safe to you . ' these , down to the execution of my unfortunate plot to escape , be , to the best of my remembrance , the contents of the papers , which this merciless woman seize : for , how badly I come off , and what follow , I still have safe , as I hope , sew in my under - coat , about my hip . in vain be all my prayer and tear to she , to get she not to show they to my master . for she say , it have now come out , why I affect to be so much alone ; and why I be always write . and she think herself happy , she say , she have find these ; for often and often have she search every place she could think of , for writing , to no purpose before . and she hope , she say , there be nothing in they by what any body might see ; for , say she , you know you be all innocence !-- Insolent creature ! say I , I be sure you be all guil !-- and so you must do you worst ; for now I can not help myself , and I see there be no mercy to be expect from you . just now , my master be come up , she go to he upon the stair , and give he my papers . there , sir , say she ; you always say be a great writer ; but I never could get at any thing of hers before . he take they ; and , without come to I , go down to the parlour again . and what with the gipsy affair , and what with this , I could not think of go down to
to dinner ; and she tell he that too ; and so I suppose I shall have he up stair , as soon as he company be gone . , six o'clock . my master come up , and , in a pleasanter manner than I expect , say , so , , we have seize , it seem , you treasonable papers ? Treasonable ! say I , very sullenly . ay , say he , I suppose so ; for you be a great plotter : but I have not read they yet . then , sir , say I , very gravely , it will be truly honourable in you not to read they ; but to give they to I again . to whom , say he , be they write ?-- to my father , sir ; but I suppose you see to whom .-- indeed , return he , I have not read three line yet . then , pray , sir , do not read they ; but give they to I again . that I will not , say he , till I have read they . , say I , you serve I not well in the letter I use to write formerly : I think it be not worthy you character to contrive to get they in you hand , by that false ! for should such a gentleman as you mind what you poor servant write ? --yes , say he , by all mean , mind what such a servant as my write . you Pamela ! thing I . then the sham marriage come into my head ; and indeed it have not be out of it , since the gipsy affair .-- but , say he , have you any thing in these papers you would not have I see ? to be sure , sir , say I , there be ; for what one write to one 's father and mother , be not for every body to see . , say he , be I every body . those letter , add he , that I do see by 's means , be not to you disadvantage , I will assure you ; for they give I a very high opinion of you wit and innocence : and if I have not love you , do you think I would have trouble myself about you letter ? ! sir , say I , great pride to I that ! for they give you such a opinion of my innocence , that you be resolve to ruin I . and what advantage have they bring I !-- who have be make a prisoner , and use as I have be between you and you housekeeper . why , , say he , a little seriously , why this behaviour , for my goodness to you in the be not of a piece with you conduct and softness there , that quite charme I in you favour : and you must not give I cause to think that you will be the more insolent , as you find I kinder . ah ! sir , say I , you know best you own heart and design ! but I fear I be too open - hear then ; and that you still keep you resolution to undo I , and have only change the form of you proceedings . when I tell you once again , say he , a little sternly , that you can not oblige I more , than by place some confidence in I , I will let you know , that these foolish and perverse doubt be the worst thing you can be guilty of . but , say he , I shall possibly account for the cause of they , in these papers of yours ; for I doubt not you have be sincere to you father and mother , though you begin to make I suspect you : for I tell you , perverse girl , that it be impossible you should be thus cold and insensible , after what have pass in the garden , if you be not prepossess in some other person 's favour : and let I add , that if I find it so , it shall be attend with such effect , as will make every vein in you heart bleed . he be go away in wrath ; and I say , one word , good sir , one word before you read they , since you will read they : pray make allowances -- for all the harsh reflection that you will find in they , on you own conduct to I : and remember only , that they be not write for you sight ; and be penn by a poor creature hardly use , and who be in constant apprehension of receive from you the worst treatment that you could inflict upon she . if that be all , say he , and there be nothing of another nature , that I can not forgive , you have no cause for uneasiness ; for I have as many instance of you saucy reflection upon I in you former letter , as there be line ; and yet , you see , I have never upbraide you on that score ; though , perhaps , I wish you have be more sparing of you epithet , and you freedom of that sort . well , sir , say I , since you will , you must read they ; and I think I have no reason to be afraid of be find insincere , or have , in any respect , tell you a falsehood ; because , though I do not remember all I write , yet I know I write my heart ; and that be not deceitful
deceitful . and remember , sir , another thing , that I always declare I think myself right to endeaavor to make my escape from this force and illegal restraint ; and so you must not be angry that I would have do so , if I could . I will judge you , never fear , say he , as favourably as you deserve ; for you have too powerful a pleader within I . and so go down stair . about nine o'clock he send for I down into the parlour . I go a little fearfully ; and he hold the paper in he hand , and say , now , , you come upon you trial . say I , I hope I have a just judge to hear my cause . ay , say he , and you may hope for a merciful one too , or else I know not what will become of you . I expect , continue he , that you will answer I directly , and plainly , to every question I shall ask you .-- in the first place , here be several love - letter between you and . love -letter ! sir , say I .-- well , call they what you will , say he , I do not entirely like they , I will assure you , with all the allowances you desire I to make for you . do you find , sy , say I , that I encourage he proposal , or do you not ? why , say he , you discourage he address in appearance ; but no otherwise than all you cunning sex do to ours , to make we more eager in pursue you . well , sir , say I , that be you comment ; but it do not appear so in the text . Smartly say ! say he : where a d --- l gottest thou , at these year , all this knowledge ? and then thou hast a memory , as I see by you papers , that nothing escape . ! sir , say I , what poor ability I have , serve only to make I more miserable !-- I have no pleasure in my memory , which impress thing upon I , that I could be glad never were , or everlastingly to forget . well , say he , so much for that -- but where be the account ( since you have keep so exact a journal of all that have befall you ) previous to these here in my hand ? my father have they , sir , say I .-- by whose mean ? say he -- by 's , say I . well answer , say he . but can not you contrive to get I a sight of they ? that would be pretty ! say I . I wish I could have contrive to have keep those you have from you sight . say he , I must see they , , or I shall never be easy ; for I must know how this correspondence between you and begin : and if I can see they , it shall be better for you , if they answer what these give I hope they will . I can tell you , sir , very faithfully , say I , what the beginning be ; for I be bold enough to be the beginner . that will not do , say he ; for though this may appear a punctilio to you , to I it be of high importance . , say I , if you please to let I go to my father , I will send they to you by any messenger you shall send for they . will you so ? but I dare say , if you will write for they , they will send they to you , without the trouble of such a journey to yourself : and I beg you will . I think , sy , say I , as you have see all my former letter through 's baseness , and now these , through you faithful housekeeper 's officious watchfulness , you might see all the rest : but I hope you will not desire it , till I can see how much my please you in this particular will be of use to myself . you must trust to my honour for that . but tell I , , say the sly gentleman , since I have see these , would you have voluntarily shew I those , have they be in you possession ? I be not aware of this inference , and say , yes , truly , sir , I think I should , if you command it . well then , , say he , as I be sure you have find mean to continue you journal , I desire , till the former part can come , that you will show I the succeeding .-- of sir , sir , say I , have you catch I so ? --but indeed you must excuse I there . why , say he , tell I truly , have you not continue you account till now ? do not ask I , sir , say I . but I insist upon you answer , reply he . why then , sir , I will not tell a untruth ; I have .-- that be my good girl ! say he , I love sincerity at my heart .-- in another , sir , say I , I presume you mean !-- well , say he , I will allow you to be a little witty upon I ; because it be in you , and you can not help it : but you will greatly oblige I , to
to show I voluntarily what you have write . I long to see the particular of you plot , and you disappointment , where you papers leave off : for you have so beautiful a manner , that it be partly that , and partly my love for you , that have make I desirous of read all you write ; though a great deal of it be against myself ; for which you must expect to suffer a little : and as I have furnish you with the subject , I have a title to see the fruit of you pen .-- , say he , there be such a pretty air of romance , as you relate they , in you plot , and my plot , that I shall be better direct in what manner to wind up the catastrophe of the pretty novel . if I be you equal , sir , say I , I should say this be a very provoking way of jeer at the misfortune you have bring upon I . o , say he , the libertie you have take with my character in you letter , set we upon a par , at least in that respect . , I could not have take those libertie , if you have not give I the cause : and the cause , sir , you know , be before the effect . true , , say he ; you chop logic very prettily . what the deuse do we man go to school for ? if we wit be equal to woman 's , we might spare much time and pain in we education : for nature teach you sex , what , in a long course of labour and study , ours can hardly attain to .-- but , indeed , every lady be not a Pamela . you delight to banter you poor servant , say I . , continue he , I believe I must assume to myself half the merit of you wit , too ; for the innocent exercise you have have for it , from I , have certainly sharpen you invention . , say I , could I have be without those innocent exercise , as you be pleased to call they , I should have be glad to have be as dull as a beetle . but then , , say he , I should not have love you so well . but then , sir , I should have be safe , easy , and happy .-- ay , may be so , and may be not ; and the wife , too , of some clouterly plough - boy . but then , sir , I should have be content and innocent ; and that be better than be a princess , and not so . and may be not , say he ; for if you have have that pretty face , some of we keen fox - hunter should have find you out ; and , in spite of you romantic notion , ( which then , too , perhaps , would not have have so strong a place in you mind , ) might have be more happy with the ploughman 's wife , than I have be with my mother 's . I hope , sy , say I , would have give I more grace . well , but , resume he , as to these writing of yours , that follow you fine plot , I must see they . indeed , sir , you must not , if I can help it . nothing , say he , please I better , than that , in all you arts , shift , and stratagem , you have have a great regard to truth ; and have , in all you little piece of deceit , tell very few wilful fib . now I expect you will continue this laudable rule in you conversation with I .-- let I know then , where you have find supplies of pen , ink , and paper , when be so vigilant , and give you but two sheet at a time ?-- tell I truth . why , sir , little do I think I should have such occasion for they ; but , when I go away from you house , I beg some of each of good , who give I plenty . yes , yes , say he , it must be good ! all you confederate be good , every one of they : but such of my servant as have do they duty , and obey my order , be pain out by you as black as devils ! nay , so be I too , for that matter . , say I , I hope you will not be angry , but , save yourself , do you think they be paint worse than they deserve ? or worse than the part they act require ? you say , save myself , ; but be not that say a mere compliment to I , because I be present , and you be in my hand ? tell I truly .-- good sir , excuse I ; but I fancy I might ask you , why you should think so , if there be not a little bit of conscience that tell you , there be but too much reason for it ? he kiss I , and say , I must either do thus , or be angry with you ; for you be very saucy , .-- but , with you bewitching chit-chat , and pretty impertinence , I will not lose my question . where do you hide you paper , pens , and ink ? some , sir , in one place , some in another ; that I might
might have some left , if other should be find .-- that be a good girl ! say he ; I love you for you sweet veracity . now tell I where it be you hide you write papers , you saucy journal ?-- I must beg you excuse for that , sir , say I . but indeed , answer he , you will not have it : for I will know , and I will see they .-- this be very hard , sir , say I ; but I must say , you shall not , if I can help it . we be stand most of this time ; but he then sit down , and take I by both my hand , and say , well say , my , if you can help it ! but I will not let you help it . tell I , be they in you pocket ? no , sir , say I ; my heart up at my mouth . say he , I know you will not tell a downright fib for the world : but for equivocation ! no jesuit ever go beyond you . answer I then , be they in neither of you pockets ? no , sir , say I . be they not , say he , about you stay ? no , sir , reply I : but pray no more question : for ask I ever so much , I will not tell you . o , say he , I have a way for that . I can do as they do abroad , when the criminal will not confess ; torture they till they do . -- but pray , sir , say I , be this fair , just , or honest ? I be no criminal ; and I will not confess . o , my girl ! say he , many a innocent person have be put to the torture . but let I know where they be , and you shall escape the question , as they call it abroad . , say I , the torture be not use in , and I hope you will not bring it up . Admirably say ! say the naughty gentleman .-- but I can tell you of as good a punishment . if a criminal will not plead with we , here in , we press he to death , or till he do plead . and so now , , that be a punishment shall certainly be yours , if you will not tell without . Tears stand in my eye , and I say , this , sir , be very cruel and barbarous .-- no matter , say he ; it be but like you , you know , in my shape ! and , after I have do so many heinous thing by you as you think , you have no great reason to judge so hardly of this ; or , at least , it be but of a piece with the rest . but , sir , say I , ( dreadfully afraid he have some notion they be about I , ) if you will be obeyed in this unreasonable manner , though it be sad tyranny , to be sure !-- let I go up to they , and read they over again , and you shall see so far as to the end of the sad story that follow those you have . I will see they all , say he , down to this time , if you have write so far :-- or , at least , till within this week .-- then let I go up to they , say I , and see what I have write , and to what day , to show they to you ; for you will not desire to see every thing . but I will , reply he .-- but say , , tell I truth : be they above ? I be much affrighted . he see my confusion . tell I truth , say he . why , sir , answer I , I have sometimes hide they under the dry mould in the garden ; sometimes in one place , sometimes in another ; and those you have in you hand , be several day under a rose - bush , in the garden . Artful slut ! say he , what be this to my question ?-- be they not about you ?-- if , say I , I must pluck they out of my hiding - place behind the wainscot , will not you see I ? -- still more and more artful ! say he -- be this a answer to my question ? -- I have search every place above , and in you closet , for they , and can not find they ; so I will know where they be . now , say he , it be my opinion they be about you ; and I never undress a girl in my life ; but I will now begin to strip my pretty Pamela ; and I hope I shall not go far before I find they . I fall a crying , and say , I will not be use in this manner . pray , sir , say I , ( for he begin to unpin my handkerchief , ) consider ! pray sir , do ! -- and pray , say he , do you consider . for I will see these papers . but may be , say he , they be tie about you knee , with you garter , and stoop . be ever any thing so vile and so wick ?-- I fall on my knee , and say , what can I do ? what can I
I do ? if you will let I go up I will fetch they to you . will you , say he , on you honour , let I see they uncurtailed , and not offer to make they away ; no not a single paper ?--I will , sir .-- on you honour ? yes , sir . and so he let I go up stair , cry sadly for vexation to be so use . sure nobody be ever so serve as I be ! I go to my closet , and there I sit I down , and could not bear the thought of give up my papers . besides , I must all undress I , in a manner , to untack they . so I writ thus : ' , 'To expostulate with such a arbitrary gentleman , I know will signify nothing ; and most hardly do you use the power you so wickedly have get over I . I have heart enough , sir , to do a deed that would make you regret use I thus ; and I can hardly bear it , and what I be further to undergo . but a superior consideration withhold I ; thank , it do ! -- I will , however , keep my word , if you insist upon it when you have read this ; but , sir , let I beg of you to give I time till to - morrow morning , that I may just run they over , and see what I put into you hand against I : and I will then give my papers to you , without the least alteration , or add or diminish : but I should beg still to be excuse , if you please : but if not , spare they to I but till to - morrow morning : and this , so hardly be I use , shall be think a favour , which I shall be very thankful for . ' I guess it would not be long before I hear from he and he accordingly send up Jewkes for what I have promise . so I give she this note to carry to he . and he send word , that I must keep my promise , and he would give I till morning ; but that I must bring they to he , without he ask again . so I take off my under - coat , and with great trouble of mind , unsew they from it . and there be a vast quantity of it . I will just slightly touch upon the subject ; because I may not , perhaps , get they again for you to see . they begin with a account of 'my attempt to get away out of the window first , and then throw my petticoat and handkerchief into the pond . how sadly I be disappointed , the lock of the back - door be change . how , in try to climb over the door , I tumble down , and be piteously bruise ; the brick give way , and tumbl upon I . how , find I could not get off , and dread the hard usage I should receive , I be so wicked as to think of throw myself into the water . my sad reflection upon this matter . how use I upon this occasion , when she find I . how my master have like to have be drown in hunting ; and my concern for he danger , notwithstand he usage of I . 's wicked report , to frighten I , that I be to be marry to the ugly Swiss ; who be to sell I on the wedding - day to my master . she vile way of talk to I , like a prostitute . my apprehension of see preparations make for my master 's come . she causeless fear that I be try to get away again , when I have no thought of it ; and my bad usage upon it . my master 's dreadful arrival ; and he hard , very hard treatment of I ; and 's insulting of I . he jealousy of and I . how vilely instigate he to wickedness . ' and down to here , I put into one parcel , hope that would content he . but for fear it should not , I put into another parcel the follow ; viz . 'A copy of he proposal to I , of a great parcel of gold , and fine clothes and ring , and a estate of I can not tell what a year ; and 50 l . a year for the life of both you , my dear parent , to be he mistress ; with a insinuation , that , may be , he would marry I at the year 's end : all sadly vile : with threatening , if I do not comply , that he would ruin I , without allow I any thing . a copy of my answer , refuse all , with just abhorrence : but begge at last he goodness towards I , and mercy on I , in the most move manner I could think of . a account of he angry behaviour , and 's wick advice hereupon . he try to get I to he chamber ; and my refusal to go . a deal of stuff and chit - chat between I and the odious ; in which she be very wicked and very insulting . two note I write , as if to be carry to church , to pray for he reclaiming , and my safety ; which Jewkes seize , and officiously shew he . a confession of mine , that , notwithstand he bad usage ,
, I could not hate he . my concern for . a horrid contrivance of my master 's to ruin I ; be in my room , disguise in clothes of the maid 's , who lay with I and . how narrowly I escape , ( it make my heart ache to think of it still ! ) by fall into fit . 's detestable part in this sad affair . how he seem move at my danger , and forbore he abominable design ; and assure I he have offer no indecency . how ill I be for a day or two after ; and how kind he seem . how he make I forgive . how , after this , and great kindness pretend , he make rude offer to I in the garden , which I escape . how I resent they . ' then I have write , ' how kindly he behave himself to I ; and how he praise I , and give I great hope of he be good at last . of the too tender impression this make upon I ; and how I begin to be afraid of my own weakness and consideration for he , though he have use I so ill . how sadly jealous he be of ; and how I , as justly could , clear myself as to he doubt on that score . how , just when he have raise I up to the highest hope of he goodness , he dash I sadly again , and go off more coldly . my free reflection upon this trye occasion . ' this bring down matter from , the 20th day of my imprisonment , to Wednesday the 41st , and here I be resolve to end , let what would come ; for only , , and , remain to give a account of ; and he set out to a ball at ; and be the gipsy story ; and this be , he return from . and truly , I shall have but little heart to write , if he be to see all . so these two parcel of papers I have get ready for he against to - morrow morning . to be sure I have always use he very freely in my writings , and shew he no mercy ; but yet he must thank himself for it ; for I have only writ truth ; and I wish he have deserve a better character at my hand , as well for he own sake as mine .-- so , though I do not know whether ever you will see what I write , I must say , that I will go to bed , with remember you in my prayer , as I always do , and as I know you do I : and so , my dear parent , good night . morning . I remembe what he say , of not be oblige to ask again for my papers ; and what I should be force to do , and could not help , I think I might as well do in such a manner as might show I would not disoblige on purpose : though I stomach this matter very heavily too . I have therefore get in readiness my two parcel ; and he , not go to church in the morning , bid tell I he be go into the garden . I know that be for I to go to he ; and so I go : for how can I help be at he beck ? which grieve I not a little , though he be my master , as I may say ; for I be so wholly in he power , that it would do I no good to incense he ; and if I refuse to obey he in little matter , my refusal in greater would have the less weight . so I go down to the garden ; but as he walk in one walk , I take another , that I might not seem too forward neither . he soon ' spy I , and say , do you expect to be courte to come to I ? , say I , and cross the walk to attend he , I do not know but I should interrupt you in you meditations this good day . be that the case , say he , truly , and from you heart ? why , sir , say I , I do not doubt but you have very good thought sometimes , though not towards I . I wish , say he , I could avoid think so well of you as I do . but where be the papers ?-- I dare say you have they about you yesterday ; for you say in those I have , that you will bury you writing in the garden , for fear you should be search , if you do not escape . this , add he , give I a glorious pretence to search you ; and I have be vex myself all night , that I do not strip you garment by garment , till I have find they . of fie , sir , say I ; let I not be scare , with hearing that you have such a thought in earnest . well , say he , I hope you have not now the papers to give I ; for I have rather find they myself , I will assure you . I do not like this way of talk at all ; and think it best not to dwell upon it , say , well , but , sir , you will excuse I , I hope , give up my papers . do not trifle with I , say he ;
; where be they ?-- I think I be very good to you last night , to humour you as I do . if you have either add or diminish , and have not strictly keep you promise , woe be to you ! indeed , sir , say I , I have neither add nor diminish . but there be the parcel that go on with my sad attempt to escape , and the terrible consequence it have like to have be follow with . and it go down to the naughty article you send I . and as you know all that have happen since , I hope these will satisfy you . he be go to speak ; but I say , to drive he from thinking of any more , and I must beg you , sir , to read the matter favourably , if I have exceed in any libertie of my pen . I think , say he , half - smile , you may wonder at my patience , that I can be so easy to read myself abuse as I be by such a saucy slut .-- , say I , I have wonder you should be so desirous to see my bold stuff ; and , for that very reason , I have think it a very good , or a very bad sign . what , say he , be you good sign ?-- that it may have a effect upon you temper , at last , in my favour , when you see I so sincere . you bad sign ? why , that if you can read my reflection and observation upon you treatment of I , with tranquillity , and not be move , it be a sign of a very cruel and determined heart . now , pray , sir , do not be angry at my boldness in tell you so freely my thought . you may , perhaps , say he , be least mistaken , when you think of you bad sign . forbid ! say I . so I take out my papers ; and say , here , sir , they be . but if you please to return they , without break the seal , it will be very generous : and I will take it for a great favour , and a good oman . he break the seal instantly , and open they : so much for you oman ! reply he . I be sorry for it , say I , very seriously ; and be walk away . Whither now ? say he . I be go in , sir , that you might have time to read they , if you think fit . he put they into he pocket , and say , you have more than these . yes , sir : but all they contain , you know as well as I .--but I do not know , say he , the light you put thing in ; and so give they I , if you have not a mind to be search . , say I , I can not stay , if you will not forbear that ugly world .-- give I then no reason for it . where be the other papers ? why , then , unkind sir , if it must be so , here they be . and so I give he , out of my pocket , the second parcel , seal up , as the former , with this superscription ; from the naughty article , down , through sad attempt , to the 42d day of my imprisonment . this be last , be it ? yes , sir ; but now you will see what I write , I will find some other way to employ my time : for how can I write with any face , what must be for you perusal , and not for those I intend to read my melancholy story ? yes , say he , I would have you continue you penmanship by all mean ; and , I assure you , in the mind I be in , I will not ask you for any after these ; except any thing very extraordinary occur . and I have another thing to tell you , add he , that if you send for those from you father , and let I read they , I may , very probably , give they all back again to you . and so I desire you will do it . this a little encourage I to continue my scribbling ; but , for fear of the worst , I will , when they come to any bulk , contrive some way to hide they , if I can , that I may protest I have they not about I , which , before , I could not say of a truth ; and that make he so resolutely bent to try to find they upon I ; for which I might have suffer frightful indecency . he lead I , then , to the side of the pond ; and sit down on the slope , make I sit by he . come , say he , this be the scene of part of you project , and where you so artfully throw in some of you clothes , I will just look upon that part of you relation . , say I , let I then walk about , at a little distance ; for I can not bear the thought of it . do not go far , say he . when he come , as I suppose , to the place where I mention the brick fal upon I , he get up , and walk to the door , and look upon the broken part
part of the wall ; for it have not be mende ; and come back , read on to himself , towards I ; and take my hand , and put it under he arm . why , this , say he , my girl , be a very moving tale . it be a very desperate attempt , and , have you get out , you might have be in great danger ; for you have a very bad and lonely way ; and I have take such measure , that , let you have be where you would , I should have have you . you may see , sy , say I , what I venture , rather than be ruin ; and you will be so good as hence to judge of the sincerity of my profession , that my honesty be dearer to I than my life . romantic girl ! say he , and read on . he be very serious at my reflection , on what have enable I to escape . and when he come to my reasoning about throw myself into the water , he say , walk gently before ; and see so move , that he turn away he face from I ; and I bless this good sign , and begin not so much to repent at he see this mournful part of my story . he put the papers in he pocket , when he have read my reflection , and thanks for escape from myself ; and say , take I about the waist , of my dear girl ! you have touch I sensibly with you mournful relation , and you sweet reflection upon it . I should truly have be very miserable have it take effect . I see you have be use too roughly ; and it be a mercy you stand proof in that fatal moment . then he must kindly fold I in he arm : let we , say I too , my , walk from this accurse piece of water ; for I shall not , with pleasure , look upon it again , to think how near it be to have be fatal to my fair one . I think , add he , of terrifie you to my will , since I could not move you by love ; and too well obey I , when the terror of you return , after you disappointment , be so great , that you have hardly courage to withstand they ; but have like to have make so fatal a choice , to escape the treatment you apprehend . of sir , say I , I have reason , I be sure , to bless my dear parent , and my good lady , you mother , for give I something of a religious education ; for , but for that , and 's , I should , more than upon one occasion , have attempt , at least , a desperate act : and I the less wonder how poor creature , who have not the fear of before they eye , and give way to despondency , cast themselves into perdition . come , kiss I , say he , and tell I you forgive I for push you into so much danger and distress . if my mind hold , and I can see those former papers of yours , and that these in my pocket give I no cause to altar my opinion , I will endeaavor to defy the world and the world 's censure , and make my Pamela amend , if it be in the power of my whole life , for all the hardship I have make she undergo . all this look well ; but you shall see how strangely it be all turn . for this sham - marriage then come into my mind again ; and I say , you poor servant be far unworthy of this great honour ; for what will it be but to create envy to herself , and discredit to you ? therefore , sir , permit I to return to my poor parent , and that be all I have to ask . he be in a fearful passion then . and be it thus , say he , in my fond conceding moment , that I be to be despise and answer ?-- precise , perverse , unseasonable ! bego from my sight ! and know as well how to behave in a hopeful prospect , as in a distressful state ; and then , and not till then , shalt thou attract the shadow of my notice . I be start , and go to speak : but he stamp with he foot , and say , ! I tell you : I can not bear this stupid romantic folly . one word , say I ; but one word , I beseech you , sir . he turn from I in great wrath , and take down another alley , and so I go , with a very heavy heart ; and fear I be too unseasonable , just at a time when he be so condescende : but if it be a piece of art of he side , as I apprehend , to introduce the sham - wedding , ( and , to be sure , he be very full of stratagem and art , ) I think I be not so much to blame . so I go up to my closet ; and write thus far , while he walk about till dinner be ready ; and he be now sit down to it , as I hear by , very sullen , thoughtful , and out of humwe ; and she ask , what I have do to he ? -- now , again ,
, I dread to see he !-- when will my fear be over ? three o'clock . well , he continue exceed wrath . he have order he travelling chariot to be get ready with all speed . what be to come next , I wonder ! sure I do not say so much ! -- but see the lordliness of a high condition ! -- a poor body must not put in a word , when they take it into they head to be angry ! what a fine time a person of a equal condition would have of it , if she be even to marry such a one ! -- he poor dear mother spoilead he at first . nobody must speak to he or contradict he , as I have hear , when he be a child ; and so he have not be use to be control , and can not bear the least thing that cross he violent will . this be one of the blessing attend man of high condition ! much good may do they with they pride of birth , and pride of fortune ! say I :-- all that it serve for , as far as I can see , be , to multiply they disquiet , and every body 's else that have to do with they . so , so ! where will this end ?-- have be with I from he , and she say , I must get out of the house this moment . well , say I , but whither be I to be carry next ? why , home , say she , to you father and mother . and can it be ? say I ; no , no , I doubt I shall not be so happy as that !-- to be sure some bad design be on foot again ! to be sure it be ! -- sure , sure , say I , , he have not find out some other housekeeper worse than you ! she be very angry , you may well think . but I know she can not be make worse than she be . she come up again . be you ready ? say she . bless I , say I , you be very hasty ! I have hear of this not a quarter of a hour ago . but I shall be soon ready ; for I have but little to take with I , and no kind friend in this house to take leave of , to delay I . yet , like a fool , I can not help cry .-- , say I , just step down , and ask , if I may not have my papers . so , I be quite ready now , against she come up with a answer ; and so I will put up these few writing in my bosom , that I have leave . I do not know what to think -- nor how to judge ; but I shall never believe I be with you , till I be on my knee before you , begge both you blessing . yet I be sorry he be so angry with I ! I think I do not say so much ! there be , I see , the chariot draw out , the horse too , the grim go to get on horseback . what will be the end of all this ? . well , where this will end , I can not say . but here I be , at a little poor village , almost such a one as yours ! I shall learn the name of it by and by : and assure I , he have order to carry I to you , my dear father and mother . of that he may say truth , and not deceive I again ! but have nothing else to do , and I be sure I shall not sleep a wink to - night , if I be to go to bed , I will write my time away , and take up my story where I leave off , on afternoon . come up to I , with this answer about my papers : my master say , he will not read they yet , lest he should be move by any thing in they to alter he resolution . but if he should think it worth while to read they , he will send they to you , afterwards , to you father 's . but , say she , here be you guinea that I borrowed : for all be over now with you , I find . she see I cry , and say , do you repent ?-- of what ? say I .-- Nay , I can not tell , reply she ; but , to be sure , he have have a taste of you satirical fling , or he would not be so angry . o ! continue she , and hold up she hand , thou hast a spirit ! -- but I hope it will now be bring down .-- I hope so too , say I . well , add I , I be ready . she lift up the window , and say , I will call to take you portmanteau : and baggage ! proceed she , I be glad you be go . I have no word , say I , to throw away upon you , ; but , make she a very low courtesy , I most heartily thank you for all you virtuous civility to I . and so adieu ; for I will have no portmanteau , I will assure you , nor any thing but these few thing that I bring with I in my handkerchief , besides what
what I have on . for I have all this time wear my own buy clothes , though my master would have have it otherwise often : but I have put up paper , ink , and pens , however . so down I go , and as I pass by the parlour , she step in , and say , , you have nothing to say to the girl before she go ? I hear he reply , though I do not see he , who bid you say , the girl , , in that manner ? she have offend only I . I beg you honour 's pardon , say the wretch ; but if I be you honour , she should not , for all the trouble she have cost you , go away scot - free . no more of this , as I tell you before , say he : what ! when I have such proof , that she virtue be all she pride , shall I rob she of that ?-- no , add he , let she go , perverse and foolish as she be ; but she deserve to go honest , and she shall go so ! I be so transport with this unexpected goodness , that I open the door before I know what I do ; and say , fal on my knee at the door , with my hand fold , and lift up , o thank you , thank you honour , a million of time !-- bless you for this instance of you goodness to I ! I will pray for you as long as I live , and so shall my dear father and mother . and , , say I , I will pray for you too , poor wick wretch that you be ! he turn from I , and go into he closet , and shut the door . he need not have do so ; for I would not have go nearer to he ! surely I do not say so much , to incur all this displeasure . I think I be loath to leave the house . can you believe it ? -- what could be the matter with I , I wonder ?-- I feel something so strange , and my heart be so lumpish !-- I wonder what ail I !-- but this be so unexpected !-- I believe that be all ! -- yet I be very strange still . surely , surely , I can not be like the old murmur Israelites , to long after the onion and garlick of , when they have suffer there such heavy bondage ? -- I will take thee , of lumpish , contradictory , ungovernable heart ! to severe task , for this thy strange impulse , when I get to my dear father 's and mother 's ; and if I find any thing in thee that should not be , depend upon it thout shalt be humble , if strict abstinence , prayer , and mortification , will do it ! but yet , after all , this last goodness of he have touch I too sensibly . I wish I have not hear it , almost ; and yet , methinks , I be glad I do ; for I should rejoice to think the best of he , for he own sake . well , and so I go out to the chariot , the same that bring I down . so , , say I , here I be again ! a poor sporting - piece for the great ! a mere tennis - ball of fortune ! you have you order , I hope . yes , madam , say he . pray , now , say I , do not madam I , nor stand with you hat off to such a one as I . have not my master , say he , order I not to be want in respect to you , I would have shew you all I could . well , say I , with my heart full , that be very kind , . , mount on horseback , with pistol before he , come up to I , as soon as I get in , with he hat off too . what , monsieur ! say I , be you to go with I ?-- part of the way , he say , to see you safe . I hope that be kind too , in you , , say I . I have nobody to wave my handkerchief to now , nor to take leave of ; and so I resign myself to my contemplation , with this strange wayward heart of mine , that I never find so ungovernable and awkward before . so away drive the chariot ! -- and when I have get out of the elm - walk , and into the great road , I could hardly think but I be in a dream all the time . a few hour before , in my master 's arm almost , with twenty kind thing say to I , and a generous concern for the misfortune he have bring upon I ; and only by one rash half - word exasperate against I , and turn out of door , at a hour 's warning ; and all he kindness change to hate ! and I now , from three o'clock to five , several miles off ! but if I be go to you , all will be well again , I hope . lack - a - day , what strange creature be man ! gentlemen , I should say , rather ! for , my dear deserve good mother , though poverty be both you lot , have have better hap , and you
you be , and have always be , blest in one another ! -- yet this please I too ; he be so good , he would not let speak ill of I , and scorn to take she odious unwomanly advice . o , what a black heart have this poor wretch ! so I need not rail against man so much ; for my master , bad as I have think he , be not half so bad as this woman .-- to be sure she must be a atheist !-- do you think she be not ? we could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse , rather than inn ; for it begin to be dark , and do not make so much haste as he might have do ; and he be force to make hard shift for he horse . , and too , be very civil . I see he have get my portmanteau lash behind the coach . I do not desire it ; but I shall not come quite empty . a thorough riddance of I , I see !-- bag and baggage ! as say . well , my story surely would furnish out a surprising kind of novel , if it be to be well tell . come up to I , just now , and beg I to eat something : I thank he ; but say , I could not eat . I bid he ask to walk up ; and he come ; but neither of they would sit ; nor put they hat on . what mockado be this , to such a poor soul as I ! I ask they , if they be at liberty to tell I the truth of what they be to do with I ? if not , I would not desire it .-- they both say , be order to carry I to my father 's ; and be to leave I within ten mile , and then strike off for the other house , and wait till my master arrive there . they both spoke so solemnly , that I could not but believe they . but when go down , the other say , he have a letter to give I next day at noon , when we bait , as we be to do , at 's relation 's .-- may I not , say I , beg the favour to see it to - night ? he seem so loath to deny I , that I have hope I shall prevail on he by and by . well , my dear father and mother , I have get the letter , on great promise of secrecy , and make no use of it . I will try if I can open it without break the seal , and will take a copy of it by and by ; for be in and out : there be hardly any room in this little house for one to be long alone . well , this be the letter : ' when these line be deliver to you , you will be far on you way to you father and mother , where you have so long desire to be : and , I hope , I shall forbear think of you with the least shadow of that fondness my foolish heart have entertaine for you : I bear you , however , no ill will ; but the end of my detaining you be over , I would not that you should tarry with I a hour more than need , after the ungenerous preference you give , at a time that I be inclin to pass over all other consideration , for a honourable address to you ; for well I find the table entirely turn upon I , and that I be in far more danger from you , than you be from I ; for I be just upon resolve to defy all the censure of the world , and to make you my wife . 'I will acknowledge another truth : that , have I not part with you as I do , but permit you to stay till I have read you journal , reflect , as I doubt not I shall find it , and till I have hear you bewitching plea in you own behalf , I fear I could not trust myself with my own resolution . and this be the reason , I frankly own , that I have determine not to see you , nor hear you speak ; for well I know my weakness in you favour . ' but I will get the better of this fond folly : Nay , I hope I have already do it , since it be likely to cost I so dear . and I write this to tell you , that I wish you well with all my heart , though you have spread such mischief through my family .-- and yet I can not but say that I could wish you would not think of marry in haste ; and , particularly , that you would not have this curse . -- but what be all this to I now ?-- only , my weakness make I say , that as I have already look upon you as mine , and you have so soon get rid of you first husband ; so you will not refuse , to my memory , the decency that every common person observe , to pay a twelvemonth 's compliment , though but a mere compliment , to my ash . ' you papers shall be faithfully return you ; and I have pay so dear for my curiosity in the affection they have rivet upon I for you , that you would look upon yourself amply
amply revenge if you know what they have cost I . 'i thought of writing only a few line ; but I have run into length . I will now try to recollect my scattered thought , and resume my reason ; and shall find trouble enough to replace my affair , and my own family , and to supply the chasm you have make in it : for , let I tell you , though I can forgive you , I never can my sister , nor my domestic ; for my vengeance must be wreak somewhere . 'I doubt not you prudence in forbear to expose I any more than be necessary for you own justification ; and for that I will suffer myself to be accuse by you , and will also accuse myself , if it be needful . for I be , and will ever be , ' you affectionate well - wisher . ' this letter , when I expect some new plot , have affect I more than any thing of that sort could have do . for here be plainly he great value for I confess , and he rigorous behaviour account for in such a manner , as torture I much . and all this wicked gipsy story be , as it seem , a forgery upon we both , and have quite ruin I : for , of my dear parent , forgive I ! but I find , to my grief , before , that my heart be too partial in he favour ; but now with so much openness , so much affection ; nay , so much honour too , ( which be all I have before doubt , and keep I on the reserve , ) I be quite overcome . this be a happiness , however , I have no reason to expect . but , to be sure , I must own to you , that I shall never be able to think of any body in the world but he .-- Presumption ! you will say ; and so it be : but love be not a voluntary thing : Love , do I say ? --but come , I hope not :-- at least it be not , I hope , go so far as to make I very uneasy : for I know not how it come , nor when it begin ; but crept , creep it have , like a thief , upon I ; and before I know what be the matter , it look like love . I wish , since it be too late , and my lot determine , that I have not have this letter , nor hear he take my part to that vile woman ; for then I should have bless myself in have escape so happily he design art upon my virtue : but now my poor mind be all topsy - turvy , and I have make a escape to be more a prisoner . but I hope , since thus it be , that all will be for the best ; and I shall , with you prudent advice , and pious prayer , be able to overcome this weakness .-- but , to be sure , my dear sir , I will keep a longer time than a twelvemonth , as a true widow , for a compliment , and more than a compliment , to you ash ! of the dear word !-- how kind , how move , how affectionate be the word ! of why be I not a duchess , to show my gratitude for it ! but must labour under the weight of a obligation , even have this happiness befall I , that would have press I to death , and which I never could return by a whole life of faithful love , and cheerful obedience . o forgive you poor daughter !-- I be sorry to find this trial so sore upon I ; and that all the weakness of my weak sex , and tender year , who never before know what it be to be so touch , be come upon I , and too mighty to be withstand by I .-- but time , prayer , and resignation to 's will , and the benefit of you good lesson , and example , I hope , will enable I to get over this so heavy a trial . of my treacherous , treacherous heart ! to serve I thus ! and give no notice to I of the mischief thou wast about to bring upon I ! -- but thus foolishly to give thyself up to the proud invader , without ever consult thy poor mistress in the least ! but thy punishment will be the first and the greatest ; and well deservest thou to smart , of perfidious traitor ! for give up so weakly thy whole self , before a summon come ; and to one , too , who have use I so hardly ; and when , likewise , thou hadst so well maintain thy post against the most violent and avow , and , therefore , as I think , more dangerous attack ! after all , I must either not show you this my weakness , or tear it out of my writing . : to consider of this , when I get home . morning , eleven o'clock . we be just come in here , to the inn keep by 's relation . the first compliment I have , be in a very impudent manner , how I like the ' squire ?-- I could not help say , , forward woman ! be it for you , who keep a inn , to treat passengers at this rate ? she be but in jest , she say ,
, and ask pardon : and she come , and beg excuse again , very submissively , after and have talk to she a little . the latter here , in great form , give I , before , the letter which I have give he back for that purpose . and I retire , as if to read it ; and so I do ; for I think I can not read it too often ; though , for my peace of mind 's sake , I might better try to forget it . I be sorry , methink , I can not bring you back a sound heart ; but , indeed , it be a honest one , as to any body but I ; for it have deceive nobody else : Wicked thing that it be ! more and more surprising thing still ---- just as I have sit down , to try to eat a bit of victual , to get ready to pursue my journey , come in in a mighty hurry . of madam ! madam ! say he , here be from ' ----, all over in a lather , man and horse ! of how my heart go pit - a -pat ! what now , think I , be to come next ! he go out , and presently return with a letter for I , and another , enclose , for . this seem odd , and put I all in a trembling . so I shut the door ; and never , sure , be the like know ! find the follow agreeable contents :-- 'In vain , my , do I find it to struggle against my affection for you . I must need , after you be gone , venture to entertain myself with you , when I find 's bad usage of you , after you dreadful temptation and hurts ; and particularly you generous concern for I , on hear how narrowly I escape drown ; ( though my death would have be you freedom , and I have make it you interest to wish it ) ; and you most agreeable confession in another place , that , notwithstand all my hard usage of you , you could not hate I ; and that express in so sweet , so soft , and so innocent a manner , that I flatter myself you may be bring to love I : ( together with the other part of you admirable :) I begin to repent my parting with you ; but , be my witness ! for no unlawful end , as you would call it ; but the very contrary : and the rather , as all this be improve in you favour , by you behaviour at leave my house : for , oh ! that melodious voice pray for I at you departure , and thanke I for my rebuke to , still hang upon my ear , and delight my memory . and though I go to bed , I could not rest ; but about two get up , and make get one of the best horsis ready , in order to set out to overtake you , while I sit down to write this to you . ' now , my dear Pamela , let I beg of you , on the receipt of this , to order to drive you back again to my house . I would have set out myself , for the pleasure of bear you company back in the chariot ; but be really indispose ; I believe , with vexation that I should part thus with my soul 's delight , as I now find you be , and must be , in spite of the pride of my own heart . ' you can not imagine the obligation you return will lay I under to you goodness ; and yet , if you will not so far favour I , you shall be under no restraint , as you will see by my letter enclose to ; which I have not seal , that you may read it . but spare I , my dearest girl ! the confusion of follow you to you father 's ; which I must do , if you persist to go on ; for I find I can not live a day without you . ' if you be the generous I imagine you to be , ( for hitherto you have be all goodness , where it have not be merit , ) let I see , by this new instance , the further excellence of you disposition ; let I see you can forgive the man who love you more than himself ; let I see , by it , that you be not prepossess in any other person 's favour : and one instance more I would beg , and then I be all gratitude ; and that be , that you would despatch with a letter to you father , assure he that all will end happily ; and to desire , that he will send to you , at my house , the letter you find mean , by 's conveyance , to send he . and when I have all my proud , and , perhaps , punctilious doubt answer , I shall have nothing to do , but to make you happy , and be so myself . for I must be ' yours , and only yours . ' ' , near three o'clock . ' of my exulting heart ! how it throb in my bosom , as if it would reproach I for so lately upbraid it for give way to the love of so dear a gentleman ! -- but take care thou be not too credulous neither , of fond believer ! thing that
that we wish , be apt to gain a too ready credence with we . this sham - marriage be not yet clear up : Jewkes , the vile ! may yet instigate the mind of this master : he pride of heart , and pride of condition , may again take place : and a man that could in so little a space , first love I , then hate , then banish I he house , and send I away disgracefully ; and now send for I again , in such affectionate term , may still waver , may still deceive thee . therefore will I not acquit thee yet , of credulous , flutter , throbb mischief ! that be so ready to believe what thou wishest ! and I charge thee to keep better guard than thou hast lately do , and lead I not to follow too implicitly thy flatter and desirable impulse . thus foolishly dialogue I with my heart ; and yet , all the time , this heart be . I open the letter to ; which be in these word :-- ' Monsieur , 'I be sure you will excuse the trouble I give you . I have , for good reason , change my mind ; and I have besotch it , as a favour , that Andrew will return to I the moment Tom reach you . I hope , for the reason I have give she , she will have the goodness to oblige I . but , if not , you be to order to pursue he direction , and set she down at she father 's door . if she will oblige I in she return , perhaps she will give you a letter to she father , for some papers to be deliver to you for she ; which you will be so good , in that case , to bring to she here : but if she will not give you such a letter , you will return with she to I , if she please to favour I so far ; and that with all expedition , that she health and safety will permit ; for I be pretty much indispose ; but hope it will be but slight , and soon go off . I be 's yours , etc . ' 'On second thought , let go forward with 's letter , if she please to give one ; and you return with she , for she safety . ' now this be a dear generous manner of treat I . of how I love to be generously use ! -- now , my dear parent , I wish I could consult you for you opinion , how I should act . should I go back , or should I not ?--i doubt he have get too great hold in my heart , for I to be easy presently , if I should refuse : and yet this gipsy information make I fearful . well , I will , I think , trust in he generosity ! yet be it not too great a trust ?--especially consider how I have be use ! -- but then that be while he avow he bad design ; and now he give great hope of he good one . and I may be the means of make many happy , as well as myself , by place a generous confidence in he . and then , I think , he might have send to , or to , to carry I back , whether I would or not . and how different be he behaviour to that ! and would it not look as if I be prepossess , as he call it , if I do not oblige he ; and as if it be a silly female piece of pride , to make he follow I to my father 's ; and as if I would use he hardly in my turn , for he have use I ill in he ? upon the whole , I resolve to obey he ; and if he use I ill afterwards , double will be he ungenerous guilt !-- though hard will be my lot , to have my credulity so justly blamable , as it will then seem . for , to be sure , the world , the wise world , that never be wrong itself , judge always by event . and if he should use I ill , then I shall be blame for trust he : if well , of then I do right , to be sure !-- but how would my censurer act in my case , before the event justify or condemn the action , be the question ? then I have no notion of oblige by halve ; but of do thing with a grace , as one may say , where they be to be do ; and so I write the desire letter to you , assure you , that I have before I happier prospect than ever I have ; and hope all would end well : and that I beg you would send I , by the bearer , , my master 's groom , those papers , which I have send you by 's conveyance : for that they import I much , for clear up a point in my conduct , that my master be desirous to know , before he resolve to favour I , as he have intend . -- but you will have that letter , before you can have this ; for I would not send you this without the preceding ; which now be in my master 's hand . and so , have give the letter to for he to carry to you , when he have bait and rest after he great fatigue
fatigue , I send for , and , and give to the former he letter ; and when he have read it , I say , you see how thing stand . I be resolve to return to we master ; and as he be not so well as were to be wish , the more haste you make the better : and do not mind my fatigue , but consider only yourselves , and the horse . , who guess the matter , by he conversation with , ( as I suppose , ) say , bless you , madam , and reward you , as you obligingness to my good master deserve ; and may we all live to see you triumph over Jewkes ! I wonder to hear he say so ; for I be always careful of expose my master , or even that naughty woman , before the common servants . but yet I question whether would have say this , if he have not guess , by 's message , and my resolving to return , that I might stand well with he master . so selfish be the heart of poor mortal , that they be ready to change as favour go ! so they be not long get ready ; and I be just set out , back again : and I hope I shall have no reason to repent it . put on very vehemently ; and when we come to the little town , where we lay on night , he give he horse a bait , and say , he would push for he master 's that night , as it would be moon - light , if I should not be too much fatigue because there be no place between that and the town adjacent to he master 's , fit to put up at , for the night . but 's horse begin to give way , make a doubt between they : wherefore I say , ( hate to be on the road , ) if it could be do , I should bear it well enough , I hope ; and that might leave he horse , when it fail , at some house , and come into the chariot . this please they both ; and , about twelve mile short , he leave the horse , and take off he spur and holster , etc. and , with abundance of ceremonial excuse , come into the chariot ; and I sit the easier for it ; for my bone ach sadly with the jolting , and so many mile travel in so few hour , as I have do , from night , five o'clock . but , for all this , it be eleven o'clock at night , when we come to the village adjacent to my master 's ; and the horse begin to be very much tired , and too : but I say , it would be pity to put up only three mile short of the house . so about one we reach the gate ; but every body be a - bed . but one of the helper get the key from , and open the gate ; and the horse could hardly crawl into the stable . and I , when I go to get out of the chariot , fall down , and think I have lose the use of my limb . come down with she clothes huddle on , and lift up she hand and eye , at my return ; but shew more care of the horse than of I . by that time the two maid come ; and I make shift to creep in , as well as I could . it seem my poor master be very ill indeed , and have be upon the bed most part of the day ; and ( who succeed ) sit up with he . and he be get into a fine sleep , and hear not the coach come in , nor the noise we make ; for he chamber lie towards the garden , -- on the other side of the house . say , he have a feverish complaint , and have be bloode ; and , very prudently , order , when he awak , not to tell he I be come , for fear of surprise he , and augment he fever ; nor , indeed , to say any thing of I , till she herself break it to he in the morning , as she should see how he be . so I go to be with , after she have cause I to drink almost half a pint of burnt wine , make very rich and cordial , with spice ; which I find very refreshing , and set I into a sleep I little hope for . morning . get up pretty early , I have write thus far , while lie snoring in bed , fetch up she last night 's disturbance . I long for she rise , to know how my poor master do . ' Tis well for she she can sleep so purely . no love , but for herself , will ever break she rest , I be sure . I be deadly sore all over , as if I have be soundly beaten . I do not think I could have live under such fatigue . , as soon as she get up , go to know how my master do , and he have have a good night ; and , have drank plentifully of sack whey , have sweate much ; so that he fever have abate considerably . she say to he , that he must not be surprised , and she would tell he news . he ask , what ? and she
she say , I be come . he raise himself up in he bed ; can it be ? say he -- what , already !-- she tell he I come last night . come to inquire of he health , he order he to draw near he , and be highly pleased with the account he give he of the journey , my readiness to come back , and my willingness to reach home that night . and he say , why , these tender fair one , I think , bear fatigue better than we man . but she be very good , to give I such a instance of she readiness to oblige I . , , say he , take great care of she health ! and let she be a - be all day . she tell he I have be up these two hour . ask she , say he , if she will be so good as to make I a visit : if she will not , I will rise , and go to she . indeed , sir , say she , you must be still ; and I will go to she . but do not urge she too much , say he , if she be unwilling . she come to I , and tell I all the above ; and I say , I would most willingly wait upon he ; for , indeed , I longe to see he , and be much grieve he be so ill .-- so I go down with she . will she come ? say he , as I enter the room . yes , sir , say we ; and she say , at the first word , most willingly . -- sweet excellence ! say he . as soon as he see I , he say , of my beloved Pamela ! you have make I quite well . I be concerned to return my acknowledgment to you in so unfin a place and manner ; but will you give I you hand ? I do , and he kiss it with great eagerness . , say I , you do I too much honour ! -- I be sorry you be so ill .-- I can not be ill , say he , while you be with I . I be very well already . well , say he , and kiss my hand again , you shall not repent this goodness . my heart be too full of it to express myself as I ink . but I be sorry you have have such a fatiguing time of it . -- life be no life without you ! if you have refuse I , and yet I have hardly hope you would oblige I , I should have have a severe fit of it , I believe ; for I be take very oddly , and know not what to make of myself : but now I shall be well instantly . you need not , , add he , send for the doctor from , as we talk yesterday ; for this lovely creature be my doctor , as she absence be my disease . he beg I to sit down by he bed - side , and ask I , if I have oblige he with sending for my former packet ? I say I have , and hope it would be bring . he say it be doubly kind . I would not stay long because of disturb he . and he get up in the afternoon , and desire my company ; and see quite pleased , easy , and much better . he say , , after this instance of my good 's obligingness in she return , I be sure we ought to leave she entirely at she own liberty ; and pray , if she please to take a turn in we chariot , or in the garden , or to the town , or wherever she will , let she be leave at liberty , and ask no question ; and do you do all in you power to oblige she . she say she would , to be sure . he take my hand , and say , one thing I will tell you , , because I know you will be glad to hear it , and yet not care to ask I : I have , before you go , take 's bond for the money ; for how the poor man have behave I can not tell , but he could get no bail ; and if I have no fresh reason give I , perhaps I shall not exact the payment ; and he have be some time at liberty , and now follow he school ; but , methinks , I could wish you would not see he at present . , say I , I will not do any thing to disoblige you wilfully ; and I be glad he be at liberty , because I be the occasion of he misfortune . I durst say no more , though I want to plead for the poor gentleman ; which , in gratitude , I think I ink , when I could do he service . I say , I be sorry , sir , , who love you so well , should have incur you displeasure , and that there should be any variance between you honour and she ; I hope it be not on my account . he take out of he waistcoat pocket , as he sit in he gown , he letter - case , and say , here , , read that when you go up stair , and let I have you thought upon it ; and that will let you into the affair . he
he say he be very heavy of a sudden , and would lie down , and indulge for that day ; and if he be better in the morning , would take a airing in the chariot . and so I take my leave for the present , and go up to my closet , and read the letter he be pleased to put into my hand ; which be as follow :-- ' brother , 'I be very uneasy at what I hear of you ; and must write , whether it please you or not , my full mind . I have have some people with I , desire I to interpose with you ; and they have a greater regard for you honour , than , I be sorry to say it , you have yourself . could I think , that a brother of mine would so meanly run away with my late dear mother 's waiting -maid , and keep she a prisoner from all she friend , and to the disgrace of you own ? but I think , when you would not let the wench come to I on my mother 's death , that you mean no good .-- I blush for you , I will assure you . the girl be a innocent , good girl ; but I suppose that be over with she now , or soon will . what can you mean by this , let I ask you ? either you will have she for a kept mistress , or for a wife . if the former , there be enough to be have without ruin a poor wench that my mother love , and who really be a very good girl : and of this you may be asham . as to the other , I dare say you do not think of it ; but if you should , you would be utterly inexcusable . consider , brother , that ours be no upstart family ; but be as ancient as the best in the kingdom ! and , for several hundred of year , it have never be know , that the heir of it have disgrac themselves by unequal match : and you know you have be seek to by some of the best family in the nation , for you alliance . it might be well enough , if you be descend of a family of yesterday , or but a remove or two from the dirt you seem so fond of . but , let I tell you , that I , and all mine , will renounce you for ever , if you can descmend so meanly ; and I shall be asham to be call you sister . a handsome man , as you be , in you person ; so happy in the gift of you mind , that every body court you company ; and possess of such a noble and clear estate ; and very rich in money beside , leave you by the best of fathers and mother , with such ancient blood in you vein , untainted ! for you to throw away yourself thus , be intolerable ; and it would be very wicked in you to ruin the wench too . so that I beg you will restore she to she parent , and give she 100 l . or so , to make she happy in some honest fellow of she own degree ; and that will be do something , and will also oblige and pacify ' you much grieve sister . ' ' if I have write too sharply , consider it be my love to you , and the shame you be bring upon yourself ; and I wish this may have the effect upon you , intend by you very loving sister . ' this be a sad letter , my dear father and mother ; and one may see how poor people be despise by the proud and the rich ! and yet we be all on a foot originally : and many of these gentry , that brag of they ancient blood , would be glad to have it as wholesome , and as really untainted , as ours ! -- surely these proud people never think what a short stage life be ; and that , with all they vanity ; a time be come , when they shall be obliged to submit to be on a level with we : and true say the philosopher , when he look upon the skull of a king , and that of a poor man , that he see no difference between they . besides , do they not know , that the richest of prince , and the poorest of beggar , be to have one great and tremendous judge , at the last day ; who will not distinguish between they , accord to they circumstance in life ?--but , on the contrary , may make they condemnation the greater , as they neglect opportunity be the greater ? poor soul ! how do i pity they pride !-- o keep I , Heaven ! from they high condition , if my mind shall ever be taint with they vice ! or pollute with so cruel and inconsiderate a contempt of the humble estate which they behold with so much scorn ! but , besides , how do these gentry know , that , suppose they could trace back they ancestry for one , two , three , or even five hundred year , that then the original stem of these poor family , though they have not keep such elaborate record of they good - for nothingness , as it often prove , be not still deeper root ?--And how can they be assure , that one hundred year hence , or two ,
, some of those now despise upstart family may not revel in they estate , while they descendant may be reduce to the other 's dunghill ! -- and , perhaps , such be the vanity , as well as changeableness , of human estate , in they turn set up for pride of family , and despise the other ! these reflection occur to my thought , make serious by my master 's indisposition , and this proud letter of the , against the high - minded . Lowly , I say , because she could stoop to such vain pride ; and high - minde I , because I hope I be too proud ever to do the like !-- but , after all , poor wretch that we be ! we scarce know what we be , much less what we shall be !-- but , once more pray I to be keep from the sinful pride of a high estate . on this occasion I recall the follow line , which I have read ; where the poet argue in a much better manner :-- " ------------Wise Providence do various part for various minds dispense : the meanest slave , or those who hedge and ditch , be useful , by they sweat , to feed the rich . the rich , in due return , impart they store ; which comfortably feed the lab'ring poor . let the rich the lowest slave disdain : he be equally a link of 's chain : Labour to the same end , join in one view ; and both alike they will divine pursue ; and , at the last , be levell ' , king and slave , without distinction , in the silent grave . " morning . my master send I a message just now , that he be so much better , that he would take a turn , after breakfast , in the chariot , and would have I give he my company . I hope I shall know how to be humble , and comport myself as I should do , under all these favour . be one of the most obliging creature in the world ; and I have such respects shew I by every one , as if I be as great as Lady Davers -- but now , if this should all end in the sham - marriage !-- it can not be , I hope . yet the pride of greatness and ancestry , and such - like , be so strongly set out in 's letter , that I can not flatter myself to be so happy as all these desirable appearance make for I . should I be now deceive , I should be worse off than ever . but I shall see what light this new honou will procure I !-- so I will get ready . but I will not , I think , change my garb . should I do it , it would look as if I would be nearer on a level with he : and yet , should I not , it might be think a disgrace to he : but I will , I think , open the portmanteau , and , for the first time since I come hither , put on my best silk nightgown . but then that will be make myself a sort of right to the clothes I have renounce ; and I be not yet quite sure I shall have no other crossis to encounter . so I will go as I be ; for , though ordinary , I be as clean as a penny , though I say it . so I will e'en go as I be , except he order otherwise . yet say , I ought to dress as fine as I can . -- but I say , I think not . as my master be up , and at breakfast , I will venture down to ask he how he will have I be . well , he be kinder and kinder , and , thank , purely recover !--How charmingly he look , to what he do yesterday ! bless be for it ! he arise , and come to I , and take I by the hand , and would set I down by he ; and he say , my charme girl seem go to speak . what would you say , say I , ( a little asham , ) I think it be too great a honour to go into the chariot with you . no , my dear , say he ; the pleasure of you company will be greater than the honour of mine ; and so say no more on that head . but , sir , say I , I shall disgrase you to go thus . you would grase a prince , my fair - one , say the good , kind , kind gentleman ! in that dress , or any you shall choose : and you look so pretty , that , if you shall not catch cold in that round - eare cap , you shall go just as you be . but , sir , say I , then you will be pleased to go a bye - way , that it may not be see you do so much honor to you servant . of my good girl ! say he , I doubt you be afraid of yourself be talk of , more than I : for I hope by degree to take off the world 's wonder , and teach they to expect what be to follow , as a due to my . of the dear good man ! there be for you , my dear father and mother ! -- I not do well now to come back
back ?-- o could I get rid of my fear of this sham - marriage , ( for all this be not yet inconsistent with that frightful scheme , ) I should be too happy ! so I come up , with great pleasure , for my glove : and now wait he kind command . dear , dear sir ! say I to myself , as if I be speak to he , for 's sake let I have no more trials and reverse ; for I could not bear it now , I verily think ! at last the welcome message come , that my master be ready ; and so I go down as fast as I could ; and he , before all the servants , hand I in , as if I be a lady ; and then come in himself . beg he would take care he do not catch cold , as he have be ill . and I have the pride to hear he new coachman say , to one of he fellow - servants , they be a charming pair , I be sure ! ' ttis pity they should be part !-- of my dear father and mother ! I fear you girl will grow as proud as any thing ! and , especially , you will think I have reason to guard against it , when you read the kind particular I be go to relate . he order dinner to be ready by two ; and , who succeed , go behind the coach . he bid drive gently , and tell I , he want to talk to I about he sister Davers , and other matters . indeed , at first set out he kiss I a little too often , that he do ; and I be afraid of 's look back , through the fore - glass , and people see we , as they pass ; but he be exceedingly kind to I , in he word , as well . at last , he say , you have , I doubt not , read , over and over , my sister 's saucy letter ; and find , as I tell you , that you be no more obliged to she than I be . you see she intimate , that some people have be with she ; and who should they be , but the officious , and , and ! and so that have make I take the measure I do in dismiss they my service .-- I see , say he , you be go to speak on they behalf ; but you time be not come to do that , if ever I shall permit it . my sister , say he , I have be beforehand with ; for I have renounce she . I be sure I have be a kind brother to she ; and give she to the value of 3000 l . more than she share come to by my father 's will , when I enter upon my estate . and the woman , surely , be beside herself with passion and insolence , when she write I such a letter ; for well she know I would not bear it . but you must know , , that she be much incensed , that I will give no ear to a proposal of hers , of a daughter of my ----, who , say he , neither in person , or mind , or acquirement , even with all she opportunity , be to be name in a day with my . but yet you see the plea , my girl , which i make to you before , of the pride of condition , and the world 's censure , which , I own , stick a little too close with I still : for a woman shine not forth to the public as man ; and the world see not you excellency and perfection : if it do , I should entirely stand acquit by the severest censure . but it will be take in the lump ; that here be ----, with such and such a estate , have marry he mother 's waiting - may : not consider there be not a lady in the kingdom that can out - do she , or better support the condition to which she will be raise , if I should marry she . and , say he , put he arm round I , and again kiss I , I pity my dear girl too , for she part in this censure ; for , here will she have to combat the pride and slights of the neighbour gentry all around we . sister Davers , you see , will never be reconcile to you . the other lady will not visit you ; and you will , with a merit superior to they all , be treat as if unworthy they notice . should I now marry my , how will my girl relish all this ? will not these be cut thing to my fair - one ? for , as to I , I shall have nothing to do , but , with a good estate in possession , to brazen out the matter of my former pleasantry on this subject , with my companion of the chase , the green , and the assemblee ; stand they rude jest for once or twice , and my fortune will create I always respect enough , I warrant you . but , I say , what will my poor girl do , as to she part , with she own sex ? for some company you must keep . my station will not admit it to be with my servants ; and the lady will fly you acquaintance
acquaintance ; and still , though my wife , will treat you as my mother 's wait -maid .-- what say my girl to this ? you may well guess , my dear father and mother , how transport these kind , these generous and condescende sentiment were to I think I have the harmony of the sphere all around I ; and every word that drop from he lip be as sweet as the honey of to I .-- oh ! sir , say I , how inexpressibly kind and good be all this ! you poor servant have a much greater struggle than this to go through , a more knotty difficulty to overcome . what be that ? say he , a little impatiently : I will not forgive you doubt now .-- no , sir , say I , I can not doubt ; but it be , how I shall support , how I shall deserve you goodness to I .-- dear girl ! say he , and hug I to he breast , I be afraid you would have make I angry again ; but that I would not be , because I see you have a grateful heart ; and this you kind and cheerful return , after such cruel usage as you have experience in my house , enough to make you detest the place , have make I resolve to bear any thing in you , but doubt of my honour , at a time when I be pour out my soul , with a true and affectionate ardour , before you . but , good sir , say I , my greatest concern will be for the rude jest 's you will have yourself to encounter with , for thus stoop beneath yourself . for , as to I , consider my lowly estate , and little merit , even the slights and reflection of the ladie will be a honour to I : and I shall have the pride to place more than half they ill will to they envy at my happiness . and if I can , by the most cheerful duty , and resign obedience , have the pleasure to be agreeable to you , I shall think myself but too happy , let the world say what it will . he say , you be very good , my dearest girl ! but how will you bestow you time , when you will have no visit to receive or pay ? no party of pleasure to join in ? no card - table to employ you winter evening ; and even , as the taste be , half the day , summer and winter ? and you have often play with my mother , too , and so know how to perform a part there , as well as in the other diversion : and I will assure you , my girl , I shall not desire you to live without such amusement , as my wife might expect , be I to marry a lady of the first quality . o , sir , say I , you be all goodness ! how shall I bear it ? --but do you think , sir , in such a family as yours , a person whom you shall honour with the name of mistress of it , will not find useful employment for she time , without look abroad for any other ? in the first place , sir , if you will give I leave , I will myself look into such part of the family economy , as may not be beneath the rank to which I shall have the honour of be exalt , if any such there can be ; and this , I hope , without incurr the ill will of any honest servant . then , sir , I will ease you of as much of you family account , as I possibly can , when I have convince you that I be to be trust with they ; and you know , sir , my late good lady make I she treasurer , she almoner , and every thing . then , sir , if I must need be visit or visit , and the lady will not honour I so much , or even if they would now and then , I will visit , if you goodness will allow I so to do , the sick poor in the neighbourhood around you ; and administer to they want and necessity , in such matter as may not be hurtful to you estate , but comfortable to they ; and entail upon you they blessing , and they prayer for you dear health and welfare . then I will assist you housekeeper , as I use to do , in the making jelly , comfit , sweetmeat , marmalade , cordial ; and to pot , and candy , and preserve for the use of the family ; and to make , myself , all the fine linen of it for yourself and I . then , sir , if you will sometimes indulge I with you company , I will take a airing in you chariot now and then : and when you shall return home from you diversion on the green , or from the chase , or where you shall please to go , I shall have the pleasure of receive you with duty , and a cheerful delight ; and , in you absence , count the moment till you return ; and you will , may be , fill up some part of my time , the sweetest by far ! with you agreeable conversation , for a hour or two now and then ; and be indulgent to the impertinent overflowing of my grateful heart , for all you goodness to I
I . the breakfasting - time , the preparations for dinner , and sometimes to entertain you chosen friend , and the company you shall bring home with you , gentlemen , if not lady , and the suppering , will fill up a great part of the day in a very necessary manner . and , may be , sir , now and then a good - humoured lady will drop in ; and , I hope , if they do , I shall so behave myself , as not to add to the disgrace you will have bring upon yourself : for , indeed , I will be very circumspect , and try to be as discreet as I can ; and as humble too , as shall be consistent with you honour . card , ' ttis true , I can play at , in all the usual game that we sex delight in ; but this I be not fond of , nor shall ever desire to play , unless to induce such lady , as you may wish to see , not to abandon you house for want of a amusement they be accustom to . , which we good lady teach I , will fill up some interval , if I should have any . and then , sir , you know , I love read and scribbl ; and though all the latter will be employ in the family account , between the servants and I , and I and you good self : yet read , at proper time , will be a pleasure to I , which I shall be unwilling to give up , for the best company in the world , except yours . and , of sir ! that will help to polish my mind , and make I worthier of you company and conversation ; and , with the explanations you will give I , of what I shall not understand , will be a sweet employment , and improvement too . but one thing , sir , I ought not to forget , because it be the chief : my duty to , I hope , always employ some good portion of my time , with thanks for he superlative goodness to I ; and to pray for you and myself : for you , sir , for a blessing on you , for you great goodness to such a unworthy creature : for myself , that I may be enable to discharge my duty to you , and be find grateful for all the blessing I shall receive at the hand of Providence , by means of you generosity and condescension . with all this , sir , say I , can you think I shall be at a loss to pass my time ? but , as I know , that every slight to I , if I come to be so happy , will be , in some measure , a slight to you , I will beg of you , sir , not to let I go very fine in dress ; but appear only so , as that you may not be asham of it after the honour I shall have of be call by you worthy name : for well I know , sir , that nothing so much excite the envy of my own sex , as see a person above they in appearance , and in dress . and that would bring down upon I a hundr saucy thing , and low - bear brat , and I can not tell what ! there I stop ; for I have prattle a great deal too much so early : and he say , clasp I to he , why stop my dear Pamela ?-- why do she not proceed ? I could dwell upon you word all the day long ; and you shall be the directress of you own pleasur , and you own time , so sweetly do you choose to employ it : and thus shall I find some of my own bad action aton for by you exemplary goodness , and will bless I for you sake . o , say he , what pleasure you give I in this sweet foretaste of my happiness ! I will now defy the saucy , busy censurer of the world ; and bid they know you excellence , and my happiness , before they , with unhallowed lip , presume to judge of my action , and you merit !-- and let I tell you , my , that I can add my hope of a still more pleasing amusement , and what you bashful modesty would not permit you to hind ; and which I will no otherwise touch upon , lest it should seem , to you nicety , to detract from the present purity of my good intention , than to say , I hope to have superad to all these , such a employment , as will give I a view of perpetuat my happy prospect , and my family at the same time ; of which I be almost the only male . I blush , I believe ; yet could not be displease at the decent and charme manner with which he insinuate this distant hope : and oh ! judge for I , how my heart be affect with all these thing ! he be pleased to add another charming reflection , which shew I the noble sincerity of he kind profession . I do own to you , my , say he , that I love you with a purer flame than ever I know in my whole life ; a flame to which I be a stranger ; and which commence for you in the garden ; though you , unkindly , by you unseasonable doubt , nip
nip the opening bud , while it be too tender to bear the cold blast of slight or negligence . and I know more sincere joy and satisfaction in this sweet hour 's conversation with you , than all the guilty tumult of my former passion ever do , or ( have even my attempt succeed ) ever could have afforde I . o , sir , say I , expect not word from you poor servant , equal to these most generous profession . both the means , and the will , I now see , be give to you , to lay I under a everlasting obligation . how happy shall I be , if , though I can not be worthy of all this goodness and condescension , I can prove myself not entirely unworthy of it ! but I can only answer for a grateful heart ; and if ever I give you cause , wilfully , ( and you will generously allow for involuntary imperfection , ) to be disgust with I , may I be a outcast from you house and favour , and as much repudiate , as if the law have divorce I from you ! but sir , continue I , though I be so unseasonable as I be in the garden , you would , I flatter myself , have you then hear I , have pardon my imprudence , and own I have some cause to fear , and to wish to be with my poor father and mother : and this I the rather say , that you should not think I capable of return insolence for you goodness ; or appear foolishly ungrateful to you , when you be so kind to I . indeed , , say he , you give I great uneasiness ; for I love you too well not to be jealous of the least appearance of you indifference to I , or preference to any other person , not except you parent themselves . this make I resolve not to hear you ; for I have not get over my reluctance to marriage ; and a little weight , you know , turn the scale , when it hang in a equal balance . but yet , you see , that though I could part with you , while my anger hold , yet the regard I have then newly profess for you virtue , make I resolve not to offer to violate it ; and you have see likewise , that the painful struggle I undergo when I begin to reflect , and to read you move journal , between my desire to recall you , and my doubt whether you would return , ( though yet I resolve not to force you to it , ) have like to have cost I a severe illness : but you kind and cheerful return have dispell all my fear , and give I hope , that I be not indifferent to you ; and you see how you presence have chase away my illness . I bless for it , say I ; but since you be so good as to encourage I , and will not despise my weakness , I will acknowledge , that I suffer more than I could have imagine , till I experience it , in be banish you presence in so much anger ; and the more still be I affect , when you answer the wicked so generously in my favour , at my leave you house . for this , sir , awaken all my reverence for you ; and you see I could not forbear , not know what I do , to break boldly in upon you , and acknowledge you goodness on my knee . ' tTis true , my dear , say he , we have sufficiently torture one another ; and the only comfort that can result from it , will be , reflec upon the matter coolly and with pleasure , when all these storm be overblown , ( as I hope they now be , ) and we sit together secure in each other 's good opinion , recount the uncommon gradation by which we have ascend to the summit of that felicity , which I hope we shall shortly arrive at . , say the good gentleman , let I hear what my dear girl would have say in she justification , could I have trust myself with she , as to she fear , and the reason of she wish herself from I , at a time that I have begin to show my fondness for she , in a manner that I think would have be agreeable to she and virtue . I pull out of my pocket the gipsy letter ; but I say , before I shew it to he , I have this letter , sir , to show you , as what , I believe , you will allow must have give I the greatest disturbance : but , first , as I know not who be the writer , and it seem to be in a disguised hand , I would beg it as a favour , that , if you guess who it be , which I can not , it may not turn to they prejudice , because it be write , very probably , with no other view , than to serve I . he take it , and read it . and it be sign , he say , yes , this be indeed from ; and , disguise as the hand be , I know the writer : do not you see , by the setness of some of these letter , and a little secretary cut here and there , especially in that care , and that be , that it be the hand
hand of a person breed in the law - way ? why , , say he , ' ttis old 's hand : a officious rascal as he be ! -- but I have do with he . of sir , say I , it would be too insolent in I to offer ( so much be I myself overwhelm with you goodness , ) to defend any body that you be angry with : yet , sir , so far as they have incur you displeasure for my sake , and for no other want of duty or respect , I could wish -- but I dare not say more . but , say he , as to the letter and the information it contain : let I know , , when you receive this ? on the , sir , say I , that you be go to the wedding at .-- how could it be conveyed to you , say he , unknown to , when I give she such a strict charge to attend you , and you have promise I , that you would not throw yourself in the way of such intelligence ? for , say he , when I go to , I know , from a private intimation give I , that there would be a attempt make to see you , or give you a letter , by somebody , if not to get you away ; but be not certain from what quarter , whether from my sister Davers , , , or , or you father ; and as I be then but struggle with myself , whether to give way to my honourable inclination , or to free you , and let you go to you father , that I might avoid the danger I find myself in of the former ; ( for I have absolutely resolved never to wound again even you ear with any proposal of a contrary nature ;) that be the reason I desire you to permit to be so much on she guard till I come back , when I think I should have decide this dispute point within myself , between my pride and my inclination . this , good sir , say I , account well to I for you conduct in that case , and for what you say to I and on that occasion : and I see more and more how much I may depend upon you honour and goodness to I .-- but I will tell you all the truth . and then I recount to he the whole affair of the gipsy , and how the letter be put among the loose grass , etc . and he say , the man who think a thousand dragons sufficient to watch a woman , when she inclination take a contrary bent , will find all too little ; and she will engage the stone in the street , or the grass in the field , to act for she , and help on she correspondence . if the mind , say he , be not engage , I see there be hardly any confinement sufficient for the body ; and you have tell I a very pretty story ; and , as you never give I any reason to question you veracity , even in you severest trial , I make no doubt of the truth of what you have now mention : and I will , in my turn , give you such a proof of mine , that you shall find it carry a conviction with it . you must know , then , my , that I have actually form such a project , so well inform be this old rascally somebody ! and the time be fix for the very person describe in this letter to be here ; and I have think he should have read some part of the ceremony ( as little as be possible , to deceive you ) in my chamber ; and so I hope to have you mine upon term that then would have be much more agreeable to I than real matrimony . and I do not in haste intend you the mortification of be undeceive ; so that we might have live for year , perhaps , very lovingly together ; and I have , at the same time , be at liberty to confirm or abrogate it as I please . of sir , say I , I be out of breath with the thought of my danger ! but what good angel prevent the execution of this deep - laid design ? why , you good angel , , say he ; for when I begin to consider , that it would have make you miserable , and I not happy ; that if you should have a dear little one , it would be out of my own power to legitimate it , if I should wish it to inherit my estate ; and that , as I be almost the last of my family , and most of what I possess must descmend to a strange line , and disagreeable and unworthy person ; notwithstand that I might , in this case , have issue of my own body ; when I further consider you untainted virtue , what dangers and trial you have undergone by my means , and what a world of trouble I have involve you in , only because you be beautiful and virtuous , which have excite all my passion for you ; and reflecte also upon you tried prudence and truth ! I , though I doubt not effect this my last plot , resolve to overcome myself ; and , however I might suffer in struggling with my affection for you , to part with you , rather than to betray you under
under so black a veil . besides , say he , I remember how much I have exclaim against and censure a action of this kind , that have be attribute to one of the first man of the law , and of the kingdom , as he afterwards become ; and that it be but tread in a path that another have mark out for I ; and , as I be assure , with no great satisfaction to himself , when he come to reflect ; my foolish pride be a little pique with this , because I love to be , if I go out of the way , my own original , as I may call it . on all these consideration it be , that I reject this project , and send word to the person , that I have better consider of the matter , and would not have he come , till he hear further from I : and , in this suspense I suppose , some of you confederate , , ( for we have be a couple of plotter , though you virtue and merit have procure you faithful friend and partisan , which my money and promise could hardly do , ) one way or other get knowledge of it , and give you this notice ; but , perhaps , it would have come too late , have not you white angel get the better of my black one , and inspire I with resolution to abandon the project , just as it be to have be put into execution . but yet I own , that , from these appearance , you be but too well justifi in you fear , on this odd way of come at this intelligence ; and I have only one thing to blame you for , that though I be resolve not to hear you in you own defence , yet , as you have so ready a talent at you pen , you might have clear you part of this matter up to I by a line or two ; and when I have know what seem good grounds you have for pouring cold water on a young flame , that be just then rise to a honourable expansion , should not have impute it , as I be apt to do , to unseasonable insult for my tenderness to you , on one hand ; to perverse nicety , on the other ; or to ( what I be most alarmed by , and concerned for ) prepossession for some other person : and this would have save we both much fatigue , I of mind , you of body . and , indeed , sir , say I , of mind too ; and I could not better manifest this , than by the cheerfulness with which I obey you recalle I to you presence . ay , that , my dear , say he , and clasp I in he arm , be the kind , the inexpressibly kind action , that have rivet my affections to you , and oblige I , in this free and unreserved manner , to pour my whole soul into you bosom . I say , I have the less merit in this my return , because I be drive , by a irresistible impulse to it ; and could not help it , if I would . this , say he , ( and honoure I by kiss my hand , ) be engage , indeed ; if I may hope , that my 's gentle inclination for she persecutor be the strongest motive to she return ; and I so much value a voluntary love in the person I would wish for my wife , that I would have even prudence and interest hardly nam in comparison with it : and can you return I sincerely the honest compliment I now make you ?-- in the choice I have make , it be impossible I should have any view to my interest . love , true love , be the only motive by which I be induce . and be I not what I be , could you give I the preference to any other you know in the world , notwithstand what have pass between we ? why , say I , should you so much oblige refuse to answer this kind question ? as I have think you , and dangerous as you view to my honesty have be ; you , sir , be the only person live that ever be more than indifferent to I : and before I know this to be what I blush now to call it , I could not hate you , or wish you ill , though , from my soul , the attempt you make be shocking , and most distasteful to I . I be satisfied , my , say he ; nor shall I want to see those papers that you have kindly write for to you father ; though I still wish to see they too , for the sake of the sweet manner in which you relate what have pass , and to have before I the whole series of you suffering , that I may learn what degree of kindness may be sufficient to recompense you for they . in this manner , my dear father and mother , do you happy daughter find herself bless by she generous master ! a ample recompense for all she suffering do I think this sweet conversation only . a hundred tender thing he express besides , that though they never can escape my memory , yet would be too tedious to write down . oh , how I bless , and , I hope , ever shall , for all he gracious favour to he unworthy handmaid
handmaid ! what a happy change be this ! and who know but my kind , my generous master , may put it in my power , when he shall see I not quite unworthy of it , to be a means , without injure he , to dispense around I , to many person , the happy influence of the condition to which I shall be , by he kind favour , exalt ? Doubly blest shall I be , in particular , if I can return the hundredth part of the obligation I owe to such honest good parent , to whose pious instruction and example , under , I owe all my present happiness , and future prospect .-- of the joy that fill my mind on these proud hope ! on these delightful prospect !-- it be too mighty for I , and I must sit down to ponder all these thing , and to admire and bless the goodness of that Providence , which have , through so many intricate maze , make I tread the path of innocence , and so amply reward I for what it have itself enable I to do ! all glory to alone be ever give for it , by you poor enrapture daughter !---- I will now continue my most pleasing relation . as the chariot be return home from this sweet airing , he say , from all that have pass between we in this pleasing turn , my will see , and will believe , that the trial of she virtue be all over from I : but , perhaps , there will be some few yet to come of she patience and humility . for I have , at the earnest importunity of , and she daughter , promise they a sight of my beloved girl : and so I intend to have they whole family , and , and 's family , to dine with I once in a few day . and , since I believe you would hardly choose , at present , to grase the table on the occasion , till you can do it in you own right , I should be glad you would not refuse come down to we if I should desire it ; for I would preface we nuptial , say the dear gentleman ! of what a sweet word be that !-- with they good opinion of you merit : and to see you , and you sweet manner , will be enough for that purpose ; and so , by degree , prepare my neighbour for what be to follow : and they already have you character from I , and be disposed to admire you . , say I , after all that have pass , I should be unworthy , if I could not say , that I can have no will but yours : and however awkwardly I shall behave in such company , weigh down with a sense of you obligation on one side , and my own unworthiness , with they observation on the other , I will not scruple to obey you . I be oblige to you , , say he , and pray be only dress as you be ; for since they know you condition , and I have tell they the story of you present dress , and how you come by it , one of the young lady beg it as a favour , that they may see you just as you be : and I be the rather pleas it should be so , because they will perceive you owe nothing to dress , but make a much better figure with you own native stock of loveliness , than the greatest lady array in the most splendid attire , and adorn with the most glittering jewel . of sir , say I , you goodness behold you poor servant in a light greatly beyond she merit ! but it must not be expect , that other , lady especially , will look upon I with you favourable eye : but , nevertheless , I should be best pleased to wear always this humble garb , till you , for you own sake , shall order it otherwise : for , oh , sir , say I , I hope it will be always my pride to glory most in you goodness ! and it will be a pleasure to I to show every one , that , with respect to my happiness in this life , I be entirely the work of you bounty ; and to let the world see from what a lowly original you have raise I to honour , that the greatest lady would rejoice in . Admirable ! say he ; excellent girl ! -- surely thy sentiment be superior to those of all thy sex !-- I might have address a hundred fine lady ; but never , surly , could have have reason to admire one as I do you . as , my dear father and mother , I repeat these generous saying , only because they be the effect of my master 's goodness , be far from presum to think I deserve one of they ; so I hope you will not attribute it to my vanity ; for I do assure you , I think I ought rather to be more humble , as I be more oblige : for it must be always a sign of a poor condition , to receive obligation one can not repay ; as it be of a rich mind , when it can confer they without expect or need a return . it be , on one side , the state of the human creature , compare , on the other , to the Creator ; and so , with due deference , may he
he beneficence be say to be , and that be the highest that can be say . the chariot bring we home at near the hour of two ; and , bless be , my master be pure well , and cheerful ; and that make I hope he do not repent he of he late generous treatment of I . he hand I out of the chariot , and to the parlour , with the same goodness , that he shew when he put I into it , before several of the servants . come to inquire how he do . quite well , , say he ; quite well : I thank , and this good girl , for it !-- I be glad of it , say she ; but I hope you be not the worse for my care , and my doctoring of you !-- no , but the better , , say he ; you have much oblige I by both . then he say , , you and I have use this good girl very hardly .-- I be afraid , sir , say she , I should be the subject of she complaint .-- I assure you , say he , she have not open she lip about you . we have have a quite different subject to talk of ; and I hope she will forgive we both : you especially she must ; because you have do nothing but by my order . but I only mean , that the necessary consequence of those order have be very grievous to my : and now come we part to make she amend , if we can . , say she , I always say to ( as she call I ) , that you be very good , and very forgive . no , say he , I have be stark natch ; and it be she , I hope , will be very forgive . but all this preamble be to tell you , , that now I desire you will study to oblige she , as much as ( to obey I ) you be force to disoblige she before . and you will remember , that in every thing she be to be she own mistress . yes , say she , and mine too , I suppose , sy ? ay , say the generous gentleman , I believe it will be so in a little time .-- then , say she , I know how it will go with I ! and so put she handkerchief to she eye .-- , say my master , comfort poor . this be very generous , already to seem to put she in my power : and I take she by the hand , and say , I shall never take upon I , . , to make a bad use of any opportunity that may be put into my hand by my generous master ; nor shall I ever wish to do you any disservice , if I might : for I shall consider , that what you have do , be in obedience to a will which it will become I also to submit to and so , if the effect of we obedience may be different , yet as they proceed from one cause , that must be always reverence by I . see there , , say my master , we be both in generous hand ; and indeed , if do not pardon you , I should think she but half forgave I , because you act by my instruction .-- well , say she , bless you both together , since it must be so ; and I will double my diligence to oblige my lady , as I find she will soon be . of my dear father and mother ! now pray for I on another score ; for fear I should grow too proud , and be giddy and foolish with all these promise thing , so soothing to the vanity of my year and sex . but even to this hour can I pray , that would remove from I all these delightful prospect , if they be likely so to corrupt my mind , as to make I proud and vain , and not acknowledge , with thankful humility , the bless Providence which have so visibly conduct I through the dangerous path I have trod , to this happy moment . my master be pleased to say , that he think I might as well dine with he , since he be alone : but I beg he would excuse I , for fear , as I say , such excess of goodness and condescension , all at once , should turn my head ; -- and that he would , by slower degree , bring on my happiness , lest I should not know how to bear it . person that doubt themselves , say he , seldom do amiss : and if there be any fear of what you say , you could not have it in you thought : for none but the presumptuous , the conceited , and the thoughtless , err capitally . but , nevertheless , say he , I have such a opinion of you prudence , that I shall generally think what you do right , because it be you that do it . , say I , you kind expression shall not be throw away upon I , if I can help it ; for they will task I with the care of endeavouring to deserve you good opinion , and you approbation , as the best rule of my conduct . be then about to go up stair , permit I , sir , say I , ( look about I with some confusion , to see that
that nobody be there , ) thus on my knee to thank you , as I often want to do in the chariot , for all you goodness to I , which shall never , I hope , be cast away upon I . and so I have the boldness to kiss he hand . I wonder , since , how I come to be so forward . but what could I do ?-- my poor grateful heart be like a too full river , which overflow it be banks : and it carry away my fear and my shamefacedness , as that do all before it on the surface of its water ! he clasp I in he arm with transport , and condescendingly knee by I , and kiss I , say , of my dear oblige good girl , on my knee , as you on yours , I vow to you everlast truth and fidelity ! and may but bless we both with half the pleasur that seem to be before we , and we shall have no reason to envy the felicity of the greatest prince !-- of sy , say I , how shall I support so much goodness ! I be poor , indeed , in every thing , compare to you ! and how far , very far , do you , in every generous way , leave I behind you ! he raise I , and , as I bend towards the door , lead I to the stair foot , and , salut I there again , leave I to go up to my closet , where I throw myself on my knee in rapture of joy , and blesse that gracious , who have thus change my distress to happiness , and so abundantly reward I for all the suffering I have pass through . -- and oh , how light , how very light , do all those suffering now appear , which then my repin mind make so grievous to I !-- hence , in every state of life , and in all the change and chance of it , for the future , will I trust in , who know what be best for we , and frequently turn the very evils we must dread , to be the cause of we happiness , and of we deliverance from greater .-- my experience , young as I be , as to this great point of reliance on , be strong , though my judgment in general may be weak and uninform : but you will excuse these reflection , because they be you beloved daughter 's ; and , so far as they be not amiss , derive themselves from the benefit of yours and my late good lady 's example and instruction . I have write a vast deal in a little time ; and shall only say , to conclude this delightful , that in the afternoon my good master be so well , that he ride out on horseback , and come home about nine at night ; and then step up to I , and , see I with pen and ink before I in my closet , say , I come only to tell you I be very well , my Pamela : and since I have a letter or two to write , I will leave you to proceed in yours , as I suppose that be you employment , ( for I have put by my papers at he come up , ) and so he salute I , bid I good night , and go down ; and I finish up to this place before I go to bed . tell I , if it be more agreeable to I , she would he in another room ; but I say , no thank you , ; pray let I have you company . and she make I a fine courtesy , and thanke I .-- how time be alte ! . this mor my master come up to I , and talk with I on various subject , for a good while together , in the most kind manner . among other thing , he ask I , if I choose to order any new clothes against my marriage . ( o how my heart flutter when he mention this subject so freely ! ) I say , I leave every thing to he good pleasure , only repeat my request , for the reason aforegive , that I might not be too fine . he say , I think , my dear , it shall be very private : I hope you be not afraid of a sham - marriage ; and pray get the service by heart , that you may see nothing be omit . I glow between shame and delight . of how I feel my cheek burn ! I say , I fear nothing , I apprehend nothing , but my own unworthiness . say he , I think it shall be do within these fourteen day , from this day , at this house . of how I tremble ! but not with grief , you may believe -- what say my girl ? have you to object against any day of the next fourteen : because my affair require I to go to my other house , and I think not to stir from this till I be happy with you ? I have no will but yours , say I ( all glow like the fire , as I could feel :) but , sir , do you say in the house ? ay , say he ; for I care not how privately it be do ; and it must be very public if we go to church . it be a holy rite , sir , say I
I ; and would be better , methinks , in a holy place . I see ( say he , most kindly ) my lovely maid 's confusion ; and you trembl tenderness shew I ought to oblige you all I may . therefore I will order my own little chapel , which have not be use for two generation , for any thing but a lumber - room , because we family seldom reside here long together , to be clear and clean , and get ready for the ceremony , if you dislike you own chamber or mine . , say I , that will be better than the chamber , and I hope it will never be lumber again , but keep to the use for which , as I presume , it have be consecrate . o yes , say he , it have be consecrate , and that several ag ago , in my great great grandfather 's time , who build that and the good old house together . but now , my good girl , if I do not too much add to you sweet confusion , shall it be in the first seven day , or the second of this fortnight ? I look down , quite out of countenance . tell I , say he . in the second , if you please , sir , say I .-- as you please , say he most kindly ; but I should thank you , , if you would choose the first . I would rather , sir , if you please , say I , have the second . well , say he , be it so ; but do not defer it till the last day of the fourteen . pray sir , say I , since you embole I to talk on this important subject , may I not send my dear father and mother word of my happiness ?-- you may , say he ; but charge they to keep it secret , till you or I direct the contrary . and I tell you , I would see no more of you papers ; but I mean , I would not without you consent : but if you will show they to I ( and now I have no other motive for my curiosity , but the pleasure I take in reading what you write , ) I shall acknowledge it as a favour . if , sir , say I , you will be pleased to let I write over again one sheet , I will ; though I have rely upon you word , and not write they for you perusal . what be that ? say he : though I can not consent to it beforehand : for I more desire to see they , because they be you true sentiment at the time , and because they be not write for my perusal . , say I , what I be loath you should see , be very severe reflection on the letter I receive by the gipsy , when I apprehend you design of the sham - marriage ; though there be other thing I would not have you see ; but that be the worst . it can not be worse , say he , my dear sauce - box , than I have see already ; and I will allow you treat I in ever so black a manner , on that occasion , because it must have a very black appearance to you .-- well , sy , say I , I think I will obey you before night . but do not alter a word , say he . I will not , sir , reply I , since you order it . while we be talk , come up , and say be return . o , say my master , let he bring up the papers : for he hope , and so do I , that you have send they by he . but it be a great balk , when he come up and say , , do not care to deliver they ; and would have it , that he daughter be force to write that letter to he : and , indeed , sir , say he , the old gentleman take on sadly , and would have it that he daughter be undone , or else , he say , she would not have turn back , when on she way , ( as I tell he she do , say , ) instead of come to they . I begin to be afraid now that all would be bad for I again . well , , say he , do not mince the matter ; tell I , before , what they say . why , sir , both he and , after they have confer together upon you letter , madam , come out , weepe bitterly , that grieve my very heart ; and they say , now all be over with they poor daughter ; and either she have write that letter by compulsion , or have yield to you honour ; so they say ; and be , or would be ruin ! my master seem vex , as I fear . and I say , , sir , be so good as to excuse the fear of my honest parent . they can not know you goodness to I . and so ( say he , without answer I , ) they refuse to deliver the papers ? yes , and please you honour , say , though I tell they , that you , madam , of you own accord , on a letter I have bring you , very cheerfully write what I carry : but the old gentleman say , why , wife
wife , there be in these papers twenty thing nobody should see but ourselves , and especially not the ' squire . of the poor girl have have so many stratagem to struggle with ! and now , at last , she have meet with one that have be too hard for she . and can it be possible for we to account for she set out to come to we , and in such post haste , and , when she have get above half - way , to send we this letter , and to go back again of she own accord , as you say ; when we know that all she delight would have be to come to we and to escape from the peril she have be so long contende with ? and then , and please you honour , he say , he could not bear this ; for he daughter be ruin , to be sure , before now . and so , say , the good old couple sit themselves down , and , hand - in - hand , lean upon each other 's shoulder , do nothing but lament .-- I be piteously grieved , say he ; but all I could say could not comfort they ; nor would they give I the papers ; though I tell they I should deliver they only to herself . and so , and please you honour , I be force to come away without they . my good master see I all bath in tear at this description of you distress and fear for I ; and he say , I would not have you take on so . I be not angry with you father in the main ; he be a good man ; and I would have you write out of hand , and it shall be send by the post to , who live within two mile of you father , and I will enclose it in a cover of mine , in which I will desire , the moment it come to he hand , to convey it safely to you father or mother ; and say nothing of they send they papers , that it may not make they uneasy ; for I want not now to see they on any other score than that of mere curiosity ; and that will do at any time . and so say , he salute I before , and with he own handkerchief wip my eye ; and say to , the good old folk be not to be blame in the main . they do not know my honourable intention by they dear daughter ; who , , will , in a little time , be you mistress ; though I shall keep the matter private some day , and would not have it speak of by my servants out of my house . say , bless you honour ! you know best . and I say , o , sir , you be all goodness !-- how kind be this , to forgive the disappointment , instead of be angry , as I fear you would ! then withdraw . and my master say , I need not remind you of write out of hand , to make the good folk easy : and I will leave you to yourself for that purpose ; only send I down such of you papers , as you be willing I should see , with which I shall entertain myself for a hour or two . but , one thing , add he , I forget to tell you : the neighbour gentry I mention will be here tomorrow to dine with I , and I have order to prepare for they . and must I , sir , say I , be shew to they ? o yes , say he ; that be the chief reason of they come . and you will see nobody equal to yourself : do not be concerned . I open my papers , as soon as my master have leave I ; and lay out those begin on the morning he set out for , ' with the morning visit he make I before I be up , and the injunction of watchfulness , etc. to ; the next day 's gipsy affair , and my reflection , in which I call he truly diabolical , and be otherwise very severe , on the strong appearance the matter have then against he . he return on , with the dread he put I in , on the offering to search I for my papers which follow those he have get by 's means . my be force to give they up . he carriage to I after he have read they , and question to I . he great kindness to I on see the dangers I have escape and the trouble I have undergone . and how I unseasonably , in the midst of he goodness , express my desire of be send to you , have the intelligence of a sham - marriage , from the gipsy , in my thought . how this enrage he , and make he turn I that very out of he house , and send I on my way to you . the particular of my journey , and my grief at parte with he ; and my free acknowledgment to you , that I find , unknown to myself , I have begin to love he , and could not help it . he send after I , to beg my return ; but yet generously leave I at my liberty , when he might have force I to return whether I be willing or not . my resolution to oblige he , and fatigue journey back . my concern for he
he illness on my return . he kind reception of I , and shew I he sister Davers 's angry letter , against he behaviour to I , desire he to set I free , and threaten to renounce he as a brother , if he should degrade himself by marry I . my serious reflection on this letter , etc . ' ( all which , I hope , with the other , you will shortly see . ) and this carry matter down to night last . all that follow be so kind on he side , be we chariot conference , as above , on morning , and how good he have be ever since , that I think I would go no further ; for I be a little asham to be so very open on that tender and most grateful subject ; though he great goodness to I deserve all the acknowledgment I can possibly make . and when I have look these out , I carry they down myself into the parlour to he ; and say , put they into he hand , you allowances , good sir , as heretofore ; and if I have be too open and free in my reflection or declaration , let my fear on one side , and my sincerity on the other , be my excuse . you be very obliging , my good girl , say he . you have nothing to apprehend from my thought , any more than from my action . so I go up , and write the letter to you , briefly acquaint you with my present happiness , and my master 's goodness , and express the gratitude of heart , which I owe to the kindest gentleman in the world , and assure you , that I should soon have the pleasure of send back to you , not only those papers , but all that succeed they to this time , as I know you delight to amuse yourself in you leisure hour with my scribble : and I say , carry it down to my master , before I seal it , will you please , sir , to take the trouble of read what I write to my dear parent ? thank you , , say he , and set I on he knee , while he read it ; and see much pleased with it ; and give it I again , you be very happy , say he , my beloved girl , in you style and expression : and the affectionate thing you say of I be inexpressibly oblige ; and again , with this kiss , say he , do I confirm for truth all that you have promise for my intention in this letter .-- o what halcyon day be these ! God continue they !--a change would kill I quite . he go out in he chariot in the afternoon ; and in the evening return , and send I word , he would be glad of my company for a little walk in the garden ; and down I go that very moment . he come to meet I . so , say he , how do my dear girl do now ?-- whom do you think I have see since I have be out ?-- I do not know , sir , say I . why , say he , there be a turning in the road , about five mile off , that go round a meadow , that have a pleasant foot - way , by the side of a little brook , and a double row of lime on each side , where now and then the gentry in the neighbourhood walk , and angle , and divert themselves .-- I will show it you next opportunity .-- and I steep out of my chariot , to walk across this meadow , and bid meet I with it on the further part of it : and whom should I ' spy there , walk , with a book in he hand , read , but you humble servant ! do not blush , , say he . as he back be towards I , I think I would speak to the man : and , before he see I , I say , how do you , old acquaintance ? ( for , say he , you know we be of one college for a twelvemonth . ) I think the man would have jump into the brook , he give such a start at hear my voice , and see I . poor man ! say I . ay , say he , but not too much of you poor man , in that soft accent , neither , .-- say I , I be sorry my voice be so start to you , . what be you read ? , say he , and stammer with the surprise , it be the french Telemachus ; for I be about perfect myself , if I can , in the french tongue .-- think I , I have rather so , than perfect my in it .-- you do well , reply I .-- do not you think that yonder clould may give we a small shower ? and it do a little begin to wet .-- he say , he believe not much . if , say I , you be for the village , I will give you a cast ; for I shall call at 's in my return from the little round I be take . he ask I if it be not too great a favour ?-- no , say I , do not talk of that ; let we walk to the further open there , and we shall meet my chariot . so , , continue my
my master , we fall into conversation as we walk . he say he be very sorry he have incur my displeasure ; and the more , as he have be tell , by , who have it from 's family , that I have a more honourable view than at first be apprehend . I say , we fellow of fortune , , take sometimes a little more liberty with the world than we ought to do ; wanton , very probably , as you contemplative folk would say , in the sunbeam of a dangerous affluence ; and can not think of confin ourselves to the common path , though the safest and most eligible , after all . and you may believe I could not very well like to be supplant in a view that lay next my heart ; and that by a old acquaintance , whose good , before this affair , I be studious to promote . I would only say , sy , say he , that my first motive be entirely such as become my function : and , very politely , say my master , he add , and I be very sure , that however inexcusable I might seem in the progress of the matter , yourself , sir , would have be sorry to have it say , you have cast you thought on a person , that nobody could have wish for but yourself . well , , say I , I see you be a man of gallantry , as well as religion : but what I take most amiss be , that , if you think I do a wrong thing , you do not expostulate with I upon it , as you function might have allow you to do ; but immediately determine to counterplot I , and attempt to secure to yourself a prize you would have rob I of , and that from my own house . but the matter be at a end , and I retain not any malice upon it ; though you do not know but I might , at last , do honourably by she , as I actually intend . I be sorry for myself , sir , say he , that I should so unhappily incur you displeasure ; but I rejoice for she sake in you honourable intention : give I leave only to say , that if you make you lady , she will do credit to you choice with every body that see she , or come to know she ; and , for person and mind both , you may challenge the county . in this manner , say my master , do the parson and I confabulate ; and I set he down at he lodging in the village . but he keep you secret , ; and would not own , that you give any encouragement to he address . indeed , sir , say I , he could not say that I do ; and I hope you believe I . I do , I do , say he : but ' ti still my opinion , that if , when I see plot set up against my plot , I have not discover the parson as I do , the correspondence between you might have go to a length that would have put we present situation out of both we power . , say I , when you consider , that my utmost presumption could not make I hope for the honour you now seem to design I ; that I be so hardly use , and have no prospect before I but dishonou , you will allow that I should have see very little in earnest in my profession of honesty , if I have not endeavoure to get away : but yet I resolve not to think of marriage ; for I never see the man I could love , till you goodness embolden I to look up to you . I should , my dear , say he , make a very ill compliment to my vanity , if I do not believe you ; though , at the same time , justice call upon I to say , that it be , some thing consider , beyond my merit . there be a sweet , noble expression for you poor daughter , my dear father and mother !-- and from my master too ! I be glad to hear this account of the interview between and himself ; but I da not to say so . I hope in time he will be reinstate in he good graces . he be so good as to tell I , he have give order for the chapel to be clear . of how I look forward with inward joy , yet with fear and trembl ! . about twelve o'clock come , and he lady and two daughter ; and , and a sister - in - law of hers ; and , and he spouse and niece . , who be more and more obliging , be much concerned I be not dress in some of my best clothes , and make I many compliment . they all go into the garden for a walk , before dinner ; and , I understand , be so impatient to see I , that my master take they into the largest alcove , after they have walk two or three turn , and steep himself to I . come , my , say he , the lady can not be satisfied without see you , and I desire you will come . I say , I be asham ; but I would obey he . say he , the two young lady be dress out in they best attire ; but they make not such a appearance as
as my charme girl in this ordinary garb .-- , say I , sha not I follow you thither ? for I can not bear you should do I so much honour . well , say he , I will go before you . and he bid bring a bottle of sack , and some cake . so he go down to they . this alcove front the longest gravel - walk in the garden , so that they see I all the way I come , for a good way : and my master tell I afterwards , with pleasure , all they say of I . will you forgive the little vain slut , you daughter , if I tell you all , as he be pleased to tell I ? he say , ' spy I first , look , there , lady , come my pretty rustic !-- they all , I see , which dash I , stand at the window , and in the door - way , look full at I . my master tell I , that say , she be a charming creature , I see that , at this distance . and , it seem , who have be a sad rake in he younger day , swore he never see so easy a air , so fine a shape , and so graceful a presence .-- the say , I be a sweet girl . and say very handsome thing . even the parson say , I should be the pride of the county . o , dear sir ! all this be owe to the light my good master 's favour place I in , which make I shine out in they eye beyond my desert . he say the young lady blush , and envy I . when I come near , he see I in a little confusion , and be so kind as to meet I : give I you hand , say he , my poor girl ; you walk too fast , ( for , indeed , I want to be out of they gazing ) . I do so , with a courtesy , and he lead I up the step of the alcove , and , in a most gentleman - like manner , present I to the ladie , and they all salute I , and say , they hope to be better acquaint with I : and be pleased to say , I should be the flower of they neighbourhood . say , good neighbour , by you leave ; and salut I , add , now will I say , that I have kiss the loveliest maiden in . but , for all this , methotch I owed he a grudge for a tell - tale , though all have turn out so happily . very gravely follow he example , and say , like a bishop , bless you , fair excellence ! say , , dear madam , sit down by I : and they all sit down : but I say , I would stand , if they please . no , , say my master : pray sit down with these good lady , my neighbour :-- they will indulge it to you , for my sake , till they know you better ; and for you own , when they be acquaint with you . , say I , I shall be proud to deserve they indulgence . they all so gaze at I , that I could not look up ; for I think it be one of the distinction of person of condition , and well - breed people , to put bashful body out of countenance . well , , say my master , what say you now to my pretty rustic ?-- he swore a great oath , that he should better know what to say to I if he be as young as himself . say , you will never leave , . say my master , you be a little confused , my good girl , and out of breath ; but I have tell all my kind neighbour here a good deal of you story , and you excellence . yes , say , my dear neighbour , as I will call you ; we that be here present have all heard of you uncommon story . , say I , you have then hear what must make you kind allowance for I very necessary . no , say , we have hear what will always make you value as a honour to we sex , and as a worthy pattern for all the young lady in the county . you be very good , madam , say I , to make I able to look up , and to be thankful for the honour you be pleased to do I . come in with the canary , bring by , to the alcove , and some cake on a silver salver ; and I say , Jewkes , let I be you assistant ; I will serve the lady with the cake . and so I take the salver , and go round to the good company with it , end with my master . the say , she never be serve with such a grace , and it be give I too much trouble . o , madam , say I , I hope my good master 's favour will never make I forget , that it be my duty to wait upon he friend . master , sweet one ! say , I hope you will not always call ---- by that name , for fear it should become a fashion for all we lady to do the like through the county . I , sir , say I , shall have many reason
reason to continue this style , which can not affect you good lady . , say , you be very arch upon we but I see very well , that it will be the interest of all the gentleman , to bring they lady into a intimacy with one that can give they such a good example . I be sure then , madam , say I , it must be after I have be polish and improve by the honour of such a example as yours . they all be very good and affable ; and the young , who have wish to see I in this dress , say , I beg you pardon , dear miss , as she call I ; but I have hear how sweetly this garb become you , and be tell the history of it ; and I beg it , as a favour , that you might oblige we with you appearance in it . I be much oblige to you ladyship , say I , that you kind prescription be so agreeable to my choice . why , say she , be it you choice then ?-- I be glad of that : though I be sure you person must give , and not take , ornament from any dress . you be very kind , madam , say I : but there will be the less reason to fear I should forget the high obligation I should have to the kindest of gentleman , when I can delight to show the humble degree from which he goodness have raise I .-- my dear , say my master , if you proceed at this rate , I must insist upon you first seven day . you know what i mean . , say I , you be all goodness ! they drank a glass of sack each , and would make I do so too , say , it will be a reflection , madam , upon all the lady , if you do not do as they . no , , say I , that can not be , because the lady 's journey hither make a glass of canary a proper cordial for they : but I will not refuse ; because I will do myself the honour of drinking good health to you , and to all this worthy company . say good , to my master , I hope , sir , we shall have 's company at table . he say , very obligingly , , it be she time now ; and I will leave it to she choice . if the good lady , then , will forgive I , sir , say I , I have rather be excuse . they all say , I must not be excuse . I beg I might . you reason for it , my dear ? say my master : since the lady request it , I wish you would oblige they . , reply I , you goodness will make I , every day , worthier of the honour the lady do I ; and when I can persuade myself that I be more worthy of it than at present , I shall with great joy embrace all the opportunity they will be pleased to give I . whisper , as my master tell I afterwards ; do you ever see such excellence , such prudence , and discretion ? never in my life , say the other good lady . she will adorn , she be pleased to say , she distinction . ay , say , she would adorn any station in life . my good master be highly delighted , generous gentleman as he be ! with the favourable opinion of the lady ; and I take the more pleasure in it , because they favour seem to lessen the disgrace of he stooping so much beneath himself . say , we will not oppress you ; though we could almost blame you too punctilious exactness : but if we excuse Andrews from dinner , we must insist upon she company at the card - table , and at a dish of tea ; for we intend to pass the whole day with you , sir , as we tell you . what say you to that , , say my master . , reply I , whatever you and the lady please , I will cheerfully do . they say , I be very obliging . but rapt out a oath , and say , that they might dine together , if they would ; but he would dine with I , and nobody else : for , say he , I say , sir , as say , ( by which I find my master have tell they the story , ) you must not think you have choose one that nobody can like but yourself . the young lady say , if I please they would take a turn about the garden with I . I answer , I would very gladly attend they ; and so we three , and 's sister - in - law , and 's niece , walk together . they be very affable , kind , and oblige ; and we soon enter into a good deal of familiarity ; and I find a very agreeable person . she sister be a little more on the reserve ; and I afterwards hear , that , about a year before , she would fain have have my master make he address to she : but though be reckon rich , she be not think sufficient fortune for he . and now , to have he look down so low as I , must be a sort of mortification to a poor young lady ! -- and I pitie she .-- indeed I do !--
!-- I wish all young person of my sex could be as happy as I be like to be . my master tell I afterwards , that I leave the other lady , and and , full of my praise : so that they could hardly talk of any thing else ; one lanch out upon my complexion , another upon my eye , my hand , and , in short , for you will think I sadly proud , upon my whole person and behaviour ; and they all magnify my readiness and obligingness in my answer , and the like : and I be glad of it , as I say , for my good master 's sake , who seem quite pleased and rejoice . bless he for he goodness to I ! dinner not be ready , the young lady propose a tune upon the spinnet . I say , I believe it be not in tune . they say , they know it be but a few month ago . if it be , say I , I wish I have know it ; though indeed , lady , add I , since you know my story , I must own , that my mind have not be long in tune , to make use of it . so they would make I play upon it , and s to it ; which I do , a song my dear good lady make I learn , and use to be pleased with , and which she bring with she from Bath : and the lady be much take with the song , and be so kind as to approve my performance : and be pleased to compliment I , that I have all the accomplishment of my sex . I say , I have have a good lady , in my master 's mother , who have spare no pain nor cost to improve I . she say , she wish ---- could be prevail upon to give a ball on a approach happy occasion , that we might have a dancing - match , etc . -- but I can not say I do ; though I do not say so : for these occasion , I think , be too solemn for the principal , at least of we sex , to take part in , especially if they have the same thought of that solemnity that I have : for , indeed , though I have before I a prospect of happiness , that may be envy by lady of high rank , yet I must own to you , my dear parent , that I have something very awful upon my mind , when I think of the matter ; and shall , more and more , as it draw nearer and nearer . this be the song : I . , happy paper , gently steal , and underneath she pillow lie ; There , in soft dream , my love reveal , that love which I must still conceal , and , wrapt in awful silence , die . ii . should flame be doom have thy hapless fate , to atom thou wouldst quickly turn : my pain may bear a longer date ; for should I live , and should she hate , in endless torment I should burn . iii . tell fair AURELIA , she have charms , might in a hermit stir desire . T's attain the heav and that be in she arm , I would quit the world 's alluring harm , and to a cell content , retire . iv . of all that plea have my ravish would eye , she beauty should supply the place ; 's stroke , and 's dye , should but in vain presume to vie with she inimitable face . . no more I would wish for 's ray , to gild the object of my sight ; much less the taper 's fainter blaze : she eye should measure out my day ; and when she sleep , it should be night . about four o'clock . my master just come up to I , and say , if you should see below , do you think , , you should not be surprise ?-- no , sy , say I , I hope not . why wshould I ? expect , say he , a stranger then , when you come down to we in the parlour ; for the ladie be prepare themselves for the card - table , and they insist upon you company . -- you have a mind , sir , say I , I believe , to try all my courage . why , say he , do it want courage to see he ? no , sir , say I , not at all . but I be grievously dash to see all those strange lady and gentleman ; and now to see Williams before they , as some of they refuse he application for I , when I want to get away , it will a little shock I , to see they smile , in recollect what have pass of that kind . well , say he , guard you heart against surprise , though you shall see , when you come down , a man that I can allow you to love dearly ; though hardly preferably to I . this surprise I much . I be afraid he begin to be jealous of I . what will become of I , ( for he look very seriously , ) if any turn should happen now !-- my heart ach ! I know not what be the matter . but I will go down as brisk as I can , that nothing may be impute to I . yet I wish this have not
not be there now , when they be all there ; because of they fleer at he and I . otherwise I should be glad to see the poor gentleman ; for , indeed , I think he a good man , and he have suffer for my sake . so , I be send for down to card . I will go ; but wish I may continue they good opinion of I : for I shall be very awkward . my master , by he serious question , and bid I guard my heart against surprise , though I should see , when I come down , a man he can allow I to love dearly , though hardly better than himself , have quite alarme I , and make I sad !-- I hope he love I !-- but whether he do or not , I be in for it now , over head and ears , I doubt , and can not help love he ; ' ti a folly to deny it . but to be sure I can not love any man preferably to he . I shall soon know what he mean . now , my dear mother , must I write to you . well might my good master say so mysteriously as he do , about guard my heart against surprise . I never be so surprised in my life ; and never could see a man I love so dearly !-- of my dear mother , it be my dear , dear father , and not , that be below ready to receive and to bless you daughter ! and both my master and he enjoin I to write how the whole matter be , and what my thought be on this joyful occasion . I will take the matter from the beginning , that direct he foot to this house , to this time , as I have have it from , from my master , my father , the lady , and my own heart and conduct , as far as I know of both ; because they command it , and you will be pleased with my relation and so , as you know how I come by the connexion , will make one uniform relation of it . it seem , then , my dear father and you be so uneasy to know the truth of the story which have tell you , that fear I be betrayed , and quite undone , he get leave of absence , and set out the day after be there ; and so , on morning , he get to the neighbour town ; and there he hear , that the gentry in the neighbourhood be at my master 's , at a great entertainment . he put on a clean shirt and neckcloth ( which he bring in he pocket ) at a alehouse there , and get shaved ; and so , after he have eat some bread and cheese , and drank a can of ale , he set out for my master 's house , with a heavy heart , dread for I , and in much fear of be brow - beaten . he have , it seem , ask , at the alehouse , what family the ' squire have down here , in hope to hear something of I : and they say , a housekeeper , two maid , and , at present , two coachman , and two grooms , a footman , and a helper . be that all ? he say . they tell he , there be a young creature there , belike who be , or be to be , he mistress , or somewhat of that nature ; but have be he mother 's wait - maid . this , he say , grieve he heart , and confirm he fear . so he go on , and about three o'clock in the afternoon come to the gate ; and , ring there , 's coachman go to the iron gate ; and he ask for the housekeeper ; though , from what I have write , in he heart he could not abide she . she send for he in , little think who he be , and ask he , in the little hall , what he business with she be ?-- only , madam , say he , whether I can not speak one word with the ' squire ? no , friend , say she ; he be engage with several gentleman and lady . say he , I have business with he honour of greater consequence to I than either life or death ; and tear stood in he eye . at that she go into the great parlour , where my master be talk very pleasantly with the ladie ; and she say , , here be a good tight old man , that want to see you on business of life and death , he say , and be very earnest . ay , say he , who can that be ?-- let he stay in the little hall , and I will come to he presently . they all seem to stare ; and say , no more nor less , I dare say , my good friend , but a bastard - child . if it be , say , bring it in to we . I will , say he . tell I , my master be much surprised , when he see who it be ; and she much more , when my dear father say ,-- ! give I patience ! but , as great as you be , sir , I must ask for my child ! and burst out into tear . ( o what trouble have I give you both !
! ) my master say , take he by the hand , do not be uneasy , ; you daughter be in the way to be happy . this alarm my dear father , and he say , what ! then , be she die ? and tremble , he could scarce stand . my master make he sit down , and sit down by he , and say , no ; be praise ! she be very well : and pray be comfort ; I can not bear to see you thus apprehensive ; but she have write you a letter to assure you , that she have reason to be well satisfied , and happy . ah , sy I say he , you tell I once she be in , wait on a bishop 's lady , when all the time she be a severe prisoner here .-- well , that be all over now , , say my master : but the time be alte ; for now the sweet girl have take I prisoner ; and in a few day I shall put on the most agreeable fetter that ever man wore . o , sir ! say , he , you be too pleasant for my grief . my heart 's almost break . but may I not see my poor child ? you shall presently , say he ; for she be come down to we ; and since you will not believe I , I hope you will she . I will ask you , good sir , say he , but one question till then , that I may know how to look upon she when I see she . be she honest ? be she virtuous ?-- as the new - bear babe , , say my good master ; and in twelve day time , I hope , will be my wife . of flatter I not , gand you honour , say he : it can not be ! it can not be ! -- I fear you have delude she with strange hope ; and would make I believe impossibility !-- Jewkes , say he , do you tell my dear 's good father , when I go out , all you know concern I , and you mistress that be to be . meantime , make much of he , and set out what you have ; and make he drink a glass of what he like best . if this be wine , add he , fill I a bumper . she do so ; and he take my father by the hand , and say , believe I , good man , and be easy ; for I can not bear to see you torture in this cruel suspense : you dear daughter be the beloved of my soul . I be glad you be come : for you will see we all in the same story . and here be you dame 's health ; and bless you both , for be the happy means of procuring for I so great a blessing ! and so he drank a bumper to this most obliging health . what do I hear ? it can not surely be ! say my father . and you honour be too good , I hope , to mock a poor old man -- this ugly story , sir , of the bishop , run in my head -- but you say I shall see my dear child -- and I shall see she honest .-- if not , poor as I be , I would not own she . my master by not to let I know yet , that my father be come ; and go to the company , and say , I have be agreeably surprise : here be honest old Andrews come full of grief to see he daughter ; for he fear she be seduce ; and tell I , good honest man , that , poor as he be , he will not own she , if she be not virtuous . o , say they all , with one voice almost , dear sir ! shall we not see the good old man you have so praise for he plain good sense , and honest heart ? if , say he , I think would not be too much affect with the surprise , I would make you all witness to they first interview ; for never do daughter love a father , or a father a daughter , as they two do one another . , and all the lady , and the gentleman too , beg it might be so . but be not this very cruel , my dear mother ? for well might they think I should not support myself in such a agreeable surprise . he say , kindly , I have but one fear , that the dear girl may be too much affect . o , say , we will all help to keep up she spirit . say he , I will go up , and prepare she ; but will not tell she of it . so he come up to I , as I have say , and amuse I about , to half prepare I for some surprise ; though that could not have be any thing to this : and he leave I , as I say , in that suspense , at he mystical word , say , he would send to I , when they be go to card . my master go from I to my father , and ask if he have eat any thing . no , say ; the good man 's heart be so full , he can not eat , nor do any thing , till he have see he dear daughter
daughter . that shall soon be , say my master . I will have you come in with I ; for she be go to sit down with my guest , to a game at quadrille ; and I will send for she down . o , sir , say my father , do not , do not let I ; I be not fit to appear before you guest ; let I see my daughter by myself , I beseech you . say he , they all know you honest character , , and long to see you , for 's sake . so he take my father by the hand , and lead he in , against he will , to the company . they be all very good . my master kindly say , Lady and gentleman , I present to you one of the honestest man in , my good Pamela 's father . go to he , and take he by the hand , and say , we be all glad to see you , sir ; you be the happiest man in the world in a daughter ; whom we never see before to - day , but can not enough admire . say my master , this gentleman , , be the minister of the parish ; but be not young enough for . this airy expression , my poor father say , make he fear , for a moment , that all be a jest .-- also take he by the hand , and say , ay , you have a sweet daughter , honesty ; we be all in love with she . and the lady come , and say very fine thing : particularly , that he might think himself the happiest man in , in such a daughter . if , and please you , madam , say he , she be but virtuous , 'tis all in all : for all the rest be accident . but I doubt he honour have be too much upon the jest with I . no , say , we be all witness , that he intend very honourably by she .-- it be some comfort , say he , and wip he eye , that such good lady say so -- but I wish I could see she . they would have have he sit down by they ; but he would only sit behind the door , in the corner of the room , so that one could not soon see he as one come in ; because the door open against he , and hide he almost . the lady all sit down ; and my master say , Jewkes to step up , and tell the lady wait for she . so down I come . rise , and meet I at the door , and say , well , , we longe for you company . I do not see my dear father ; and it seem he heart be too full to speak ; and he get up , and sit down three or four time successively , unable to come to I , or to say any thing . the lady look that way : but I would not , suppose it be . and they make I sit down between and ; and ask I , what we should play at ? I say , at what you ladyship please . I wonder to see they smile , and look upon I , and to that corner of the room ; but I be afraid of look that way , for fear of see ; though my face be that way too , and the table before I . say my master , do you send you letter away to the posthouse , my good girl , for you father ? to be sure , sir , say I , I do not forget that : I take the liberty to desire to carry it . what , say he , I wonder , will the good old couple say to it ? of sir , say I , you goodness will be a cordial to they dear honest heart ! at that , my dear father , not able to contain himself , nor yet to stir from the place , gush out into a flood of tear , which he , good soul ! have be struggle with , it seem ; and cry out , of my dear child ! I know the voice , and , lift up my eye , and see my father , give a spring , overturn the table , without regard to the company , and throw myself at he foot : of my father ! my father ! say I , can it be ?-- be it you ? yes , it be ! it be !-- of bless you happy daughter ! I would have say , and down I sunk . my master seem concerned -- I fear , say he , that the surprise would be too much for she spirit ; and all the lady run to I , and make I drink a glass of water ; and I find myself encircle in the arm of my dearest father .-- o tell I , say I , every thing ! how long have you be here ? when do you come ? how do my honoure mother ? and half a dozen question more , before he could answer one . they permit I to retire with my father ; and then I pour forth all my vow and thanksgiving to for this additional blessing ; and confirm all my master 's goodness to he scarce - believe amazement . and we knee together , bless , and one another , for several ecstatic minute and my master come in
in soon after , my dear father say , of sir , what a change be this ! , reward and bless you , both in this world and the next ! may bless we all ! say he . but how do my sweet girl ? I have be in pain for you -- I be sorry I do not apprise you beforehand . of sir , say I , it be you ; and all you do must be good -- but this be a blessing so unexpected !---- well , say he , you have give pain to all the company . they will be glad to see you , when you can : for you have spoil all they diversion ; and yet painfully delighte they at the same time . , add he , do you make this house you own ; and the longer you stay , the more welcome you will be . after you have a little compose yourself , my dear girl , step in to we again . I be glad to see you so well already . and so he leave we . see you , my dear father , say I , what goodness there be in this once naughty master ! of pray for he ! and pray for I , that I may deserve it ! how long have this happy change be wrotch , my dear child , say I , several happy day !-- I have write down every thing ; and you will see , from the depth of misery , what have do for you happy daughter ! bless be he name ! say he . but do you say he will marry you ? can it be , that such a brave gentleman will make a lady of the child of such a poor man as I ? of the divine goodness ! how will you poor dear mother be able to support these happy tiding ? I will set out to - morrow , to acquaint she with they : for I be but half happy , till the dear good woman share they with I !-- to be sure , my dear child , we ought to go into some far country to hide ourselves , that we may not disgrace you by we poverty ! o , my dear father , say I , now you be unkind for the first time ! you poverty have be my glory , and my rich ; and I have nothing to brag of , but that I ever think it a honour , rather than a disgrace ; because you be always so honest , that you child might well boast of such a parentage ! in this manner , my dear mother , do we pass the happy moment , till come to I , and say , how do you do , dear madam ? I rejoice to see you so well ! pray let we have you company . and yours too , good Andrews , take he hand . this be very obliging , I tell she ; and we go to the great parlour ; and my master take my father by the hand , and make he sit down by he , and drink a glass of wine with he . mean -time , I make my excuse to the ladie , as well as I could , which they readily grant I . but , after he comical manner , put he hand on my shoulders : let I see , let I see , say he , where you wing grow ; for I never see any body fly like you .-- why , say he , you have break 's shins with the table . Shew she else , madam . he pleasantry make they laugh . and I say , I be very sorry for my extravagancy : and if it have not be my master 's doings , I should have say , it be a fault to permit I to be surprised , and put out of myself , before such good company . they say , all be very excusable ; and they be glad I suffer no more by it . they be so kind as to excuse I at card , and play by themselves ; and I go by my master 's command and sit on the other side , in the happiest place I ever be blest with , between two of the dearest man in the world to I , and each hold one of my hand :--my father , every now and then , with tear , lifte up he eye , and say , could I ever have hope this ! I ask he , if he have be so kind as to bring the papers with he ? he say , he have ; and look at I , as who should say , must I give they to you now ?-- I say , be pleased to let I have they . he pull they from he pocket ; and I stand up , and , with my best duty , give they into my master 's hand . he say , thank you , . you father shall take all with he , so see what a sad fellow I have be , as well as the present happier alteration . but I must have they all again , for the writer 's sake . the lady and gentleman would make I govern the tea - table , whatever I could do ; and attend I , to serve the company . my master and my father sit together , and drank a glass or two of wine instead of tea , and joke with my master , say , I warrant you would not be such a
a woman 's man , as to drink tea , for ever so much , with the ladie . but you time 's come , and I doubt not you will be make as comfortable as I . my master be very urgent with they to stay supper ; and at last they comply , on condition that I would grase the table , as they be pleased to call it . I beg to be excuse . my master say , do not be excuse , , since the lady desire it : and besides , say he , we will not part with you father ; and so you may as well stay with we . I be in hope my father and I might sup by ourselves , or only with Jewkes . and , who be a most obliging young lady , say , we will not part with you , indeed we will not . when supper be brotch in , take I by the hand , and say to my master , , by you leave ; and would have place I at the upper end of the table . pray , pray , madam , say I , excuse I ; I can not do it , indeed I cannot . , say my master , to the great delight of my good father , as I could see by he look , oblige , since she desire it . it be but a little before you time , you know . dear , good sir , say I , pray do not command it ! let I sit by my father , pray ! why , say , here be adue indeed ! sit down at the upper end , as you should do ; and you father shall sit by you , there . this put my dear father upon difficulty . and my master say , come , I will place you all : and so put at the upper end , at she right hand , and . on the other ; and he place I between the two young lady ; but very genteelly put below she younger sister ; say , , miss , I put you here , because you shall hedge in this little cuckow ; for I take notice , with pleasure , of you goodness to she ; and , beside , all you very young lady should sit together . this seem to please both sister ; for have the youngest miss be put there , it might have pique she , as matter have be formerly , to be place below I ; whereas give place to she youngest sister , make it less odd she should to I ; especially with that handsome turn of the dear man , as if I be a cuckow , and to be hedge in . my master kindly say , , , you and I will sit together . and so take he place at the bottom of the table , and set my father on he right hand ; and would sit on he left . for , say he , parson , I think the petticoat should sit together ; and so do you sit down by that lady ( he sister ) . a boiled turkey stand by I , my master say , cut up that turkey , , if it be not too strong work for you , that may not have too much trouble . so I carve it in a trice , and help the lady . say , I would give something to be so dexterous a carver . of madam , say I , my late good lady would always make I do these thing , when she entertaine she female friend , as she use to do on particular day . ay , say my master , I remember my poor mother would often say , if I , or any body at table , happen to be a little out in carving , I will send up for my , to show you how to carve . , have every accomplishment of she sex . she be quite wonderful for she year . say , and I can tell you , madam , that she play sweetly upon the spinnet , and sings as sweetly to it ; for she have a fine voice . Foolish ! say ; who , that hear she speak , know not that ? and who that see she finger , believe not that they be make to touch any key ? o , parson ! say he , ' tis well you be by , or I should have have a blush from the ladie . I hope not , , say ; for a gentleman of you politeness would not say any thing that would make lady blush .-- no , no , say he , for the world : but if I have , it would have be , as the poet say , ' they blush , because they understand . ' when the company go away , , , and , severally invite my master , and I with he , to they house ; and beg he would permit I , at least , to come before we leave those part . and they say , we hope , when the happy knot be tie , you will induce ---- to reside more among we . we be always glad , say , when he be here ; but now shall have double reason . of what grateful thing be these to the ears of my good father ! when the company be go , my master ask my father , if he smoke ? he answer , no . he make we both sit down by he , and say
say , I have be tell this sweet girl , that in fourteen day , and two of they be gone , she must fix on one to make I happy . and have leave it to she to choose either one of the first or last seven . my father hold up he hand , and eye ; bless you honour ! say he , be all I can say . now , , say my master , take my hand , do not let a little wrong - time bashfulness take place , without any other reason , because I should be glad to go to as soon as I could ; and I would not return till I carry my servants there a mistress , who should assist I to repair the mischief she have make in it . I could not look up for confusion . and my father say , my dear child , I need not , I be sure , prompt you obedience in whatever will most oblige so good a gentleman . what say my ? say my master : she do not use to be at a loss for expression . , say I , be I too sudden , it would look as if I doubt whether you would hold in you mind , and be not willing to give you time for reflection : but otherwise , to be sure I ought to resign myself implicitly to you will . say he , I want not time for reflection : for I have often tell you , and that long ago , I could not live without you : and my pride of condition make I both tempt and terrify you to other term ; but you virtue be proof against all temptation , and be not to be aw by terror : Wherefore , as I could not conquer my passion for you , I correcte myself , and resolve , since you would not be mine upon my term , you should upon you own : and now I desire you not on any other , I assure you : and I think the sooner it be do , the better . what say you , ? , say he , there be so much goodness on you side , and , bless be ! so much prudence on my daughter 's , that I must be quite silent . but when it be do , I and my poor wife shall have nothing to do , but to pray for you both , and to look back , with wonder and joy , on the way of Providence . this , say my master , be night ; and suppose , my girl , it be next , , , or morning ? --Say , my . will you , sir , say I , excuse I till to - morrow for a answer ? I will , say he ; and touch the bell , and call for . where , say he , do lie tonight ? you will take care of he . he be a very good man ; and will bring a blessing upon every house he set he foot in . my dear father wept for joy ; and I could not refrain keep he company . and my master , salut I , bid we good night , and retire . and I wait upon my dear father , and be so full of prattle , of my master 's goodness , and my future prospect , that I believe afterwards I be turn all into tongue : but he indulge I , and be transport with joy ; and go to bed , and dream of nothing but 's ladder , and angels ascend and descende , to bless he and he daughter . . I arise early in the morning ; but find my father be up before I , and be gone to walk in the garden . I go to he : and with what delight , with what thankfulness , do we go over every scene of it , that have before be so dreadful to I ! the fish - pond , the back - door , and every place . of what reason have we for thankfulness and gratitude ! about seven o'clock my good master join we , in he morning gown and slipper ; and look a little heavy , I say , , I fear you have not good rest last night . that be you fault , , say he . after I go from you , I must need look into you papers , and could not leave they till I have read they through ; and so ' twas three o'clock before I go to sleep . I wish , sy , say I , you have have better entertainment . the worst part of it , say he , be what I have bring upon myself ; and you have not spare I . , say I -- he interrupt I , say , well , I forgive you . you have too much reason for it . but I find , plainly enough , that if you have get away , you would soon have be 's wife : and I can not see how it could well have be otherwise . indeed , sir , say I , I have no notion of it , or of be any body 's . I believe so , say he ; but it must have come as a thing of course ; and I see you father be for it . , say he , I little think of the honour you goodness would confer upon she ; and I think that would be a match above what we could do for she , a great
great deal . but when I find she be not for it , I resolve not to urge she ; but leave all to she own prudence . I see , say he , all be sincere , honest , and open ; and I speak of it , if it have be do , as a thing that could hardly well be avoid ; and I be quite satisfied . but , say he , I must observe , as I have a hundred time , with admiration , what a prodigious memory , and easy and happy manner of narration , this excellent girl have ! and though she be full of she pretty trick and artifice , to escape the snare I have laid for she , yet all be innocent , lovely , and uniformly beautiful . you be exceedingly happy in a daughter ; and I hope I shall be so in a wife -- or , say my father , may she not have that honour ! I fear it not , say he ; and I hope I shall deserve it of she . but , , say my master , I be sorry to find in some part of you journal , that carry she order a little too far : and I the more take notice of it , because you have not complain to I of she behaviour , as she might have expect for some part of it ; though a good deal be occasion by my strict order . -- but she have the insolence to strike my girl , I find . , say I , I be a little provoking , I believe ; but as we forgave one another , I be the less entitled to complain off she . well , say he , you be very good ; but if you have any particular resentment , I will indulge it so far , as that she shall hereafter have nothing to do where you be . , say I , you be so kind , that I ought to forgive every body ; and when I see that my happiness be bring about by the very means that I think then my greatest grievance , I ought to bless those mean , and forgive all that be disagreeable to I at the same time , for the great good that hath issue from it .-- that , say he , and kiss I , be sweetly consider ! and it shall be my part to make you amend for what you have suffer , that you may still think lighter of the one , and have cause to rejoice in the other . my dear father 's heart be full ; and he say , with he hand fold , and lift up , , sir , let I go -- let I go -- to my dear wife , and tell she all these bless thing , while my heart hold ; for it be ready to burst with joy ! good man ! say my master -- I hope to hear this honest heart of yours speak at you lip . I enjoin you , , to continue you relation , as you have opportunity ; and though you father be here , write to you mother , that this wondrous story be perfect , and we , you friend , may read and admire you more and more . ay , pray , pray do , my child , say my father ; and this be the reason that I write on , my dear mother , when I think not to do it , because my father could tell you all that pass while he be here . my master take notice of my psalm , and be pleased to commend it ; and say , that I have very charitably turn the last verse , which , in the original , be full of heavy curse , to a wish that shew I be not of a implacable disposition through my then usage might have excuse it , if I have . but , say he , I think you shall s it to I to - morrow . after we have breakfaste , add he , if you have no objection , , we will take a airing together ; and it shall be in the coach , because we will have you father 's company . he would have excuse himself ; but my master would have it so : but he be much ashamed , because of the meanness of he appearance . my master would make we both breakfast with he on chocolate ; and he say , I would have you , , begin to dress as you use to do ; for now , at least , you may call you two other bundle you own ; and if you want any thing against the approaching occasion , private as I design it , I will send to Lincoln for it , by a special messenger . I say , my good lady 's bounty , and he own , have set I much above my degree , and I have very good thing of all sort ; and I do not desire any other , because I would not excite the censure of the ladie . that would be a different thing , he be pleased to say , when he publicly own he nuptial , after we come to the other house . but , at present , if I be satisfied , he would not make word with I . I hope , , say he , to my father , you will not leave we till you see the affair over , and then you will be sure I mean honourably : and , besides , will be induce
induce to set the day sooner . o , sir , say he , I bless I have no reason to doubt you meaning honourably : and I hope you will excuse I , if I set out on morning , very early , to my dear wife , and make she as happy as I be . why , , say my good master , may it not be perform on ? and then you father , maybe , will stay .-- I should have be glad to have have it to - morrow , add he ; but I have send for a license , that , you may have no scruple unanswered ; and he can not very well be back before to - morrow night , or morning . this be most agreeable news . I say , , I know my dear father will want to be at home : and as you be so good to give I a fortnight from last , I should be glad you would be pleased to indulge I still to some day in the second seven . well , say he , I will not be too urgent ; but the sooner you fix , the better . , we must leave something to these 's daughter , in these case , he be pleased to say : I suppose the little bashful folly , which , in the happiest circumstance , may give a kind of regret to quit the maiden state , and a awkwardness at the entrance into a new one , be a reason with ; and so she shall name she day . , say he , you be all goodness . I go up soon after , and new dress myself , take possession , in a happy moment , I hope , of my two bundle , as my good master be pleased to call they ; ( allud to my former division of those good thing my lady and himself bestow upon I ;) and so put on fine linen , silk shoe , and fine white cotton stocking , a fine quilted coat , a delicate green Mantea silk gown and coat , a french necklace , and a laced cambric handkerchief , and clean glove ; and , take my fan in my hand , I , like a little proud hussy , look in the glass , and think myself a gentlewoman once more ; but I forget not to return due thanks , for be able to put on this dress with so much comfort . would help to dress I , and compliment I highly , say , among other thing , that now I look like a lady indeed : and as , she say , the little chapel be ready , and divine service would be read in it to - morrow , she wish the happy knot might then be tie . say she , have you not see the chapel , madam , since it have be clean out ? no , say I ; but be we to have service in it to -morrow , do you say ?-- I be glad of that ; for I have be a sad heathen lately , sore against my will ! -- but who be to officiate ?-- somebody , reply she , will send . you tell I very good news , say I , : I hope it will never be a lumber - room again .-- ay , say she , I can tell you more good news ; for the two , and , be to be here at the opening of it ; and will stay and dine with you . my master , say I , have not tell I then . you must alter you style , madam , say she : it must not be master now , sure !-- o , return I , this be a language I shall never forget : he shall always be my master ; and I shall think myself more and more he servant . my poor father do not know I go up to dress myself ; and he say he heart misgave he when he see I first , for fear I be make a fool of , and that here be some fine lady that be to be my master 's true wife . and he stand in admiration , and say , o , my dear child , how well will you become you happy condition ! why you look like a lady already ! I hope , my dear father , say I , and boldly kiss he , I shall always be you dutiful daughter , whatever my condition be . my master send I word he be ready ; and when he see I , say , as you will , , you be a charme girl ! and so hand I to the coach , and would make my father and I sit both on the foreside , and sit backward , over against I ; and bid the coachman drive to the meadow ; that be , where he once meet . the conversation be most agreeable to I , and to my dear father , as we go ; and he more and more exceed in goodness and generosity ; and , while I be go up to dress , he have present my father with twenty guinea ; desire he to buy himself and my mother such apparel as they should think proper ; and lay it all out : but I know not this till after we come home ; my father have have no opportunity to tell I of it . he be pleased to inform I of the chapel be get in tolerable order ; and say , it look very well ; and
and against he come down next , it should be all new white - wash , and paint and line ; and a new pulpit - cloth , cushion , desk , etc. and that it should always be keep in order for the future . he tell I the two , and , would dine with he on : and , with they servants and mine , say he , we shall make a tolerable congregation . and , add he , have I not well contrive to show you that the chapel be really a little house of , and have be consecrate , before we solemnize we nuptial in it ?--o , sir , reply I , you goodness to I be inexpressible ! , say he , offer to come and officiate in it ; but would not stay to dine with I , because he have company at he own house : and so I intend that divine service shall be perform in it by one to whom I shall make some yearly allowance , as a sort of chaplain .-- you look serious , , add he : I know you think of you friend . indeed , sir , say I , if you will not be angry , I do . poor man ! I be sorry I have be the cause of he disoblige you . when we come to the meadow , where the gentry have they walk sometimes , the coach stopt , and my master alighted , and lead I to the brook - side , and it be a very pretty summer walk . he ask my father , if he choose to walk out , or go on in the coach to the farther end ? he , poor man , choose to go on in the coach , for fear , he say , any gentry should be walk there ; and he tell I , he be most of the way upon he knee in the coach , thank for he gracious mercy and goodness ; and begge a blessing upon my good master and I . I be quite astonished , when we come into the shady walk , to see there . see there , say my master , there be poor Williams , take he solitary walk again , with he book . and , it seem , it be so contrive ; for have be , as I since find , desire to tell he to be in that walk at such a hour in the morning . so , old acquaintance , say my master , again have I meet you in this place ? what book be you now read ? he say , it be 's . say my master , you see I have bring with I my little fugitive , that would have be : while you be perfect yourself in , I be try to learn ; and hope soon to be master of it . , , say he , be a very beautiful piece of french : but you have no equal . you be very polite , , say my master : and he that do not think as you do , deserve no share in she . why , , add he , very generously , why so strange , where you have once be so familiar ? I do assure you both , that I mean not , by this interview , to insult , or confound you . then I say , , I be very glad to see you well ; and though the generous favour of my good master have happily change the scene , since you and I last see one another , I be nevertheless very glad of a opportunity to acknowledge , with gratitude , you good intention , not so much to serve I , as I , but as a person -- that then have great reason to believe herself in distress . and I hope , sir , add I , to my master , you goodness will permit I to say this . you , , say he , may make what acknowledgment you please to 's good intention ; and I would have you speak as you think ; but I do not apprehend myself to be quite so much oblige to those intention . , say , I beg leave to say , I know well , that , by education , you be no libertine ; nor have I reason to think you so by inclination ; and , when you come to reflect , I hope you would not be displease with I . and this be no small motive to I , at first , to do as I do . ay , but , say my master , could you think I should have have reason to thank you , if , love one person above all she sex , you have rob I of she , and marry she yourself ? -- and then , say he , you be to consider , that she be a old acquaintance of mine , and a quite new one to you ; that I have send she down to my own house , for better secure she ; and that you , who have access to my house , could not effect you purpose , without be guilty , in some sort , of a breach of the law of hospitality and friendship . as to my designs upon she , I own they have not the best appearance ; but still I be not answerable to for those ; much less could you be excused to invade a property so very dear to I , and to endeaavor to gain a interest in she affections , when you could not be certain that matter
matter would not turn out as they have actually do . I own , say he , that some part of my conduct seem exceptionable , as you state it . but , sir , I be but a young man . I mean no harm . I have no interest , I be sure , to incur you displeasure ; and when you think of every thing , and the inimitable graces of person , and perfection of mind , that adorn this excellent lady , ( so he call I , ) you will , perhaps , find you generosity allow something as a extenuation of a fault , which you anger would not permit as a excuse . I have do , say my master ; nor do I meet you here to be angry with you . know not that she should see you : and now you be both present , I would ask you , , if , now you know my honourable design towards this good girl , you can really be almost , I will not say quite , as well pleas with the friendship of my wife , as you could be with the favour of ? , say he , I will answer you truly . I think I could have prefer , with she , any condition that could have befall I , have I consider only myself . but , sir , I be very far from have any encouragement to expect she favour ; and I have much more reason to believe , that , if she could have hope for you goodness , she heart would have be too much pre-engaged to think of any body else . and give I leave further to say , sir , that , though I tell you sincerely my thought , be I only to consider myself ; yet , when I consider she good , and she merit , I should be highly ungenerous , be it put to my choice , if I could not wish she in a condition so much superior to what I could raise she to , and so very answerable to she merit . , say my master , you be oblige to , and ought to thank he : he have distinguished well . but , as for I , who have like to have lose you by he means , I be glad the matter be not leave to he choice . , add he , I give you 's hand , because I know it will be pleasing to she , in token of she friendship and esteem for you ; and I give you mine , that I will not be you enemy : but yet I must say , that I think I owe this proper manner of you think more to you disappointment , than to the generosity you talk of . kiss my hand , as my master give it he ; and my master say , , you will go home and dine with I , and I will show you my little chapel ; and do you , , look upon yourself at liberty to number in the list of you friend . how generous , how noble , be this ! ( and so have I ) have tear of pleasure in he eye . I be silent : but say , , I shall be teach , by you generosity , to think myself inexcusably wrong , in every step I take , that could give you offence ; and my future life shall show my respectful gratitude . we walk on till we come to the coach , where be my dear father . , say my master , tell who that good man be . o , ! say I , it be my dear father ! and my master be pleased to say , one of the honestest man in : owe every thing that she be to be , as well as she be , to he ; for , I think , she would not have bring I to this , nor make so great resistance , but for the good lesson , and religious education , she have imbibe from he . say , take father 's hand , you see , good Andrews , with inexpressible pleasure , no doubt , the fruit of you pious care ; and now be in a way , with you beloved daughter , to reap the happy effect of it .-- I be overcome , say my dear father , with he honour 's goodness : but I can only say , I bless , and bless he . and I be nearer the coach than my master , and he offer to draw back , to give way to he , he kindly say , , , with you hand ; and step in yourself . he bow , and take my hand ; and my master make he step in , and sit next I , all that ever he could do ; and sit himself over against he , next my father , who sit against I . and he say , , I tell you yesterday that the divine you see be not ; I now tell you , this gentleman be : and though I have be tell he , I think not myself oblige to he intention ; yet I will own that and you be ; and though I will not promise to love he , I would have you . , say , you have a way of overcoming , that hardly all my reading affords a instance of ; and it be the more noble , as it be on this side , as I presume , the happy ceremony , which , great as you fortune be ,
, will lay you under a obligation to so much virtue and beauty , when the lady become yours ; for you will then have a treasure that prince might envy you . say my generous master , ( bless he ! ) , it be impossible that you and I should long live at variance , when we sentiment agree so well together , on subject the most material . I be quite confound ; and my master , see it , take my hand , and say , look up , my good girl ; and collect yourself . -- do not injure and I so much , as to think we be cap compliment , as we use to do verse at school . I dare answer for we both , that we say not a syllable we do not think . of sir , say I , how unequal be I to all this goodness ! every moment that pass add to the weight of the obligation you oppress I with . think not too much of that , say he most generously . 's compliment to you have great advantage of mine : for , though equally sincere , I have a great deal to say , and to do , to compensate the suffering I have make you undergo ; and , at last , must sit down dissatisfied , because those will never be balance by all I can do for you . he see my dear father quite unable to support these affect instance of he goodness ; -- and he let go my hand , and take he ; and say , see he tear , I wonder not , my dear 's father , that you honest heart spring thus to you eye , to see all she trial at a end . I will not pretend to say , that I have formerly either power or will to act thus : but since I begin to resolve on the change you see , I have reap so much pleasure in it , that my own interest will keep I steady : for , till within these few day , I know not what it be to be happy . poor , with tear of joy in he eyes , say , how happily , sir , have you be touch by the divine grace , before you have be hurrie into the commission of sins , that the deepest penitence could hardly have aton for ! -- have enable you to stop short of the evil ; and you have nothing to do , but to rejoice in the good , which now will be doubly so , because you can receive it without the least inward reproach . you do well , say he , to remind I , that I owe all this to the grace of . I bless for it ; and I thank this good man for he excellent lesson to he daughter ; I thank she for follow they : and i hope , from she good example , and you friendship , , in time , to be half as good as my tutoress : and that , say he , I believe you will own , will make I , without disparagement to any man , the best fox - hunter in .-- be go to speak : and he say , you put on so grave a look , , that , I believe , what I have say , with you practical good folk , be liable to exception : but I see we be become quite grave ; and we must not be too serious neither . what a happy creature , my dear mother , be you Pamela !-- of may my thankful heart , and the good use I may be enable to make of the blessing before I , be a means to continue this delightful prospect to a long date , for the sake of the dear good gentleman , who thus become the happy instrument , in the hand of , to bless all he smile upon ! to be sure , I shall never enough acknowledge the value he be pleased to express for my unworthiness , in that he have prevent my wish , and , unasked , seek the occasion of be reconcile to a good man , who , for my sake , have incur he displeasure ; and whose name he could not , a few day before , permit to pass through my lip ! but see the wonderful way of Providence ! the very thing that I most dread he see or know , the contents of my papers , have , as I hope , satisfy all he scruple , and be a means to promote my happiness . Henceforth let not we poor short - sight mortal pretend to rely on we own wisdom ; or vainly think , that we be absolutely to direct for ourselves . I have abundant reason , I be sure , to say , that , when I be most disappointed , I be nearer my happiness : for have i make my escape , which be so often my chief point in view , and what I have place my heart upon , I have escape the blessing now before I , and fall , perhaps headlong , into the misery I would have avoid . and yet , after all , it be necessary I should take the step I do , to bring on this wonderful turn : of the unsearchable wisdom of !-- and how much ought I to adore the divine goodness , and humble myself , who be make a poor instrument , as I hope , not only to magnify he graciousness to this fine gentleman and myself , but also to
to dispense benefit to other ! which of he mercy grant ! in the agreeable manner I have mention , do we pass the time in we second happy tour ; and I think would have sunk into the ground , when she see bring in the coach with we , and treat so kindly . we dine together in a most pleasant , easy , and frank manner ; and I find I need not , from my master 's generosity , to be under any restraint , as to my conduct to this good clergyman : for he , so often as he fancie I be reserve , move I to be free with he , and to he ; and several time call upon I to help my father and ; and seem to take great delight in see I carve , as , indeed , he do in every thing I do . after dinner we go and look into the chapel , which be a very pretty one , and very decent ; and , when finish as he design it , against he next come down , will be a very pretty place . my heart , my dear mother , when I first set my foot in it , throb a good deal , with awful joy , at the thought of the solemnity , which , I hope , will in a few day be perform here . and when I come up towards the little pretty altar - piece , while they be look at a communion - picture , and say it be prettily do , I gently steep into a corner , out of sight , and pour out my soul to on my knee , in supplication and thankfulness , that , after have be so long absent from divine service , the first time I enter into a house dedicated to he honour , should be with such bless prospects before I ; and begge of to continue I humble , and to make I not unworthy of he mercy ; and that he would be pleased to bless the next author of my happiness , my good master . I hear my master say , 's ? and so I break off sooner than I would , and go up to he . he say , , I hope I have not so offend you by my conduct past , ( for really it be what I ink to be asham of , ) as that you will refuse to officiate , and to give we you instruction here to - morrow . be so kind , for the first time , to offer it ; but I know it would be inconvenient for he ; and , beside , I be willing to make this request to you a introduction to we reconciliation . , say he , most willingly , and most gratefully , will I obey you : though , if you expect a discourse , I be wholly unprepared for the occasion . I would not have it , reply he , point to any particular occasion ; but if you have one upon the text -- there be more joy in over one sinner that repenteth , than over ninety - nine just person that need no repentance ; and if it make I not such a sad fellow as to be point at by mine and the lady 's servants we shall have here , I shall be well content . ' tTis a general subject , add he , make I speak of that ; but any one you please will do ; for you can not make a bad choice , I be sure . , say he , I have one upon that text ; but I be ready to think , that a thanksgive one , which i make on a great mercy to myself , if I may be permit to make my own acknowledgment of you favour the subject of a discourse , will be suitable to my grateful sentiment . it be on the text ;-- now lettest thout thy servant depart in peace ; for mine eye have see thy salvation . that text , say I , will be a very suitable one for I . not so , , say my master ; because I do not let you depart in peace ; but I hope you will stay here with content . of but , sir , say I , I have see 's salvation !-- I be sure , add I , if any body ever have reason , I have to say , with the bless virgin , my soul doth magnify the ; for he hath regard the low estate of he handmaiden -- and exalt one of low degree . say my good father , I be sure , if there be time for it , the book of would afford a fine subject for the honour do my dear child . why , good , say my master , should you say so ?-- I know that story , and will confirm what I say , that my good girl here will confer at least as much honour as she will receive . , say I , you be inexpressibly generous ; but I shall never think so . why , my , say he , that be another thing : it will be best for I to think you will ; and it will be kind in you to think you sha not ; and then we shall always have a excellent rule to regulate we conduct by to one another . be not this finely , nobly , wisely say , my dear mother ?--o what a bless thing it be to be match to a man of sense and generosity !-- how
how edify ! how !--But what shall I say am at loss for word . say , when we come out of the little chapel , he would go home , and look over he discourse , for one for the next day . my master say , I have one thing to say before you go -- when my jealousy , on account of this good girl , put I upon such a vindictive conduct to you , you know I take a bond for the money I have cause you to be trouble for : I really be asham of the matter ; because I never intend , when I present it to you , to have it again , you may be sure : but I know not what might happen between you and she , nor how far matter might have go between you ; and so I be willing to have that in awe over you . and I think it be no extraordinary present , therefore , to give you up you bond again cancel . and so he take it from he pocket , and give it he . I think , add he , all the charge attend it , and the trouble you have , be defray by my attorney ; I order that they should . they be , sir , say he ; and ten thousand thanks to you for this goodness , and the kind manner in which you do it . -- if you will go , , say he , shall my chariot carry you home ? no , sir , answer he , I thank you . my time will be so well employ all the way , in thinking of you favour , that I choose to meditate upon they , as I walk home . my dear father be a little uneasy about he habit , for appear at chapel next day , because of and the servants , for fear , poor man , he should disgrase my master ; and he tell I , when he be mention this , of my master 's kind present of twenty guinea for clothes , for you both ; which make my heart truly joyful . but oh ! to be sure , I can never deserve the hundredth part of he goodness !-- it be almost a hard thing to be under the weight of such deep obligation on one side , and such a sense of one 's own unworthiness on the other .--o ! what a power be that of do good !--i envy the rich and the great for nothing else . my master come to we just then , I say , oh ! sir , will you bounty know no limits ? my dear father have tell I what you have give he .-- a trifle , , say he , a little earnest only of my kindness . -- say no more of it . but do I not hear the good man express some sort of concern for somewhat ? hide nothing from I , . only , sir , say I , he know not how to absent himself from divine service , and yet be afraid of disgrac you by appear . , ! say he , I think you know that the outward appearance be nothing . I wish I have as good a habit inwardly as you have . but I will tell you , , you father be not so much thinner than I be , nor much shorter ; he and I will walk up together to my wardrobe ; though it be not so well store here , as in . and so , say he , pleasantly , do not you pretend to come near we , till I call for you ; for you must not yet see how man dress and undress themselves . of sir , say my father , I beg to be excuse . I be sorry you be tell . so be not I , say my master : pray come along with I . he carry he up stair , and shew he several suits , and would have have he take he choice . my poor father be quite confound : for my master see not any he think too good , and my father none that he think bad enough . and my good master , at last , ( he fix he eye upon a fine drab , which he think look the plainest , ) would help he to try the coat and waistcoat on himself ; and , indeed , one would not have think it , because my master be taller , and rather plumper , as I think but , as I see afterwards , they fit he very well . and be plain , and line with the same colour , and make for travel in a coach , please my poor father much . he give he the whole suit , and , call up , say , let these clothes be well aire against tomorrow morning . bring only with he he common apparel , not think to stay with we . and pray see for some of my stocking , and whether any of my shoe will fit he : and see also for some of my linen ; for we have put the good man quite out of he course , by keep he over . he be then please to give he the silver buckle out of he own shoe . so , my good mother , you must expect to see my dear father a great beau . , say my master , he want none ; for he own venerable white lock be better than all the peruke in . -- but I be sure I have
have hat enough somewhere . -- I will take care of every thing , sir , say . -- and my poor father , when he come to I , could not refrain tear . I know not how , say he , to comport myself under these great favour . of my child , it be all owe to the divine goodness , and you virtue . . this bless day all the family seem to take delight to equip themselves for the celebration of the in the little chapel ; and and come in she chariot , and the two in they own . and we breakfaste together in a most agreeable manner . my dear father appear quite spruce and neat , and be quite caress by the three lady . as we be at breakfast , my master tell , we must let the Psalms alone , he doubt , for want of a clerk : but say , no , nothing should be want that he could supply . my father say , if it might be permit he , he would , as well as he be able , perform that office ; for it be always what he have take delight in . and as I know he have learn psalmody formerly , in he youth , and have constantly practise it in private , at home , on evening , ( as well as endeavoured to teach it in the little school he so unsuccessfully set up , at the beginning of he misfortune , before he take to hard labour , ) I be in no pain for he undertake it in this little congregation . they seem much pleased with this ; and so we go to chapel , and make a pretty tolerable appearance ; , and all the servants , attend , but the cook : and I never see divine service perform with more solemnity , nor assist at with greater devotion and decency ; my master , , and the two miss , set a lovely example . my good father perform he part with great applause , make the response , as if he have be a practise parish - clerk ; and give the xxiiid psalm , [ the be only my support , and he that doth I feed : how can I then lack any thing Whereor I stand in need ? in pasture gre he feedeth I , where I do safely lie ; and after lead I to the stream , which run most pleasantly . and when I find myself near lose , then home he doth I take ; conduct I in he right path , for he own name 's sake . and tho ' I be e'en at death 's door , yet would I fear no ill : for both thy rod and shepherd 's crook I comfort still . thou hast my table richly spread in presence of my foe : thou hast my head with balm refresh ' , my cup doth overflow . and finally , while breath doth last , shall I defend : and in the house of will I my life for ever spend . ] which consist of but three stave , we have it all ; and he read the line , and begin the tune with a heart so entirely affect with the duty , that he go through it distinctly , calmly , and fervently at the same time ; so that whisper I , that good man be fit for all company , and present to every laudable occasion : and say , bless the dear good man !-- you must think how I rejoice in my mind . I know , my dear mother , you can say most of the shortest psalm by heart ; so I need not transcribe it , especially as you chief treasure be a bible ; and a worthy treasure it be . I know nobody make more or better use of it . give we a excellent discourse on liberality and generosity , and the blessing attend the right use of riche , from the xith chapter of Proverbs , verespect 24 , 25 . there be that scattereth , and yet increaseth ; and there be that withholdeth more than be meet , but it tendeth to poverty . the liberal soul shall be make fat : and he that watereth , shall be water also himself . and he treat the subject in so handsome a manner , that my master 's delicacy , who , at first , be afraid of some personal compliment , be not offend . judiciously keep to general ; and it be a elegant and sensible discourse , as my master say . my father be in the clerk 's place , just under the desk ; and , by she footman , whisper he to favour we with another psalm , when the sermon be end . he think , as he say afterwards , that the former be rather of the longest , choose the shortest in the book , which you know be the cxviith . [ of all ye nation of the world , praise ye the always : and all ye people every where set forth he noble praise . for great he kindness be to we ; he truth doth not decay : Wherefore praise ye the we ; praise ye the alway . ] my master thank for he excellent discourse , and so do the lady ; as also do I most heartily : and he be pleased to take my dear father by the hand , as do also , and thanke he . the lady , likewise , make he they compliment ; and the servants all look upon he with countenance of respect and pleasure . at dinner
dinner , do what I could , I be force to take the upper end of the table ; and my master sit at the lower end , between and my father . and he say , , you be so dexterous , that I think you may help the lady yourself ; and I will help my two good friend . I should have tell you , though , that I dress myself in a flower satin , that be my lady 's , and look quite fresh and good , and which be give I , at first , by my master ; and the lady , who have not see I out of my homespun before , make I abundance of fine compliment , as soon as they see I first . talk of the just after dinner , my master be very naughty , if I may so say : for he say to my father , , I think in the afternoon , as we shall have only prayer , we may have one longer psalm ; and what think you of the cxxxviith ? of , good sir ! say I , pray , pray , not a word more ! say what you will , , say he , you shall s it to we , accord to you on version , before these good lady go away . my father smile , but be half concerned for I ; and say , will it bear , and please you honour ?--o ay , say he , never fear it ; so long as be not in the hearing . this excite all the lady ' curiosity ; and say , she would be loath to desire to hear any thing that would give I concern ; but should be glad I would give leave for it . indeed , madam , say I , I must beg you will not insist upon it . I can not bear it .-- you shall see it , indeed , lady , say my master ; and pray , , not always as you please , neither .-- then , pray sy , say I , not in my hearing , I hope , , return he , you would not write what be not fit to be hear !-- but , sir , say I , there be particular case , time , and occasion , that may make a thing passable at one time , that would not be tolerable at another . o , say he , let I judge of that , as well as you , . these lady know a good part of you story ; and , let I tell you , what they know be more to you credit than mine ; so that if I have no averseness to revive the occasion , you may very well bear it . say he , I will put you out of you pain , : here it be : and take it out of he pocket . I stand up , and say , indeed , sir , I can not bear it ; I hope you will allow I to leave the room a minute , if you will read it . indeed but I will not , answer he . say , , good sir , do not let we hear it , if Andrews be so unwilling . well , , say my master , I will put it to you choice , whether I shall read it now , or you will s it by and by . that be very hard , sir , say I . it must be one , I assure you , say he . why then , sir , reply I , you must do as you please ; for I can not s it . well , then , say my master , I find I must read it ; and yet , add he , after all , I have as well let it alone , for it be no great reputation to myself . of then , say , pray let we hear it , to choose . why then , proceed he , the case be this : , I find , when she be in the time of she confinement , ( that be , add he , when she be take prisoner , in order to make I one ; for that be the upshot of the matter , ) in the journal she keep , which be intend for nobody 's perusal but she parent , tell they , that she be importune , one , by , to s a psalm ; but she spirit not permit , she decline it : but after be go down , she say , she recollect , that the cxxxviith psalm be applicable to she own case ; have often , on other day , in vain , besotch she to s a song : that thereupon she turn it more to she own suppose case ; and believe have a design against she honour , and look upon she as she gaoler , she thus give she version of this psalm . but pray , , do you read one verse of the common translation , and I will read one of 's . then , pull out he little pocket - - , read the first two stanza : I . when we do sit in , the rivers round about ; then in remembrance of , the tear for grief burst out . ii . we hang would we harps and instrument the willow tree upon : for in that place , men , for that use , have plan many a one . my master then read : I . when sad I sit in ---- and - hall ,
, all guard round about , and think of ev'ry absent friend , the tear for grief burst out . ii . my joy and hope all overthrown , my heart - string almost break , Unfin my mind for melody , much more to bear a joke . the lady say , it be very pretty ; and , that somebody else have more need to be concerned than the versifier . I know , say my master , I should get no credit by shew this . but let we read on , . so read : iii . then they , to whom we pris'ner be , say to we , tauntingly , now let we hear you Hebrew song , and pleasant melody . now this , say my master , be very near ; and read : iii . then she , to whom I prisoner be , say to I tauntingly , now cheer you heart , and s a song , and tune you mind to joy . Mighty sweet , say . but let we see how the next verse be turn . it be this : iv . ! say we ; who can once frame he heavy heart to se the praise of we living , thus under a strange king ? why , say my master , it be turn with beautiful simplicity , thus : iv . ! say I , how can I frame my heavy heart to se , or tune my mind , while thus enthrall would by such a wicked thing ? very pretty , say . say , o , dear madam ! could you wish that we should be deprive of this new instance of you genius and accomplishment ? o ! say my dear father , you will make my good child proud . no , say my master very generously , can not be proud . for no one be proud to hear themselves praise , but those who be not use to it .-- but proceed , . he read : . but yet , if I out of my heart let slide ; then let my finger quite forget the warbling harp to guide . well , now , say my master , for 's version : . but yet , if from my innocence I ev'n in thought should slide , then let my finger quite forget the sweet spinnet to guide . read : . and let my tongue , within my mouth , be ty' for ever fast , if I rejoice , before I see thy full deliv'rance past . this , also , say my master , be very near : . and let my tongue , within my mouth , be lock would for ever fast , if I rejoice , before I see my full deliv'rance past . now , good sir , say I , oblige I ; do not read any further : pray do not ! of pray , madam , say , let I beg to have the rest read ; for I long to know whom you make the of , and how you turn the Psalmist 's execration against the insulting . well , , reply I , you should not have say so . o , say my master , that be one of the best thing of all . poor stand for 's sons ; and we must not lose this , because I think it one of my 's excellency , that , though thus oppress , she pray for no harm upon the oppressor . , , the next stanza . so he read : . therefore , of ! remember now the curse noise and cry , that 's son against we make , when they ra would we city . . remember , , they cruel word , when , with a mighty sound , they cry , , yea down with it , unto the very ground ! well , say my master , here seem , in what I be go to read , a little bit of a curse indeed , but I think it make no ill figure in the comparison . Vii . and thou , ! recompense the evil I endure from those who seek my sad disgrace , so causeless , to procure . and now , say he , for 's . though a little severe in the imputation . . remember , , this , when with a mighty sound , she cry , down with she chastity , down to the very ground ! sure , sir , say I , this might have be spare ! but the lady and say , no , by no means ! and I see the poor wicked woman have no favourer among they . now , say my master , read the Psalmist 's heavy curse : and read : . Ev'n so shalt thou , of ! at length to dust be bring : and happy shall that man be call ' , that we revenge hath wrotch . . yea , bless shall the man be call have that take thy little one , and dasheth they in piece small against the very stone . thus he say , very kindly , have my turn these line : . Ev'n so shal thou , o wick one ! at length to shame be bring ; and happy shall all those be call ' , that my deliv'rance wrotch . . yea , bless shall the man be call have that shame thee of thy evil , and save I from thy vile attempt , and thee , too , from the --- l . I fancy this bless man , say my master smile , be , at that time , hope to be you , , if the truth
truth be know . , say he , whoever it be intend for then , it can be nobody but you good self now . I could hardly hold up my head for the praise the kind lady be pleased to heap upon I . I be sure , by this , they be very partial in my favour ; all because my master be so good to I , and love to hear I praise ; for I see no such excellence in these line , as they would make I believe , besides what be borrowed from the Psalmist . we all , as before , and the cake -maid too , attend the prayer of the church in the afternoon ; and my dear father conclude with the follow stanza of the cxlvth psalm ; suitably magnify the holy name of for all mercy ; but do not observe , altogether , the method in which they stand ; which be the less necessary , he think , as he give out the line . the be just in all he way : he work be holy all : and he be near all those that do in truth upon he call . he the desire of all they that fear he , will fulfil ; and he will hear they when they cry , and save they all he will . the eyes of all do wait on thee ; thou dost they all relieve : and thou to each sufficient food , in season due , dost give . thou openest thy plenteous hand , and bounteously dost fill all thing whatever , that do live , with gift of thy good will . my thankful mouth shall gladly speak the praise of the : all flesh , to praise he holy name , for ever shall accord . we walk in the garden till tea be ready ; and as he go by the back - door , my master say to I , of all the flower in the garden , the sun - flower be the fairest !-- o , sy , say I , let that be now forget ! hear he say so , and see a little out of countenance : Whereupon my master say , I mean not to make you serious , ; but we see how strangely thing be bring about . I see other scene hereabout , that , in my 's dangers , give I more cause of concern , than any thing you ever do should give you . , say he , you be very generous . my master and afterwards walk together for a quarter of a hour ; and talk about general thing , and some scholastic subject ; and join we , very well pleased with one another 's conversation . say , put herself on one side of I , as my master be on the other , but pray , sir , when be the happy time to be ? we want it over , that we may have you with we as long afterwards as you can . say my master , I would have it to - morrow , or next day at farthest , if will : for I have send for a license , and the messenger will be here to - night , or early in the morning , I hope . but , add he , pray , , do not take beyond . she be pleased to say , sure it will not be delay by you , madam , more than need !-- well , say he , now you be on my side , I will leave you with she to settle it : and , I hope , she will not let little bashful nicety be important with she ; and so he join the two miss . tell I , I be to blame , she would take upon she to say , if I delay it a moment ; because she understand be very uneasy at the prospect , that it would be so ; and if any thing should happen , it would be a sad thing !-- madam , say I , when he be pleased to mention it to I first , he say it should be in fourteen day ; and afterwards , ask I if I would have it in the first or the second seven ? I answer -- for how could I do otherwise ?-- in the second . he desire it might not be the last day of the second seven . now , madam , say I , as he be then pleased to speak he mind , no doubt , I would not , for any thing , seem too forward . well , but , say she , as he now urge you in so genteel and gentlemanly a manner for a shorter day , I think , if I be in you place , I would agree to it . she see I hesitate and blush , and say , well , you know best ; but I say only what I would do . I say , I would consider of it ; and if I see he be very earnest , to be sure I should think I ought to oblige he . be beg to be at the wedding , and to have a ball : and they say , , , second we request , and we shall be greatly oblige to you . indeed , lady , say I , I can not promise that , if I might .-- why so ? say they .-- because , answer I -- I know not what ! but I think one may , with pleasure , celebrate a anniversary of one 's nuptial ; but the day itself -- indeed
indeed , lady , I think it be too solemn a business , for the party of we sex to be very gay upon : it be a quite serious and awful affair : and I be sure , in you own case , you would be of my mind . why , then , say , the more need one have to be as light - hearted and merry as one can . I tell you , say my master , what sort of a answer you would have from . the younger miss say , she never hear of such grave folk in she life , on such a occasion : why , sir , say she , I hope you will se psalm all day , and miss will fast and pray ! such sackcloth and ash doing , for a wedding , do I never hear of !-- she speak a little spitefully , I think ; and I return no answer . I shall have enough to do , I reckon , in a while , if I be to answer every one that will envy I ! we go in to tea ; and all that the lady could prevail upon my master for , be a dancing match before he leave this county : but say , it should then be at they house ; for , truly , if she might not be at the wedding , she would be affront , and come no more hither , till we have be there . when they be go , my master would have have my father stay till the affair be over ; but he beg he might set out as soon as it be light in the morning ; for , he say , my mother would be doubly uneasy at he stay ; and he burn with impatience to let she know all the happy thing that have befall she daughter . when my master find he so desirous to go , he call , and order he to get a particular bay horse ready betime in the morning , for my father , and a portmanteau , to put he thing in ; and to attend he a day 's journey : and if , say he , choose it , see he safe to he own home : and , add he , since that horse will serve you , , to ride backwards and forwards , to see we , when we go into , I make you a present of it , with the accoutrement . and , see my father go to speak , he add , I will not be say nay . of how good be this ! he also say a great many kind thing at supper - time , and give he all the papers he have of mine ; but desire , when he and my mother have read they , that he would return they to he again . and then he say , so affectionate a father and daughter may , perhaps , be glad to be alone together ; therefore remember I to you good wife , and tell she , it will not be long , I hope , before I see you together ; on a visit to you daughter , at my other house : and so I wish you good night , and a good journey , if you go before I see you . and then he shook hand , and leave my dear father almost unable to speak , through the sense of he favour and goodness . you may believe , my dear mother , how loath I be to part with my good father ; and he be also unwilling to part with I ; but he be so impatient to see you , and tell you the bless tiding , with which he heart overflow , that I could hardly wish to detain he . bring two bottle of cherry - brandy , and two of cinnamon - water , and some cake ; and they be put up in the portmanteau , with my father 's newly present clothes ; for he say , he would not , for any thing , be see in they in he neighbourhood , till I be actually know , by every body , to be marry ; nor would he lay out any part of the twenty guinea till then neither , for fear of reflection ; and then he would consult I as to what he would buy . well , say I , as you please , my dear father ; and I hope now we shall often have the pleasure of hearing from one another , without need any art or contrivance . he say , he would go to bed betime , that he might be up as soon as it be light ; and so he take leave of I , and say , he would not love I , if I get up in the morning to see he go ; which would but make we both loath to part , and grieve we both all day . bring he a pair of boot , and tell he , he would call he up at peep of day , and put up every thing over night ; and so I receive he blessing , and he prayer , and he kind promise of procure the same from you , my dear mother ; and go up to my closet with a heavy heart , and yet a half - pleased one , if I may so say ; for that , as he must go , he be go to the best of wife , and with the best of tiding . but I beg he would not work so hard as he have do
do ; for I be sure my master would not have give he twenty guinea for clothes , if he have not design to do something else for he ; and that he should be the less concerned at receive benefit , from my good master , because he , who have so many person to employ in he large possession , could make he serviceable , to a degree equivalent , without hurt any body else . he promise I fair ; and , pray , dear mother , see he perform . I hope my master will not see this : for I will not send it you , at present , till I can send you the best of news ; and the rather , as my dear father can supply the greatest part of what I have write , since the papers he carry you , by he own observation . so good night , my dear mother : and send my father a safe journey , and a happy meeting to you both ! . be return , my master come up to I to my closet , and bring I the license . of how my heart flutter at the sight of it ! now , , say he , tell I , if you can oblige I with the day . you word be all that be want . I make bold to kiss he dear hand ; and , though unable to look up , say -- I know not what to say , sir , to all you goodness : I would not , for any consideration , that you should believe I capable of receive negligently a honour , that all the duty of a long life , be it to be lent I , will not be sufficient to enable I to be grateful for . I ought to resign myself , in every thing I may or can , implicitly to you will . but --but what ? say he , with a kind impatience .-- why , sy , say I , when from last you mention four day , I have reason to think that term you choice ; and my heart be so wholly yours , that I be afraid of nothing , but that I may be forwarder than you wish . impossible , my dear creature ! say he , and fold I in he arm : impossible ! if this be all , it shall be set about this moment , and this happy day shall make you mine !-- I will send away instantly , say the dear gentleman ; and be go . I say , no , pray , sir , pray , sir , hear I !--Indeed it can not be to - day !-- ! say he .-- no , indeed , sir ! say I -- and be ready to sink to see he generous impatience . why flatter you then my fond heart , reply he , with the hope that it might ? , say I , I will tell you what I have think , if you will vouchsafe I you attention . do then , say he . I have , sir , proceed I , a great desire , that , whenever the day be , it may be on a : on a my dear father and mother be marry ; and , though poor , they be a very happy pair .-- on a you poor be bear . on a my dear good lady take I from my parent into she protection . on a , sir , you cause I to be carry away to this place , to which I now , by 's goodness , and you favour , owe so amazingly all my present prospect ; and on a it be , you name to I , that fourteen day from that you would confirm my happiness . now , sir , if you please to indulge my superstitious folly , you will greatly oblige I . I be sorry , sir , for this reason , when you bid I not defer till the last day of the fourteen , that in next week be that last day . this , , be a little superstitious , I must need say ; and I think you should begin now to make another day in the week a happy one ; as for example ; on a , may you say , my father and mother conclude to be marry on the follow . on a , so many year ago , my mother be prepare all she matter to be bring to be on the follow . on a , several week ago , it be that you have but two day more to stay , till you be carry away on . on a , I myself , say he , well remember , it be that I write you the letter , that prevail on you so kindly to return to I ; and on the same day you do return to my house here ; which I hope , my girl , will be as propitious a era as any you have name : and now , lastly , will you say , which will cry the work ; and , on a I be marry .-- come , come , my dear , add he , have reign long enough o' conscience ; let we now set in its place , or at least on a equality with it , since you see it have a very good title , and as we now stand in the week before we , claim priority : and then , I hope , we shall make , , , , and , as happy day as and ; and so , by 's
's blessing , move round , as the day move , in a delightful circle , till we be at a loss what day to prefer to the rest . of how charmingly be this say !-- and how sweetly kind ! indeed , sir , say I , you rally my folly very agreeably ; but do not let a little matter stand in the way , when you be so generously oblige in a greater : indeed I like best , if I may choose . well , then , say he , if you can say you have a better reason than this , I will oblige you ; else I will send away for the parson this moment . and so , I protest , he be go ! -- dear sir , how I tremble ! stay , stay , sy , say I : we have a great deal to say first ; I have a deal of silly prate to trouble you with !-- well , say then , in a minute , reply he , the most material : for all we have to say may be talk of while the parson be come .-- o , but indeed , and indeed , say I , it can not be to - day !-- well , then , shall it be to - morrow ? say he .-- why , sir , if it must not be on a , you have give so many pleasant distinction for a , that let it then be next .-- what ! a week still ? say he . , answer I , if you please ; for that will be , as you enjoin , within the second seven day . why , girl , say he , ot will be seven month till next . let it , say he , if not to - morrow , be on ; I protest I will stay no longer . then , sir , return I , please to defer it , however , for one day more , and it will be my beloved ! if I consent to defer it till then , may I hope , my , say he , that next shall certainly be the happy day ? --yes , sir , say I and I be sure I look very foolishly ! and yet , my dear father and mother , why should I , with such a fine gentleman ? and whom I so dearly love ? and so much to my honour too ? but there be something greatly awful upon my mind , in the solemn circumstance , and a change of condition never to be recal , though all the prospect be so desirable . and I can but wonder at the thoughtless precipitancy with which most young folk run into this important change of life ! so now , my dear parent , have I be bring to fix so near a day as next ; and this be . of dear , it make one out of breath almost to think of it ! this , though , be a great cut off ; a whole week out of ten day . I hope I be not too forward ! I be sure , if it oblige my dear master , I be justifi ; for he deserve of I all thing in my poor power . after this , he ride out on horseback , attend by , and do not return till night . how by degrees thing steal upon one ! I think even this small absence tedious ; and the more , as we expect he home to dinner .-- I wish I may not be too fond , and make he indifferent : but yet , my dear father and mother , you be always fond of one another , and never indifferent , let the world run as it would . when he return , he say , he have have a pleasant ride , and be lead out to a greater distance than he intend . at supper he tell I , that he have a great mind should marry we ; because , he say , it would show a thorough reconciliation on he part . but , say he , most generously , I be apprehensive , from what pass between you , that the poor man will take it hardly , and as a sort of insult , which I be not capable of . what say my girl ?-- do you think he would ? I hope not , sir , say I : as to what he may think , I can not answer ; but as to any reason for he thought , I can : for indeed , sir , say I , you have be already so generous , that he can not , I think , mistake you goodness . he then speak with some resentment of 's behaviour , and I ask , if any thing new have occur ? yes , say he ; I have have a letter deliver I from she impertinent husband , professedly at she instigation , that amount to little less than a piece of insolent bravery , on suppose I be about to marry you . I be so provoke , add he , that after I have read it , I tore it in a hundred piece , and scatter they in the air , and bid the man who bring it let he master know what i have do with he letter ; and so would not permit he to speak to I , as he would fain have do , -- I think the fellow talk somewhat of he lady come hither ; but she shall not set she foot within my door ; and I suppose
suppose this treatment will hinder she . I be much concerned at this : and he say , have I a hundred sister , , they opposition should have no weight with I : and I do not intend you should know it ; but you can not but expect a little difficulty from the pride of my sister , who have suffer so much from that of she brother ; and we be too nearly ally in mind , as well as blood , I find . -- but this be not she business : and if she would have make it so , she should have do it with more decency . occasion have she to boast of she birth , that know not what belong to good manners . I say , I be very sorry , sir , to be the unhappy occasion of a misunderstanding between so good a brother and so worthy a sister . do not say so , , because this be a unavoidable consequence of the happy prospect before we . only bear it well yourself , because she be my sister ; and leave it to I to make she sensible of she own rashness . if , sir , say I , the most lowly behaviour , and humble deportment , and in every thing shew a dutiful regard to good , will have any weight with she ladyship , assure yourself of all in my power to mollify she . no , , return he ; do not imagine , when you be my wife , I will suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that character . I know the duty of a husband , and will protect you gentleness to the utmost , as much as if you be a princess by descent . you be inexpressibly good , sir , say I ; but I be far from take a gentle disposition to show a meanness of spirit : and this be a trial I ought to expect ; and well I may bear it , that have so many benefit to set against it , which all spring from the same cause . well , say he , all the matter shall be this : we will talk of we marriage as a thing to be do next week . I find I have spy upon I wherever I go , and whatever I do : but now , I be on so laudable a pursuit , that I value they not , nor those who employ they . I have already order my servants to have no conference with any body for ten or twelve day to come . and tell I every one name come se'nnight for we nuptial . so I will get , who want to see my little chapel , to assist , under the notion of breakfast with I next morning , since you will not have it sooner ; and there will nobody else be want ; and I will beg of to keep it private , even from he own family , for a few day . have my girl any objection ? o , sir , answer I , you be so generous in all you way , I can have no objection ! -- but I hope Lady Davers and you will not proceed to irreconcilable length ; and when she ladyship come to see you , and to tarry with you , two or three week , as she use to do , I will keep close up , so as not to disgust she with the sight of I . well , , say he , we will talk of that afterwards . you must do then as I shall think fit : and I shall be able to judge what both you and I ought to do . but what still aggravate the matter be , that she should instigate the titled ape she husband to write to I , after she have so little succeed herself . I wish I have keep he letter , that I might have shewn you how a man , that generally act like a fool , can take upon he to write like a lord . but I suppose it be of my sister 's penning , and he , poor man ! be the humble copier . . be return from you , my dear father , with the good news of you health , and you proceeding in you journey to my dear mother , where I hope to hear soon you be arrive . my master have just now be make I play upon the spinnet , and s to it ; and be pleased to commend I for both . but he do so for every thing I do , so partial do he goodness make he to I . one o'clock . we be just return from a airing in the chariot ; and I have be delighted with he conversation upon English author , poet particularly . he entertain I also with a description of some of the curiosity he have see in and , when he make what the polite world call the grand tour . he say he want to be at he other seat , for he know not well how to employ himself here , have not propose to stay half the time : and when I get there , , say he , you will hardly be trouble with so much of my company , after we have settle ; for I have a great many thing to adjust : and I must go to ; for I have account that have run on longer than ordinary with my banker there . and I do not know , add he , but the ensue winter I may give you a little taste of
of the diversion of the town for a month or so . I say , he will and pleasure should determine mine ; and I never would , as near as I could , have a desire after those , or any other entertainment that be not in he own choice . he be pleased to say , I make no doubt but that I shall be very happy in you ; and hope you will be so in I : for , say he , I have no very enormous vice to gratify ; though I pretend not to the greatest purity , neither , my girl . , say I , if you can account to you own mind , I shall always be easy in whatever you do . but we greatest happiness here , sir , continue I , be of very short duration ; and this life , at the longest , be a poor transitory one ; and I hope we shall be so happy as to be enable to look forward , with comfort , to another , where we pleasure will be everlast . you say well , ; and I shall , by degree , be more habituate to this way of think , as I more and more converse with you ; but , at present , you must not be over serious with I all at once : though I charge you never forbear to mingle you sweet divinity in we conversation , whenever it can be bring in a propo , and with such a cheerfulness of temper , as shall not throw a gloomy cloud over we innocent enjoyment . I be abash at this , and silent , fear I have offend : but he say , if you attend rightly to what I say , I need not tell you again , , not to be discourage from suggest to I , on every proper occasion , the pious impulse of you own amiable mind . , say I , you will be always indulgent , I make no doubt , to my imperfection , so long as I mean well . my master make I dine with he , and would eat nothing but what I help he to ; and my heart be , every hour , more and more enlarge with he goodness and condescension . but still , what ail I , I wonder ! a strange sort of weight hang upon my mind , as draw on , which make I often sigh involuntarily , and damp , at time , the pleasure of my delightful prospect !-- I hope this be not ominous ; but only the foolish weakness of a over-thoughtful mind , on a occasion the most solemn and important of one 's life , next to the last scene , which shut up all . I could be very serious : but I will commit all my way to that bless Providence , which hitherto have so wonderfully conduct I through real evils to this hopeful situation . I only fear , and surely I have great reason , that I shall be too unworthy to hold the affections of so dear a gentleman ! -- teach I humility , and to know my own demerit ! and this will be , next to he grace , my surest guard , in the state of life to which , though most unworthy , I be go to be exalt . and do not cease you prayer for I , my dear parent ; for , perhaps , this new condition may be subject to still worse hazard than those I have escape ; as would be the case , be conceitedness , vanity , and pride , to take hold of my frail heart ; and if I be , for my sins , to be leave to my own conduct , a frail bark in a tempestuous ocean , without ballast , or other pilot than my own inconsiderate will . but my master say , on another occasion , that those who doubt most , always er least ; and I hope I shall always doubt my own strength , my own worthiness . I will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable thing that pass in conversation with my excellent benefactor ; nor with the civility of , , and all the servants , who seem to be highly pleased with I , and with my conduct to they : and as my master , hithertoo , find no fault that I go too low , nor they that I carry it too high , I hope I shall continue to have every body 's good - will : but yet will I not seek to gain any one 's by little meanness or debasement ! but aim at a uniform and regular conduct , willing to conceal involuntary error , as I would have my own forgiven ; and not too industrious to discover real one , or to hide such , if any such should appear , as might encourage bad heart , or unclean hand , in material case , where my master should receive damage , or where the morals of the transgressor should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt . in short , I will endeaavor , as much as I can , that good servants shall find in I a kind encourager ; indifferent one be make better , by inspire they with a laudable emulation ; and bad one , if not too bad in nature , and quite irreclaimable , reform by kindness , expostulation , and even proper menace , if necessary ; but most by a good example : all this if pleasis . . now , my dear parent , I have but this one day between I and the most solemn rite that
that can be perform . my heart can not yet shake off this heavy weight . sure I be ungrateful to the divine goodness , and the favour of the best of benefactor ! -- yet I hope I be not !-- for , at time , my mind be all exultation , with the prospect of what good to - morrow 's happy solemnity may possibly , by the leave of my generous master , put it in my power to do . of how shall I find word to express , as I ink , my thankfulness , for all the mercy before I ! evening . my dear master be all love and tenderness . he see my weakness , and generously pity and comfort I ! I beg to be excuse supper ; but he bring I down himself from my closet , and place I by he , bid not wait . I could not eat , and yet I try , for fear he should be angry . he kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful , yet delightful to - morrow ! and put , now and then , a little bit on my plate , and guide it to my mouth . I be concerned to receive he goodness with so ill a grace . well , say he , if you will not eat with I , drink at least with I : I drank two glass by he over-persuasion , and say , I be really asham of myself . why , indeed , say he , my dear girl , I be not a very dreadful enemy , I hope ! I can not bear any thing that be the least concern to you . oh , sir ! say I , all be owe to the sense I have of my own unworthiness !-- to be sure , it can not be any thing else . he ring for the thing to be take away ; and then reach a chair , and sit down by I , and put he kind arm about I , and say the most generous and affect thing that ever dropt from the honey - flow mouth of love . all I have not time to repeat : some I will . and oh ! indulge you foolish daughter , who trouble you with she weak nonsense ; because what she have to say , be so affect to she ; and because , if she go to bed , instead of scribbling , she could not sleep . this sweet confusion and thoughtfulness in my beloved , say the kind man , on the near approach of we happy union , when I hope all doubt be clear up , and nothing of dishonour be apprehend , show I most abundantly , what a wretch I be to attempt such purity with a worse intention -- no wonder , that one so virtuous should find herself desert of life itself on a violence so dreadful to she honour , and seek a refuge in the shadow of death . -- but now , my dearest , that you have see a purity on my side , as nearly imitat you own , as we sex can show to yours ; and since I have , all the day long , suppress even the least intimation of the come day , that I might not alarm you tender mind ; why all this concern , why all this affect , yet sweet confusion ? you have a generous friend , my dear girl , in I ; a protector now , not a violator of you innocence : why then , once more I ask , this strange perplexity , this sweet confusion ? of sir , say I , and hide my face on he arm ; expect not reason from a foolish creature : you should have still indulge I in my closet : I be ready to beat myself for this ungrateful return to you goodness . but I know not what !-- I be , to be sure , a silly creature ! o have you but suffer I to stay by myself above , I should have make myself asham of so culpable a behaviour ! -- but goodness add to goodness every moment , and the sense of my own unworthiness , quite overcome my spirits . now , say the generous man , will I , though reluctantly , make a proposal to my sweet girl .-- if I have be too press for the day : if another day will still be more obliging : if you have fear you will not then have ; you shall say but the word , and I will submit . yes , my ; for though I have , these three day past , think every tedious hour a day , till come , if you earnestly desire it , I will postpone it . say , my dear girl , freely say ; but accept not my proposal , without great reason , which yet I will not ask for . , say I , I can expect nothing but superlative goodness , I have be so long use to it from you . this be a most generous instance of it ; but I fear -- yes , I fear it will be too much the same thing , some day hence , when the happy , yet , fool that I be ! dread time , shall be equally near ! kind , lovely charmer ! say he , now do I see you be to be trust with power , from the generous use you make of it ! -- not one offensive word or look , from I , shall wound you nicest thought ; but pray try to subdue this
this over-scrupulousness , and unseasonable timidity . I persuade myself you will if you can . indeed , sir , I will , say I ; for I be quite asham of myself , with all these lovely view before I !-- the honour you do I , the kindness you show I !-- I can not forgive myself ! for , oh ! if I know the least of this idle foolish heart of mine , it have not a misgiving thought of you goodness ; and I should abhor it , if it be capable of the least affectation .-- but , dear good sir , leave I a little to myself , and I will take myself to a severer task than you goodness will let you do and I will present my heart before you , a worthier offering to you , than at present its wayward folly will let it seem to be . -- but one thing be , one have no kind friend of one 's own sex , to communicate one 's foolish thought to , and to be strengthen by they comforting ! but I be leave to myself ; and , oh ! what a weak silly thing I be ! he kindly withdraw , to give I time to recollect myself ; and in about half a hour return : and then , that he might not begin at once upon the subject , and say , at the same time , something agreeable to I , say , you father and mother have have a great deal of talk by this time about you , . o , sir , return I , you goodness have make they quite happy ! but I can not help be concerned about . he say , I be vex I do not hear the footman out ; because it run in my head he talk somewhat about she come hither . she will meet with but a indifferent reception from I , unless she come resolve to behave better than she write . pray , sir , say I , be pleased to bear with my good lady , for two reason . what be they ? say he . why , first , sir , answer I , because she be you sister ; and , to be sure , may very well think , what all the world will , that you have much undervalue yourself in make I happy . and next , because , if she ladyship find you out of temper with she , it will still aggravate she more against I ; and every time that any warm word you may have between you , come into she mind , she will disdain I more . do not concern yourself about it , say he ; for we have more proud lady than she in we other neighbourhood , who , perhaps , have still less reason to be punctilious about they descent , and yet will form themselves upon she example , and say , why , he own sister will not forgive he , nor visit he ! and so , if I can subdue she spirit , which be more than she husband ever could , or indeed any body else , it be a great point gai : and , if she give I reason , I will try for it , I assure you . well , but , my dear girl , continue he , since the subject be so important , may I not say one word about to - morrow ? , say I , I hope I shall be less a fool : I have talk as harshly to my heart , as Lady Davers can do ; and the naughty thing suggest to I a better , and more grateful behaviour . he smile , and , kiss I , say , I take notice , , of what you observe , that you have none of you own sex with you ; I think it be a little hard upon you ; and I should have like you should have have ; but then she sister must have be ask ; and I might as well make a public wedding : which , you know , would have require clothes and other preparation . besides , add he , a foolish proposal be once make I of that second sister , who have two or three thousand pound more than the other , leave she by a godmother , and she can not help be a little pique ; though , say he , it be a proposal they could not expect should succeed ; for there be nothing in she person nor mind ; and she fortune , as that must have be the only inducement , would not do by any means ; and so I discourage it at once . I be think , sy , say I , of another mortify thing too ; that be you to marry a lady of birth and fortune answerable to you own , all the eve to the day would be take up in reading , signing , and seal of settlement , and portion , and such like : but now the poor Pamela bring you nothing at all : and the very clothes she wear , so very low be she , be entirely the effect of you bounty , and that of you good mother : this make I a little sad : for , ala ! sir , I be so much oppress by you favour , and the sense of the obligation I lie under , that I can not look up with the confidence that I otherwise should , on this awful occasion . there be , my dear , say he , where the power be want
want , as much generosity in the will as in the action . to all that know you story , and you merit , it will appear that I can not recompense you for what I have make you suffer . you have have too many hard struggle and exercise ; and have nobly overcome : and who shall grudge you the reward of the hard - buy victory ?-- this affair be so much the act of my own will , that I glory in be capable of distinguishing so much excellence ; and my fortune be the more pleasurable to I , as it give I hope , that I may make you some part of satisfaction for what you have undergone . this , sir , say I , be all goodness , unmerit on my side ; and make my obligation the greater . I can only wish for more worthiness .-- but how poor be it to offer nothing but word for such generous deed !-- and to say , I wish ! -- for what be a wish , but the acknowledge want of power to oblige , and a demonstration of one 's poverty in every thing but will ? and that , my dear girl , say he , be every thing : ' all I want : ' Tis all that itself require of we : but no more of these little doubt , though they be the natural impulse of a generous and grateful heart : I want not to be employ in settlement . those be for such to regard , who make convenience and fortune the prime consideration . I have possession ample enough for we both ; and you deserve to share they with I ; and you shall do it , with as little reserve , as if you have bring I what the world reckon a equivalent : for , as to my own opinion , you bring I what be infinitely more valuable , a experienced truth , a well - try virtue , and a wit and behaviour more than equal to the station you will be place in : to say nothing of this sweet person , that itself might captivate a monarch ; and of the meekness of temper , and sweetness of disposition , which make you superior to all the woman I ever see . thus kind and soothing , and honourably affectionate , be the dear gentleman , to the unworthy , doubt , yet assure ; and thus patiently do he indulge , and generously pardon , my impertinent weakness . he offer to go himself to , in the morning , and reveal the matter to she , and desire she secrecy and presence ; but I say , that would disoblige the young lady . no , sir , say I , I will cast myself upon you generous kindness ; for why should I fear the kind protector of my weakness , and the guide and director of my future step ? you cannot , say he , forgive ; for she must know it ; and suffer she to be with you ? yes , sir , say I , I can . she be very civil to I now : and she former wickedness I will forgive , for the sake of the happy fruit that have attend it ; and because you mention she . well , say he , I will call she in , if you please .-- as you please , sir , say I . and he ring for she ; and when she come in , he say , . Jewkes , I be go to entrust you with a secret . , answer she , I will be sure to keep it as such . why , say he , we intend to - morrow , privately as possible , for we wedding - day ; and and be to be here , as to breakfast with I , and to show my little chapel . as soon as the ceremony be over , we will take a little airing in the chariot , as we have do at other time ; and so it will not be wonder that we be dress . and the two parson have promise secrecy , and will go home . I believe you can not well avoid let one of the maid into the secret ; but that I will leave to you . , reply she , we all conclude it would be in a few day ! and I doubt it will not be long a secret . no , say he , I do not desire it should ; but you know we be not provide for a public wedding , and I shall declare it when we go to , which will not be long . but the man , who lie in the outhouse , need not know it ; for , by some means or other , my sister know all that pass . do you know , sir , say she , that she ladyship intend to be down here with you in a few day ? she servant tell I so , who bring you the letter you be angry at . I hope , say he , we shall be set out for t'other house first ; and shall be pleased she lose she labour . , continue she , she ladyship , propose to be here time enough to hinder you nuptial , which she take , as we do , will be the latter end of next week . well , say he , let she come : but yet I desire not to see she . say to I , give I leave , madam , to wish you all manner of happiness : but I be
be afraid I have too well obey he honour , to be forgive by you . indeed , , return I , you will be more you own enemy than I will be . I will look all forward : and shall not presume , so much as by a whisper , to set my good master against any one he please to approve off : and as to he old servant , I shall always value they , and never offer to dictate to he choice , or influence it by my own caprice . , say my master , you find you have no cause to apprehend any thing . my Pamela be very placable ; and as we have both be sinner together , we must both be include in one act of grace . such a example of condescension , as I have before I , Jewkes , say I , may make you very easy ; for I must be highly unworthy , if I do not forego all my little resentment , if I have any , for the sake of so much goodness to myself . you be very kind , madam , say she ; and you may depend upon it , I will ato for all my fault , by my future duty and respect to you , as well as to my master . that be well say on both side , say he : but , , to assure you , that my good girl here have no malice , she choose you to attend she in the morning at the ceremony , and you must keep up she spirit .-- I shall , reply she , be very proud of the honour : but I cannot , madam , but wonder to see you so very low - spirit , as you have be these two or three day past , with so much happiness before you . why , , answer I , there can be but one reason give ; and that be , that I be a sad fool ! -- but , indeed , I be not ungrateful neither ; nor would I put on a foolish affectation : but my heart , at time , sink within I ; I know not why , except at my own unworthiness , and because the honour do I be too high for I to support myself under , as I should do . it be a honour , , add I , I be not bear to ; and no wonder , then , I behave so awkwardly . she make I a fine compliment upon it , and withdrew , repeat she promise of care , secrecy , etc . he part from I with very great tenderness ; and I come up and set to write , to amuse my thought , and write thus far . and be come up , and it be past twelve , I will go to bed ; but not one wink , I fear , shall I get this night .-- I could beat myself for anger . sure there be nothing ominous in this strange folly ! -- but I suppose all young maiden be the same , so near so great a change of condition , though they carry it off more discreetly than I . , six o'clock in the morning . I might as well have not go to bed last night , for what sleep I have . often be talk to I , and say several thing that would have be well enough from any body else of we sex ; but the poor woman have so little purity of heart , that it be all say from she , and go no farther than the ear . I fancy my master have not sleep much neither ; for I hear he up , and walk about he chamber , ever since break of day . to be sure , good gentleman ! he must have some concern , as well as I ; for here he be go to marry a poor foolish unworthy girl , bring up on the charity , as one may say , ( at least bounty , ) of he worthy family ! and this foolish girl must be , to all intent and purpose , after twelve o'clock this day , as much he wife , as if he be to marry a duchess ! -- and here he must stand the shocks of common reflection ! the great ---- have do finely ! he have marry he poor servant wench ! will some say . the ridicule and rude jest of he equal , and companion too , he must stand : and the disdain of he relation , and indignation of , he lofy sister ! dear good gentleman ! he will have enough to do , to be sure ! of how shall I merit all these thing at he hand ! I can only do the best I can ; and pray to to reward he ; and resolve to love he with a pure heart , and serve he with a sincere obedience . I hope the dear gentleman will continue to love I for this ; for , alas ! I have nothing else to offer ! but , as I can hardly expect so great a blessing , if I can be secure from he contempt , I shall not be unfortunate ; and must bear he indifference , if he rich friend should inspire he with it , and proceed with do my duty with cheerfulness . half a hour past eight o'clock . my good dear master , my kind friend , my generous benefactor , my worthy protector , and , oh ! all the good word in one , my affectionate husband ,
, that be soon to be --( be curb in , my proud heart , know thy self , and be conscious of thy unworthiness ! ) -- have just leave I , with the kindest , tenderest expression , and gentlest behaviour , that ever blest a happy maiden . he approach I with a sort of reine - in rapture . my Pamela ! say he , may I just ask after you employment ? do not let I chide my dear girl this day , however . the two parson will be here to breakfast with we at nine ; and yet you be not a bit dress ! why this absence of mind , and sweet irresolution ? why , indeed , sir , say I , I will set about a reformation this instant . he see the common - prayer book lie in the window . I hope , say he , my lovely maiden have be con the lesson she be by - and - by to repeat . have you not , ? and clasp he arm about I , and kiss I . indeed , sir , say I , I have be read over the solemn service .-- and what think my fairest ( for so he call I ) of it ?-- of sir , ' ti very awful , and make one shudder , to reflect upon it !-- no wonder , say he , it should affect my sweet Pamela : I have be look into it this morning , and I can not say but I think it a solemn , but very suitable service . but this I tell my dear love , continue he , and again clasp I to he , there be not a tittle in it that I can not joyfully subscribe to : and that , my dear , should make you easy , and join cheerfully in it with I . I kiss he dear hand : of my generous , kind protector , say I , how gracious be it to confirm thus the doubting mind of you poor servant ! which apprehend nothing so much as she own unworthiness of the honour and bless that await she ! -- he be pleased to say , I know well , my dearest creature , that , accord to the libertie we people of fortune generally give ourselves , I have promise a great deal , when I say so . but I would not have say it , if , deliberately , I could not with all my heart . so banish from you mind all doubt and uneasiness ; let a generous confidence in I take place ; and let I see it do , by you cheerfulness in this day 's solemn business ; and then I will love you for ever ! , , say I , reward all you goodness to I !-- that be all I can say . but , oh ! how kind it be in you , to supply the want of the presence and comforting of a dear mother , of a loving sister , or of the kind companion of my own sex , which most maiden have , to soothe they anxiety on the so near approach of so awful a solemnity ! -- you , sir , be all these tender relation in one to I ! you condescension and kindness shall , if possible , embole I to look up to you without that sweet terror , that must confound poor bashful maiden , on such a occasion , when they be surrendere up to a more doubtful happiness , and to half - strange man , whose good faith , and good usage of they , must be less experienced , and be all involved in the dark bosom of futurity , and only to be prove by the event . this , my dear , say he , be most kindly say ! it shew I that you enter gratefully into my intention . for I would , by my conduct , supplly all these dear relation to you ; and I voluntarily promise , from my heart , to you , what I think I could not , with such assure resolution of performance , to the highest - bear lady in the kingdom . for let I tell my sweet girl , that , after have be long toss by the boisterous wind of a more culpable passion , I have now conquer it , and be not so much the victim of you beauty , all charming as you be , as of you virtue ; and therefore may more boldly promise for myself , have so stable a foundation for my affection ; which , should this outward beauty fail , will increase with you virtue , and shine forth the brighter , as that be more illustriously display by the augmented opportunity which the condition you be now enter into will afford you .--o the dear charming man ! how nobly , how encouragingly kind , be all this ! I could not suitably express myself : and he say , I see my girl be at a loss for word ! I doubt not you kind acceptance of my declaration . and when I have act too much the part of a libertine formerly , for you to look back without some anxiety , I ought not , be now happily convict , to say less . -- but why lose my girl she time ? I will now only add , that I hope for many happy year to make good , by my conduct , what so willingly flow from my lip . he kiss I again , and say , but , whatever you do , , be cheerful ; for else , may be
be , of the small company we shall have , some one , not know how to account for you too nice modesty , will think there be some other person in the world , whose addresses would be still more agreeable to you . this he say with a air of sweetness and pleasantry ; but it alarme I exceedingly , and make I resolve to appear as calm and cheerful as possible . for this be , indeed , a most affecting expression , and enough to make I , if any thing can , behave as I ink , and to force my idle fear to give way to hope so much better grounde .-- and I begin almost , on this occasion , to wish be not to marry I , lest I should behave like a fool ; and so be liable to a imputation , which I should be most unworthy , if I deserv . so I set about dress I instantly ; and he send to assist I . but I be never long a dressing , when I set about it ; and my master have now give I a hint , that will , for half a hour more , at least , keep my spirits in a brisk circulation . yet it concern I a little too , lest he should have any the least shadow of a doubt , that I be not , mind and person , entirely he . and so be now ready , and not call to breakfast , I sit down and write thus far . I might have mention , that I dress myself in a rich white satin night - gown , that have be my good lady 's , and my best head - clothes , etc . I have get such a knack of writing , that when I be by myself , I can not sit without a pen in my hand . -- but I be now call to breakfast . I suppose the gentleman be come .-- now , courage , ! remember thou art upon thy good behaviour !-- Fie upon it ! my heart begin to flutter again ! -- Foolish heart ! be still ! never , sure , be any maiden 's perverse heart under so little command as mine !-- it give itself away , at first , without my leave ; it have be , for week , press I with its wish ; and yet now , when it should be happy itself , and make I so , it be throb , throb , throb , like a little fool ! and fill I with such unseasonable misgiving , as abate the rise comfort of all my better prospect . , near three o'clock . I think I should have find no time nor heart to write again this day . but here be three gentleman come , unexpectedly , to dine with my master ; and so I shall not appear . he have do all he could , civilly , to send they away ; but they will stay , though I believe he have rather they would not . and so I have nothing to do but to write till I go to dinner myself with : for my master be not prepare for this company ; and it will be a little latish to - day . so I will begin with my happy story where I leave off . when I come down to breakfast , and be both there . and as soon as my master hear I come down , he meet I at the door , and lead I in with great tenderness . he have kindly speak to they , as he tell I afterwards , to mention no more of the matter to I , than need must . I pay my respects to they , I believe a little awkwardly , and be almost out of breath : but say , I have come down a little too fast . when come in to wait , my master say , ( that the servants should not mistrust , ) ' Tis well , gentlemen , you come as you do ; for my good girl and I be go to take a airing till dinner - time . I hope you will stay and dine with I . , say , we will not hinder you airing . I only come , have a little time upon my hand , to see you chapel ; but must be at home at dinner ; and will dine with I . well then , say my master , we will pursue we intention , and ride out for a hour or two , as soon as I have shew my little chapel . will you , , after breakfast , walk with we to it ? if , if , say I , and have like to have stammered , foolish that I be ! if you please , sir . I could look none of they in the face . look at I ; why , child , say my master , you have hardly recover you fright yet : how come you foot to slip ? ' Tis well you do not hurt yourself . , improve the hint , you ha ' not sprain you ancle , madam , I hope . no , sir , say I , I believe not ; but ' ti a little painful to I . and so it be ; for I mean my foolishness ! , say my master , bid put the horse to the coach , instead of the chariot ; and if these gentleman will go , we can set they down . no matter , sir , say : I have as lieve walk ,
, if choose it . well then , say my master , let it be the chariot , as I tell he . I could eat nothing , though I attempt it ; and my hand shook so , I spill some of my chocolate , and so put it down again ; and they be all very good , and look another way . my master say , when be out , I have a quite plain ring here , : and I hope the ceremony will dignify the ring ; and that I shall give my girl reason to think it , for that cause , the most valuable one that can be present she . say , he be sure I should value it more than the richest diamond in the world . I have by not to dress herself , lest she should give cause of mistrust ; and she take my advice . when breakfast be over , my master say , before , well , gentlemen , we will step into the chapel ; and you must give I you advice , as to the alteration I design . I be in the more haste , because the survey you be go to take of it , for the alteration , will take up a little time ; and we shall have but a small space between that and dinner , for the little tour I design to make .-- , you will give we you opinion , will not you ? yes , sir , say I ; I will come after you . so they go out , and I sit down in the chair again , and fan myself : I be sick at heart , say I , I think , . say she , shall I fetch you a little cordial ?-- no , say I , I be a sad fool ! I want spirit , that be all . she take she smell - bottle , and would have give it I : but I say , keep it in you hand ; may be I shall want it : but I hope not . she give I very good word , and beg I to go : and I get up ; but my knee beat so against one another , I be force to sit down again . but , at last , I hold by she arm , and pass by , I say , this ugly slip , come down stairs , have make I limp , though ; so I must hold by you , . do you know what alteration there be to be in the chapel , that we must all give we opinion of they ? , she tell I , be let into the secret ; and she have order she to stay at the chapel door , to see that nobody come in . my dear master come to I , at enter the chapel , and take my hand , and lead I up to the altar . remember , my dear girl , whisper he , and be cheerful . I be , I will , sir , say I ; but I hardly know what I say ; and so you may believe , when I say to , do not leave I ; pray , , do not leave I ; as if I have all confidence in she , and none where it be most due . so she keep close to I . God forgive I ! but I never be so absent in my life , as at first ; even till have go on in the service , so far as to the awful word about require we , as we should answer at the dreadful day of judgment ; and then the solemn word , and my master 's whispering , mind this , my dear , make I start . say he , still whisper , know you any impediment ? I blush , and say softly , none , sir , but my great unworthiness . then follow the sweet word , will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife ? etc. and I begin to take heart a little , when my dearest master answer , audibly , to this question , I will . but I could only make a courtesy , when they ask I ; though , I be sure , my heart be readier than my speech , and answer to every article of obey , serve , love , and honour . give I away ; and I say , after , as well as I could , as my dear master do with a much better , the word of betrothment ; and the ceremony of the ring passing next , I receive the dear favour at he worthy hand with a most grateful heart ; and he be pleased to say afterwards in the chariot , that when he have do say , with this ring I thee we , etc . I make a courtesy , and say , thank you , sir . may be I do ; for I be sure it be a most grateful part of the service , and my heart be overwhelmed with he goodness , and the tender grace wherewith he perform it . I be very glad , that the next part be the prayer , and knee ; for I tremble so , I could hardly stand , betwixt fear and joy . the joining of we hand afterwards , the declaration of we be marry to the few witness present ; for , reckon , whose curiosity would not let she stay at the door , there be but , , and she ; the bless , the psalm , and the subsequent prayer , and the
the conclude exhortation ; be so many beautiful , welcome , and lovely part of this divine office , that my heart begin to be delighted with they ; and my spirit to be a little freer . and thus , my dearest , dear parent , be you happy , happy , thrice happy , at last married ; and to whom ?-- why , to she beloved , gracious master ! the lord of she wish ! and thus the dear , once naughty assailer of she innocence , by a blessed turn of , be become the kind , the generous protector and rewarder of it . be evermore bless and praise ! and make I not wholly unworthy of such a transcendent honour !-- and bless and reward the dear , dear , good gentleman , who have thus exalt he unworthy servant , and give she a place , which the greatest lady would think themselves happy in ! my master salute I most ardently , and say , give you , my dear love , as much joy on this occasion , as I have ! and he present I to , who salute I ; and say , you may excuse I , dear madam , for I give you away , and you be my daughter . and modestly withdraw a little way ; , say my master , pray accept my thanks , and wish you sister joy . so he salute I too ; and say , Most heartily , madam , I do . and I will say , that to see so much innocence and virtue so eminently reward , be one of the greatest pleasure I have ever kny . this my master take very kindly . would have kiss my hand at the chapel - door ; but I put my arm about she neck , for I have get a new recruit of spirit just then ; and kiss she , and say , thank you , , for accompany I . I have behave sadly . no , madam , say she , pretty well , pretty well ! walk out with I ; and Williams and my master come out after we , talk together . , when we come into the parlour , say , I once more , madam , must wish you joy on this happy occasion . I wish every day may add to you comforts ; and may you very long rejoice in one another ! for you be the loveliest couple I ever see join . I tell he , I be highly oblige to he kind opinion , and good wish ; and hope my future conduct would not make I unworthy of they . my good benefactor come in with : so , my dear life , say he , how do you do ? a little more compose , I hope . well , you see this be not so dreadful a affair as you apprehend . , say , very kindly , it be a very solemn circumstance ; and I love to see it so reverently and awfully enter upon . it be a most excellent sign ; for the most thoughtful beginning make the most prudent proceedings . , of she own accord , come in with a large silver tumbler , fill with sack , and a toast , and nutmeg , and sugar ; and my master say , that be well think of , ; for we have make but sorry breakfasting . and he would make I , take some of the toast ; as they all do , and drank pretty heartily : and I drank a little , and it cheer my heart , I think , for a hour after . my master take a fine diamond ring from he finger , and present it to , who receive it very kindly . and to he say , my old acquaintance , I have reserve for you , against a variety of solicitation , the liive I always design for you ; and I beg you will prepare to take possession of it ; and as the do it may be attend with some expense , pray accept of this towards it ; and so he give he ( as he tell I afterwards it be ) a bank note of 50 l . so do this generous good gentleman bless we all , and I in particular ; for whose sake he be as bounteous as if he have marry one of the noblest fortune . so he take he leave of the gentleman , recommend secrecy again , for a few day , and they leave he ; and none of the servants suspect any thing , as believe . and then I throw myself at he foot , bless , and bless he for he goodness ; and he overwhelm I with kindness , call I he sweet bride , and twenty lovely epithet , that swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance . he afterwards lead I to the chariot ; and we take a delightful tour round the neighbour villag ; and he do all he could to dissipate those still perverse anxiety that dwell upon my mind , and , do what I can , spread too thoughtful a air , as he tell I , over my countenance . we come home again by half a hour after one ; and he be pleasing himself will think , not to be a hour out of my company this bless day , that ( as he be so good as to say ) he might inspire I with a familiarity that should improve my confidence in he , when he be tell , that a footman of have be here , to let he know , that
that he master , and two other gentleman , be on the road to take a dinner with he , in they way to . he be heartily vex at this , and say to I , he should have be glad of they company at any other time ; but that it be a barbarous intrusion now ; and he wish they have be tell he would not be at home at dinner : and besides , say he , they be horrid drinker ; and I sha not be able to get they away to - night , perhaps ; for they have nothing to do , but to travel round the country , and beat up they friend 's quarter all the way ; and it be all one to they , whether they stay a night or a month at a place . but , add he , I will find some way , if I can , to turn they off , after dinner .-- Confound they , say he , in a violent pet , that they should come this day , of all the day in the year ! we have hardly alighted , and get in , before they come : three mad rake they seem to be , as I look through the window , set up a hunt note , as soon as they come to the gate , that make the court - yard echo again ; and smack they whip in concert . so I go up to my chamber , and see ( what make my heart throb ) 's officious pain to put the room in order for a guest , that , however welcome , as now my duty teach I to say , be yet dreadful to I to think off . so I take refuge in my closet , and have recourse to pen and ink , for my amusement , and to divert my anxiety of mind .-- if one 's heart be so sad , and one 's apprehension so great , where one so extremely love , and be so extremely oblige ; what must be the case of those poor maiden , who be force , for sordid view , by they tyrannical parent or guardian , to marry the man they almost hate , and , perhaps , to the loss of the man they must love ! of that be a sad thing , indeed !-- and what have not such cruel parent to answer for ! and what do not such poor innocent victim suffer !-- but , bless be , this lot be far from be mine ! my good master ( for I can not yet have the presumption to call he by a more tender name ) come up to I , and say , well , I just come to ask my dear bride ( of the charming , charme word ! ) how she do ? I see you be write , my dear , say he . these confounded rake be half mad , I think , and will make I so ! however , say he , I have order my chariot to be get ready , as if I be under a engagement five mile off , and will set they out of the house , if possible ; and then ride round , and come back , as soon as I can get rid of they . I find , say he , be full of we affair . she have take great freedom with I before Sir Charles ; and they have all be at I , without mercy ; and I be force to be very serious with they , or else they would have come up to have see you , since I would not call you down .-- he kiss I , and say , I shall quarrel with they , if I can not get they away ; for I have lose two or three precious hour with my soul 's delight : and so he go down . ask I to walk down to dinner in the little parlour . I go down , and she be so complaisant as to offer to wait upon I at table ; and would not be persuade , without difficulty , to sit down with I . but I insist she should : for , say I , it would be very extraordinary , if one should so soon go into such distance , . -- whatever my new station may require of I , add I , I hope I shall always conduct myself in such a manner , that pride and insolence shall bear no part in my character . you be very good , madam , say she ; but I will always know my duty to my master 's lady .-- why then , reply I , if I must take state upon I so early , Jewkes , let I exact from you what you call you duty ; and sit down with I when I desire you . this prevail upon she ; and I make shift to get down a bit of apple - pye , and a little custard ; but that be all . my good master come in again , and say , well , thank my star ! these rake be go now ; but I must set out with they , and I choose my chariot ; for if I take horse , I should have difficulty to part with they ; for they be like a snowball , and intend to gather company as they go , to make a merry tour of it for some day together . we both get up , when he come in : , ! say he ; why this ceremony now ?-- sit still ,
, . -- , , say she , I be loath to sit down ; but my lady would have I .-- she be very right , , say my master , and tap I on the cheek ; for we be but yet half marry ; and so she be not above half you lady yet !-- do not look so down , do not be so silent , my dearest , say he ; why , you hardly speak twenty word to I all the time we be out together . something I will allow for you bashful sweetness ; but not too much .-- , have you no pleasant tale to tell my , to make she smile , till I return ?--yes , sy , say she , I could tell twenty pleasant story ; but my lady be too nice to hear they ; and yet , I hope , I should not be shocke neither . ah ! poor woman ! think I ; thy chastest story will make a modest person blush , if I know thee ! and I desire to hear none of they . my master say , tell she one of the shortest you have , in my hearing . why , sir , say she , I know a bashful young lady , as madam may be , marry to -- dear , interrupt I , no more of you story , I beseech you ; I do not like the beginning of it . go on , , say my master . no , pray , sir , do not require it , say I , pray do not . well , say he , then we will have it another time , . Abrahbe come in to tell he the gentleman be go , and that he chariot be ready ; I be glad of that , say he ; and go to they , and set out with they . I take a turn in the garden with , after they be go : and have walk a while , I say , I should be glad of she company down the elm - walk , to meet the chariot : for , o ! I know not how to look up at he , when he be with I ; nor how to bear he absence , when I have reason to expect he : what a strange contradiction there be in this unaccountable passion . what a different aspect every thing in and about this house bear now , to my thinking , to what it once have ! the garden , the pond , the alcove , the elm - walk . but , oh ! my prison be become my palace ; and no wonder every thing wear another face ! we sit down upon the broad stile , lead towards the road ; and be quite another person to I , to what she be the last time I sit there . at last my best beloved return , and alight there . what , my ! ( and then leave I , ) what ( say he , and kiss I ) bring you this way ? I hope to meet I .-- yes , sy , say I . that be kind , indeed , say he ; but why that avert eye ?-- that downcast countenance , as if you be afraid of I ? you must not think so , sir , say I . revive my heart then , say he , with a more cheerful aspect ; and let that over -anxious solicitude , which appear in the most charming face in the world , be chase from it .-- have you , my dear girl any fear that I can dissipate ; any doubt that I can obviate ; any hope that I can encourage ; any request that I can gratify ? -- , my dear Pamela ; and if I have power , but speak , and to purchase one smile , it shall be do ! I cannot , sy , say I , have any fear , any doubt , but that I shall never be able to deserve all you goodness . I have no hope , but that my future conduct may be agreeable to you , and my determined duty well accept . have I any request to make , but that you will forgive all my imperfection and , among the rest , this foolish weakness , that make I seem to you , after all the generous thing that have pass , to want this further condescension , and these kind assurance . but indeed , sir , I be oppress by you bounty ; my spirit sink under the weight of it ; and the oppression be still the greater , as I see not how , possibly , in my whole future life , by all I can do , to merit the least of you favour . I know you grateful heart , say he ; but remember , my dear , what the lawyer tell we , that marriage be the highest consideration which the law know . and this , my sweet bride , have make you mine , and I yours ; and you have the best claim in the world to share my fortune with I . but , set that consideration aside , what be the obligation you have to I ? you mind be pure as that of a angel , and as much transcend mine . you wit , and you judgament , to make you no compliment , be more than equal to mine : you have all the graces that education can give a woman , improve by a genius which make those graces natural to you . you have a sweetness of
of temper , and a noble sincerity , beyond all comparison ; and in the beauty of you person , you excel all the lady I ever see . where then , my dearest , be the obligation , if not on my side to you , to avoid these comparison , let we talk of nothing henceforth but equality ; although , if the riche of you mind , and you unblemished virtue , be set against my fortune , ( which be but a accidental good , as I may call it , and all I have to boast of , ) the condescension will be yours ; and I shall not think I can possibly deserve you , till , after you sweet example , my future life shall become nearly as blameless as yours . o , sir , say I , what comfort do you give I , that , instead of my be in danger of be ensnar by the high condition to which you goodness have exalt I , you make I hope , that I shall be confirm and approve by you ; and that we may have a prospect of perpetuat each other 's happiness , till time shall be no more !-- but , sir , I will not , as you once caution I , be too serious . I will resolve , with these sweet encouragement , to be , in every thing , what you would have I be : and I hope I shall , more and more , show you that I have no will but yours . he kiss I very tenderly , and thanke I for this kind assurance , as he call it . and so we enter the house together . eight o'clock at night . now these sweet assurance , my dear father and mother , you will say , must be very consolatory to I ; and be voluntary on he side , be all that could be wish for on mine ; and I be resolve , if possible , to subdue my idle fear and apprehension . ten o'clock at night . as we sit at supper , he be generously kind to I , as well in he action , as expression . he take notice , in the most delicate manner , of my endeavour to conquer my foible ; and say , I see , with pleasure , my dear girl strive to comport herself in a manner suitable to my wish : I see , even through the sweet tender struggle of you over -nice modesty , how much I owe to you intention of oblige I . as I have once tell you , that I be the conquest more of you virtue than you beauty ; so not one alarming word or look shall my beloved hear or see , to give she reason to suspect the truth of what I aver . you may the rather believe I , continue he , as you may see the pain I have to behold any thing that concern you , even though you concern be causeless . and yet I will indulge my dear girl 's bashful weakness so far , as to own , that so pure a mind may suffer from apprehension , on so important a change as this ; and I can therefore be only displease with such part of you conduct , as may make you suffering greater than my own ; when I be resolve , through every stage of my future life , in all event , to study to make they less . after supper , of which , with all he sweet persuasion , I could hardly taste , he make I drink two glass of champaign , and , afterwards , a glass of sack ; which he kindly force upon I , by name you healt : and as the time of retire drew on , he take notice , but in a very delicate manner , how my colour go and come , and how foolishly I tremble . nobody , surely , in such delightful circumstance , ever behave so silly !-- and he say , my dearest girl , I fear you have have too much of my company for so many hour together ; and would better recollect yourself , if you retire for half a hour to you closet . I wish for this , but durst not say so much , lest he should be angry ; for , as the hour grow on , I find my apprehension increase , and my silly heart be the unquieter , every time I could lift up my eye to he dear face ; so sweetly terrible do he appear to my apprehension . I say , you be all goodness , dear sir ; and I boldly kiss he dear hand , and press it to my lip with both mine . and salut I very fervently , he give I he hand , see I hardly able to stand , and lead I to my chamber - door , and then most generously withdrew . I go to my closet ; and the first thing I do , on my knee , again thank for the blessing of the day ; and besotch he divine goodness to conduct my future life in such a manner , as should make I a happy instrument of he glory . after this , be now leave to my own recollection , I grow a little more assured and lightsome ; and the pen and paper be before I , I amuse myself with writing thus far . eleven o'clock night . be come up with a message , desire to know , whether she master may attend upon I in my closet ; and hint to I , that
that , however , she believe he do not expect to find I there ; I have send word , that I beg he would indulge I one quarter of a hour .--So , commit myself to the mercy of the , who have lead I through so many strange scene of terror and affrightment , to this happy , yet awful moment , I will wish you , my dear parent , a good night ; and though you will not see this in time , yet I know I have you hourly prayer , and therefore can not fail of they now . so , good night , good night ! bless you , and bless I ! amen , amen , if it be he bless will , subscribe you ever- dutiful daughter ! evening . of how this dear excellent man indulge I in every thing ! every hour he make I happier , by he sweet condescension , than the former . he pity my weakness of mind , allow for all my little foible , endeavour to dissipate my fear ; he word be so pure , he idea so chaste , and he whole behaviour so sweetly decent , that never , surly , be so happy a creature as you ! I never could have hope such a husband could have fall to my lot : and much less , that a gentleman , who have allow himself in attempt , that now I will endeaavor to forget for ever , should have behave with so very delicate and unexceptionable a demeanour . no light frothy 's drop from he lip ; no alarming raillery ; no offensive expression , nor insulting air , reproach or wound the ear of you happy , thrice happy daughter . in short , he say every thing that may embole I to look up , with pleasure , upon the generous author of my happiness . at breakfast , when I know not how to see he , he embolden I by talking of you , my dear parent ; a subject , he generously know , I could talk of : and give I assurance , that he would make you both happy . he say , he would have I send you a letter to acquaint you with my nuptial ; and , as he could make business that way , should carry it purposely , as to - morrow . will I , say he , my dear Pamela , desire to see you writing , because I tell you I would not ; for now I will , in every thing , religiously keep my word with my dear spouse : ( of the dear delightful word ! ) and you may send all you papers to they , from those they have , down to this happy moment ; only let I beg they will preserve they , and let I have they when they have read they ; as also those I have not see ; which , however , I desire not to see till then ; but then shall take it for a favour , if you will grant it . it will be my pleasure , as well as my duty , sir , say I , to obey you in every thing : and I will write up to the conclusion of this day , that they may see how happy you have make I . I know you will both join with I to bless for he wonderful mercy and goodness to you , as well as to I : for he be pleased to ask I particularly after you circumstance , and say , he have take notice , that I have hint , in some of my first letter , that you owe money in the world ; and he give I fifty guinea , and bid I send they to you in my packet , to pay you debt , as far as they would go ; and that you would quit you present business , and put yourself , and my dear mother , into a creditable appearance ; and he would find a better place of abode for you than that you have , when he return to . of how shall I bear all these exceed great and generous favour !-- I send they wrapt up , five guinea in a parcel , in double papers . to I he give no less than one hundred guinea more ; and say , I would have you , my dear , give Jewkes , when you go away from hence , what you think fit out of these , as from yourself . -- , good dear sir , say I , let that be what you please . give she , then , say he , twenty guinea , as a compliment on you nuptial . ten guinea give : the two coachman five guinea each ; to the two maid at this house five guinea each ; give five guinea ; give five guinea ; and give the gardener , grooms , and helper , twenty guinea among they . and when , say he , I return with you to the other house , I will make you a suitable present , to buy you such ornament as be fit for my beloved wife to appear in . for now , my , continue he , you be not to mind , as you once propose , what other lady will say ; but to appear as my wife ought to do . else it would look as if what you think of , as a means to avoid the envy of other of you sex , be a wilful slight in I , which , I hope , I never shall be guilty of ; and
and I will show the world , that I value you as I ink , and as if I have marry the first fortune in the kingdom : and why should it not be so , when I know none of the first quality that match you in excellence ? he see I be at a loss for word , and say , I see , my dearest bride ! my spouse ! my wife ! my Pamela ! you grateful confusion . and kiss I , as I be go to speak , I will stop you dear mouth , say he : you shall not so much as thank I ; for when I have do ten time more than this , I shall but poorly express my love for so much beauty of mind , and loveliness of person ; which thus , say he , and clasp I to he generous bosom , I can proudly now call my own !-- of how , my dear parent , can I think of any thing , but redouble love , joy , and gratitude ! and thus generously do he banish from my mind those painful reflection , and bashful apprehension , that make I dread to see he for the first time this day , when I be call to attend he at breakfast ; and make I all ease , composure , and tranquillity . he then , think I seem somewhat thoughtful , propose a little turn in the chariot till dinner - time : and this be another sweet relief to I ; and he divert I with twenty agreeable relation , of what observation he have make in he travels ; and give I the character of the ladie and gentleman in he other neighbourhood ; tell I whose acquaintance he would have I most cultivate . and when I mention Lady Davers with apprehension , he say , to be sure I love my sister dearly , notwithstand she violent spirit ; and I know she love I ; and I can allow a little for she pride , because I know what my own so lately be ; and because she know not my , and she excellency , as I do . but you must not , my dear , forget what belong to you character , as my wife , nor meanly stoop to she ; though I know you will choose , by softness , to try to move she to a proper behaviour . but it shall be my part to see , that you do not yield too much . however , continue he , as I would not publicly declare my marriage here , I hope she will not come near we till we be in ; and then , when she know we be marry , she will keep away , if she be not willing to be reconcile ; for she dare not , surly , come to quarrel with I , when she know it be do ; for that would have a hateful and wicked appearance , as if she would try to make difference between man and wife . -- but we will have no more of this subject , nor talk of any thing , add he , that shall give concern to my dearest . and so he change the talk to a more pleasing subject , and say the kindest and most soothing thing in the world . when we come home , which be about dinner - time , he be the same obliging , kind gentleman ; and , in short , be studious to show , on every occasion , he generous affection to I . and , after dinner , he tell I , he have already write to he draper , in town , to provide he new livery ; and to he late mother 's mercer , to send he down pattern of the most fashionable silk , for my choice . I tell he , I be unable to express my gratitude for he favour and generosity : and as he know best what befit he own rank and condition , I would wholly remit myself to he good pleasure . but , by all he repeat bounty to I , of so extraordinary a nature , I could not but look forward with awe upon the condition to which he have exalt I ; and now I fear I should hardly be able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the choice he have condescende to make : but that , I hope , I should have not only he generous allowance for my imperfection , which I could only assure he should not be wilful one , but he kind instruction ; and that as often as he observe any part of my conduct such as he could not entirely approve , he would let I know it ; and I would think he reproof of begin fault the kindest and most affectionate thing in the world because they would keep I from committing greater ; and be a means to continue to I the blessing of he good opinion . he answer I in the kindest manner ; and assure I , that nothing should ever lie upon he mind which he would not reveal , and give I a opportunity either of convince he , or be convince myself . he then ask I , when I should be willing to go to the house ? I say , whenever he please . we will come down hither again before the winter , say he , if you please , in order to cultivate the acquaintance you have begin with , and 's family ; and , if it please to spare we to one another , in the winter I
I will give you , as I promise for two or three month , the diversion of . and I think , add he , if my dear pleasis , we will set out next week , about , for t'other house . I can have no objection , sir , say I , to any thing you propose ; but how will you avoid 's solicitation for a evening to dance ? why , say he , we can make evening do for that purpose , if they will not excuse we . but , if you please , say he , I will invite , and he family , and and he family , to my little chapel , on morning , and to stay dinner with I ; and then I will declare my marriage to they , because my dear life shall not leave this country with the least reason for a possibility of any body 's doubt that it be so . o ! how good be this ! but , indeed , he conduct be all of a piece , noble , kind , and considerate ! what a happy creature be I !-- and then , may be , say he , they will excuse we till we return into this country again , as to the ball . be there any thing , add he , that my belov have still to wish ? if you have , freely speak . , my dearest sir , reply I , you have not only prevent my wish , but my hope , and even my thought . and yet I must own , since you kind command of speak my mind seem to show , that you expect from I I should say something ; that I have only one or two thing to wish more , and then I shall be too happy . , say he , what they be . , proceed I , I be , indeed , asham to ask any thing , lest it should not be agreeable to you ; and lest it should look as if I be take advantage of you kind condescension to I , and know not when to be satisfied ! I will only tell you , , say he , that you be not to imagine , that these thing , which I have do , in hope of oblige you , be the sudden impulse of a new passion for you . but , if I can answer for my own mind , they proceed from a regular and uniform desire of oblige you : which , I hope , will last as long as you merit last ; and that , I make no doubt , will be as long as I live . and I can the rather answer for this , because I really find so much delight in myself in my present way of think and act , as infinitely overpay I ; and which , for that reason , I be likely to continue , for both we sake . my beloved wife , therefore , say he , for methink I be grow fond of a name I once despise , may venture to speak she mind ; and I will promise , that , so far as it be agreeable to I , and I cheerfully can , I will comply ; and you will not insist upon it , if that should not be the case . to be sure , sir , say I , I ought not , neither will I . and now you embole I to become a humble petitioner , and that , as I ought , upon my knee , for the reinstating such of you servants , as I have be the unhappy occasion of they disoblige you . he raise I up , and say , my belov have too often be in this suppliant posture to I , to permit it any more . rise , my fairest , and let I know whom , in particular , you would reinstate ; and he kindly hold I in he arm , and press I to he beloved bosom . , , say I , in the first place ; for she be a good woman ; and the misfortune she have have in the world , must make you displeasure most heavy to she . well , say he , who next ? , , say I ; and I be sure , kind as they have be to I , yet would I not ask it , if I could not vouch for they integrity , and if I do not think it be my dear master 's interest to have such good servants . have you any thing further ? say he , say I , you good old butler , who have so long be in you family before the day of you happy birth , I would , if I might , become a advocate for ! well , say he , I have only to say , that have not and , and too , join in a body , in a bold appeal to , which have give she the insolent handle she have take to intermeddle in my affair , I could easily have forgiven all the rest of they conduct ; though they have give they tongue no little license about I : but I could have forgive they , because I desire every body should admire you ; and it be with pride that I observe not only they opinion and love , but that of every body else that know you , justify my own .-- but yet , I will forgive even this , because my desire it ; and I will send a letter myself , to tell what he owe
owe to you interposition , if the estate he have make in my family do not set he above the acceptance of it . and , as to , do you , my dear , write a letter to she , and give she you command , instantly , on , the receipt of it , to go and take possession of she former charge ; for now , my dearest girl , she will be more immediately you servant ; and I know you love she so well , that you will go thither with the more pleasure to find she there . -- but do not think , add he , that all this compliance be to be for nothing . ah , sir ! say I , tell I but what I can do , poor as I be in power , but rich in will ; and I will not hesitate one moment . why then , say he , of you own accord , reward I for my cheerful compliance , with one sweet kiss -- I instantly say , thus , then , dear sir , will I obey ; and , oh ! you have the sweetest and most generous way in the world , to make that a condition , which give I double honour , and add to my obligation . and so I clasp my arm about he neck , and be not asham to kiss he once and twice , and three time ; once for every forgiven person . now , my dearest , say he , what other thing have you to ask ? be already take care of ; and , I hope , will be happy .-- have you nothing to say for ? why , dear sir , say I , you have see the poor fellow 's penitence in my letter . -- yes , my dear , so I have ; but that be he penitence for he have serve I against you ; and , I think , when he would have betraye I afterwards , he deserve nothing to be say or do for he by either . but , dear sir , say I , this be a day of jubilee ; and the less he deserve , poor fellow , the more will be you goodness . and let I add one word ; that as he be divide in he inclination between he duty to you and good wish to I , and know not how to distinguish between the one and the other , when he find we so happily united by you great goodness to I , he will have no more puzzle in he duty ; for he have not fail in any other part of it ; but , I hope , will serve you faithfully for the future . well , then , suppose I put Jewke in a good way of business , in some inn , and give she for a husband ? and then you gipsy story will be make out , that she will have a husband younger than herself . you be all goodness , sir , say I . I can freely forgive poor , and wish she happy . but permit I , sir , to ask , would not this look like a very heavy punishment to poor ? and as if you could not forgive he , when you be so generous to every body else ? he smile and say , of my , this , for a forgive spirit , be very severe upon poor Jewke : but I shall never , by the grace of , have any more such trying service , to put he or the rest upon ; and if you can forgive he , I think I may : and so shall be at you disposal . and now let I know what my have further to wish ? o , my dearest sir , say I , not a single wish more have you grateful Pamela ! my heart be overwhelm with you goodness ! forgive these tear of joy , add I : you have leave I nothing to pray for , but that will bless you with life , and health , and honour , and continue to I the blessing of you esteem ; and I shall then be the happiest creature in the world . he clasp I in he arm , and say , you can not , my dear life , be so happy in I , as I be in you . of how heartily I despise all my former pursuit , and headstrong appetite ! what joy , what true joy , flow from virtuous love ! joy which the narrow soul of the libertine can not take in , nor he thought conceive ! and which I myself , whilst a libertine , have not the least notion of ! but , say he , I expect my dear spouse , my , have something to ask for herself . but since all she own good be absorb in the delight she generous heart take in promote that of other , it shall be my study to prevent she wish , and to make she care for herself unnecessary , by my anticipating kindness . in this manner , my dear parent , be you happy daughter bless in a husband ! of how my exult heart leap at the dear , dear word ! -- and I have nothing to do , but to be humble , and to look up with gratitude to the all - gracious dispenser of these blessing . so , with a thousand thanks , I afterwards retir to my closet , to write you thus far . and have complete what I purpose for this packet , and put up
up the kind oblige present , I have nothing more to say , but that I hope soon to see you both , and receive you blessing on this happy , thrice happy occasion . and so , hope for you prayer , that I may preserve a humble and upright mind to my gracious , a dutiful gratitude to my dear master and husband -- that I may long rejoice in the continuance of these blessing and favour , and that I may preserve , at the same time , a obliging deportment to every one else , I conclude myself , you ever- dutiful and most happy daughter , ---- o think it not my pride , my dear parent , that set I on glorying in my change of name ! yours will be always dear to I , and what I shall never be asham of , I be sure : but yet -- for such a husband ! -- what shall I say , since word be too faint to express my gratitude and my joy ! I have take copy of my master 's letter to , and mine to , which I will send with the further occurrence , when I go to the other dear house , or give you when I see you , as I now hope soon to do . morning , the third of my happy nuptial . I must still write on , till I come to be settle in the duty of the station to which I be so generously exalt , and to let you participate with I the transport pleasure that rise from my new condition , and the favour that be hourly heape upon I by the best of husband . when I have get my packet for you finish , I then set about writing , as he have kindly direct I , to ; and have no difficulty till I come to sign my name ; and so I bring it down with I , when I be call to supper , unsigned . my good master ( for I delight , and always shall , to call he by that name ) have be write to ; and he say , pleasantly , see , here , my dearest , what I have write to you somebody . I read as follow : ' , 'I have the pleasure to acquaint you , that last I be marry to my beloved . I have have reason to be disoblige with you , and and , not for you kindness to , and regard for , my dear spouse , that now be , but for the manner , in which you appeal to my sister Davers ; which have make a very wide breach between she and I . but as it be one of she first request , that I would overlook what have pass , and reinstate you in all you former charge , I think myself oblige , without the least hesitation , to comply with it . so , if you please , you may enter again upon a office which you have always execute with unquestionable integrity , and to the satisfaction of ' yours etc. ' ' afternoon . ' 'I shall set out next or for ; and desire to find , as well as you , in you former office ; in which , I dare say , you will have the more pleasure , as you have such a early instance of the sentiment of my dear wife , from whose goodness you may expect every agreeable thing . she write herself to . ' I thank he most gratefully for he goodness ; and afterwards take the above copy of it ; and shew he my letter to , as follow : ' my . , 'I have joyful tiding to communicate to you . for yesterday I be happily marry to the best of gentleman , yours and my beloved master . I have only now to tell you , that I be inexpressibly happy : that my generous benefactor deny I nothing , and even anticipate my wish . you may be sure I could not forget my dear ; and I make it my request , and have it grant , as soon as ask , that you might return to the kind charge , which you execute with so much advantage to we master 's interest , and so much pleasure to all under you direction . all the power that be put into my hand , by the most generous of man , shall be exert to make every thing easy and agreeable to you : and as I shall soon have the honour of attending my belov to , it will be a very considerable addition to my delight , and to my unspeakable obligation to the best of man , to see my dear , and to be receive by she with that pleasure , which I promise myself from she affection . for I be , my dear good friend , and always will be , ' , very affectionately , and gratefully , ----. ' he read this letter , and say , ' , my dear , and must be good : but do not you put you name to it ? , say I , you goodness have give I a right to a very honourable one but as this be the first occasion of the kind , except that to my dear father and mother , I think I ought to show it you unsign , that I may not seem over -forward to take advantage of the honour you have do I . however sweetly humble and requisite , say he , this may appear to my dear 's niceness , it befit I to tell you ,
, that I be every moment more and more pleased with the right you have to my name : and , my dear life , add he , I have only to wish I may be half as worthy as you be of the happy knot so lately knit . he then take a pen himself , and write , after , he most worthy sirname ; and I under - write thus : 'o rejoice with I , my dear , that I be enable , by 's graciousness , and my dear master 's goodness , thus to write myself ! ' these letter , and the packet to you , be send away by early this morning . my dearest master be just go to take a ride out , and intend to call upon , , and , to invite they to chapel and dinner to - morrow ; and say , he choose to do it himself , because the time be so short , they will , perhaps , deny a servant . I forget to mention , that be here yesterday , to ask leave to go to see he new living , and to provide for take possession of it ; and see so pleased with my master 's kindness and fondness for I , as well as he generous deportment to himself , that he leave we in such a disposition , as shew he be quite happy . I be very glad of it ; for it would rejoice I to be a humble means of make all mankind so : and oh ! what return ought I not to make to the divine goodness ! and how ought I to strive to diffuse the blessing I experience , to all in my knowledge ! -- for else , what be it for such a worm as I to be exalt ! what be my single happiness , if I suffer it , niggard - like , to extend no farther than to myself ? -- but then , indeed , do 's creature act worthy of the blessing they receive , when they make , or endeavou to make , the whole creation , so far as be in the circle of they power , happy ! great and good ! as thou hast enlarge my opportunity , enlarge also my will , and make I delight in dispense to other a portion of that happiness , which I have myself so plentifully receive at the hand of thy gracious Providence ! then shall I not be useless in my generation !-- then shall I not stand a single mark of thy goodness to a poor worthless creature , that in herself be of so small account in the scale of being , a mere cipher on the wrong side of a figure ; but shall be place on the right side ; and , though nothing worth in myself , shall give signification by my place , and multiply the blessing I owe to thy goodness , which have distinguished I by so fair a lot ! this , as I conceive , be the indispensable duty of a high condition ; and how great must be the condemnation of poor creature , at the great day of account , when they shall be ask , what use they have make of the opportunity put into they hand ? and be able only to say , we have liv but to ourselve : we have circumscribe all the power thou hast give we into one narrow , selfish , compass : we have heape up treasure for those who come after we , though we know not whether they would not make a still worse use of they than we ourselves do ! and how can such poor selfish pleader expect any other sentence , than the dreadful , , ye curse ! but sure , my dear father and mother , such person can have no notion of the exalted pleasure that flow from do good , were there to be no after -account at all ! there be something so satisfactory and pleasing to reflect on the be able to administer comfort and relief to those who stand in need of it , as infinitely , of itself , reward the beneficent mind . and how often have I experience this in my good lady 's time , though but the second - hand dispenser of she benefit to the poor and sickly , when she make I she almoner !-- how have I be affect with the blessing which the miserable have heape upon she for she goodness , and upon I for be but the humble conveyer of she bounty to they ! -- and how delighted have I be , when the move report I have make of a particular distress , have augment my good lady 's first intention in relief of it ! this I recall with pleasure , because it be now , by the divine goodness , become my part to do those good thing she be will nt to do : and oh ! let I watch myself , that my prosperous state do not make I forget to look up , with due thankfulness , to the Providence which have entrust I with the power , that so I may not incur a terrible woe by the abuse or neglect of it ! forgive I these reflection , my dear parent ; and let I have you prayer , that I may not find my present happiness a snare to I ; but that I may consider , that more and more will be expect from I , in proportion to the power give I ; and that I may not so unworthily act , as if I believe I ought to set up my rest in my
my mean self , and think nothing further to be do , with the opportunity put into my hand , by the divine favour , and the best of man ! , seven o'clock in the evening . my master return home to dinner , in compliment to I , though much presse to dine with , as he be , also , by , to dine with he . but could not conveniently provide a preacher for he own church tomorrow morning , at so short a notice ; be gone , as I say , to he new living ; but believe he could for the afternoon ; and so he promise to give we he company to dinner , and to read afternoon service : and this make my master invite all the rest , as well as he , to dinner , and not to church ; and he make they promise to come ; and tell , he would send he coach for he and he family . tell he pleasantly , she would not come , unless he would promise to let she be at he wedding ; by which i find have keep the secret , as my master desire . he be pleased to give I a airing after dinner in the chariot , and renew he kind assurance to I , and , if possible , be kinder than ever . this be sweetly comfortable to I , because it shew I he do not repent of he condescension to I ; and it encourage I to look up to he with more satisfaction of mind , and less doubtfulness . I beg leave to send a guinea to a poor body in the town , that I hear , by , lay very ill , and be very destitute . he say , send two , my dear , if you please . say I , , I will never do any thing of this kind without let you know what i do . he must generously answer , I shall then , perhaps , have you do less good than you would otherwise do , from a doubt of I ; though , I hope , you discretion , and my own temper , which be not avaricious , will make such doubt causeless . now , my dear , continue he , I will tell you how we will order this point , to avoid even the shadow of uneasiness on one side , or doubt on the other . as to you father and mother , in the first place , they shall be quite out of the question ; for I have already determine in my mind about they ; and it be thus : they shall go down , if they and you think well of it , to my little Kentish estate ; which I once mention to you in such a manner , as make you reject it with a nobleness of mind , that give I pain then , but pleasure since . there be a pretty little farm , and house , untenant , upon that estate , and tolerably well stock , and I will further stock it for they ; for such industrious folk will not know how to live without some employment ; and it shall be theirs for both they life , without pay any rent ; and I will allow they 50 l . per annum besides , that they may keep up the stock , and be kind to any other of they relation , without be beholden to you or I for small matter ; and for greater , where needful , you shall always have it in you power to accommodate they ; for I shall never question you prudence . and we will , so long as spare we life , go down , once a year , to see they ; and they shall come up , as often as they please , it can not be too often , to see we : for I mean not this , my dear , to send they from we .-- before I proceed , do my like this ? o , sir , say I , the english tongue affords not word , or , at least , I have they not , to express sufficiently my gratitude ! teach I , dear sir , continue I , and press he dear hand to my lip , teach I some other language , if there be any , that abound with more grateful term ; that I may not thus be chok with meaning , for which I can find no utterance . my charmer ! say he , you language be all wonderful , as you sentiment ; and you most abound , when you seem most to want !-- all that I wish , be to find my proposal agreeable to you ; and if my first be not , my second shall be , if I can but know what you wish . do I say too much , my dearest parent , when I say , he be , if possible , kinder and kinder ?--o the bless man ! how my heart be overwhelm with he goodness ! well , say he , my dearest , let I desire you to mention this to they , to see if they approve it . but , if it be you choice , and theirs , to have they nearer to you , or even under the same roof with you , I will freely consent to it . of no , sir , say I , ( and I fear almost sinned in my grateful flight , ) I be sure they would not choose that ; they could not , perhaps , serve so well if they be
be to live with you : for , so constantly see the hand that bless they , they would , it may be , as must be my care to avoid , be temp to look no further in they gratitude , than to the dear dispenser of such innumerable benefit . excellent creature ! say he : my belove want no language , nor sentiment neither ; and she charme thought , so sweetly express , would grase any language ; and this be a blessing almost peculiar to my fairest .-- you so kind acceptance , my , add he , repay the benefit with interest , and leave I under obligation to you goodness . but now , my dearest , I will tell you what we will do , with regard to point of you own private charity ; for far be it from I , to put under that name the subject we have be mention ; because that , and more than that , be duty to person so worthy , and so nearly related to my , and , as such , to myself .-- of how the sweet man outdo I , in thought , word , power , and every thing ! and this , say he , lie in very small compass ; for I will allow you two hundred pound a year , which Longman shall constantly pay you , at fifty pound a quarter , for you own use , and of which I expect no account ; to commence from the day you enter into my other house : I mean , say he , that the first fifty pound shall then be due ; because you shall have something to begin with . and , add the dear generous man , if this be pleasing to you , let it , since you say you want word , be signify by such a sweet kiss as you give I yesterday . I hesitate not a moment to comply with these obliging term , and throw my arm about he dear neck , though in the chariot , and bless he goodness to I . but , indeed , sir , say I , I can not bear this generous treatment ! he be pleased to say , do not be uneasy , my dear , about these trifle : have bless I with a very good estate , and all of it in a prosperous condition , and generally well tenant . I lay up money every year , and have , besides , large sum in government and other security ; so that you will find , what I have hithertoo promise , be very short of that proportion of my substance , which , as my dearest wife , you have a right to . in this sweet manner do we pass we time till evening , when the chariot bring we home ; and then we supper succeed in the same agreeable manner . and thus , in a rapturous circle , the time move on ; every hour bring with it something more delightful than the past ! -- sure nobody be ever so blest as I ! , the fourth day of my happiness . not go to chapel this morning , the reason of which I tell you , I bestow the time , from the hour of my beloved 's rise , to breakfast , in prayer and thanksgive , in my closet ; and now I begin to be quite easy , cheerful , and free in my spirit ; and the rather , as I find myself encourage by the tranquillity , and pleasing vivacity , in the temper and behaviour of my beloved , who thereby shew he do not repent of he goodness to I . I attend he to breakfast with great pleasure and freedom , and he seem quite pleased with I , and say , now do my dearest begin to look upon I with a air of serenity and satisfaction : it shall be always , add he , my delight to give you occasion for this sweet become aspect of confidence and pleasure in I .-- my heart , dear sir , say I , be quite easy , and have lose all its foolish tumult , which , combat with my gratitude , might give a unacceptable appearance to my behaviour : but now you goodness , sir , have enable it to get the better of its uneasy apprehension , and my heart be all of one piece , and devote to you , and grateful tranquillity . and could I be so happy as to see you and my good Lady Daver reconcile , I have nothing in this world to wish for more , but the continuance of you favour . he say , I wish this reconciliation , my dearest , as well as you : and I do assure you , more for you sake than my own ; and if she would behave tolerably , I would make the term easier to she , for that reason . he say , I will lay down one rule for you , my , to observe in you dress ; and I will tell you every thing I like or dislike , as it occur to I : and I would have you do the same , on you part ; that nothing may be upon either of we minds that may occasion the least reservedness . I have often observ , in married folk , that , in a little while , the lady grow careless in she dress ; which , to I , look as if she would take no pain to secure the affection she have gain ; and shew a slight to she husband , that she have not to she
she lover . now , you must know , this have always give I great offence ; and I should not forgive it , even in my Pamela : though she would have this excuse for herself , that thousand could not make , that she look lovely in every thing . so , my dear , I shall expect of you always to be dress by dinner - time , except something extraordinary happen ; and this , whether you be to go abroad , or stay at home . for this , my love , will continue to you that sweet ease in you dress and behaviour , which you be so happy a mistress of ; and whomsoever I bring home with I to my table , you will be in readiness to receive they ; and will not want to make those foolish apology to unexpect visitor , that carry with they a reflection on the conduct of those who make they ; and , besides , will convince I , that you think yourself oblige to appear as graceful to you husband , as you would to person less familiar to you sight . this , dear sir , say I , be a most obliging injunction ; and I must heartily thank you for it , and will always take care to obey it .-- why , my dear , say he , you may better do this than half you sex ; because they too generally act in such a manner , as if they seem to think it the privilege of birth and fortune , to turn day into night , and night into day , and be seldom stirr till it be time to sit down to dinner ; and so all the good old family rule be reverse : for they breakfast , when they should dine ; dine , when they should sup ; and sup , when they should go to bed ; and , by the help of dear quadrille , sometimes go to be when they should rise .-- in all thing but these , my dear , continue he , I expect you to be a lady . and my good mother be one of this oldfashioned cut , and , in all other respects , as worthy a lady as any in the kingdom . and so you have not be use to the new way , and may the easier practise the other . dear sir , say I , pray give I more of you sweet injunction . why then , continue he , I shall , in the usual course , and generally , if not hinder by company , like to go to be with my dearest by eleven ; and , if I do not , sha not hinder you . I ordinarily now rise by six in summer . I will allow you to be half a hour after I , or so . then you will have some time you may call you own , till you give I you company to breakfast ; which may be always so , as that we may have do at a little after nine . then will you have several hour again at you disposal , till two o'clock , when I shall like to sit down at table . you will then have several useful hour more to employ yourself in , as you shall best like ; and I would generally go to supper by eight ; and when we be resolve to stick to these oldfashioned rule , as near as we can , we shall have we visitor conform to they too , and expect they from we , and suit themselves accordingly : for I have always observ , that it be in every one 's power to prescribe rule to himself . it be only stand a few ridiculous jest at first , and that too from such , generally , as be not the most worthy to be mind ; and , after a while , they will say , it signify nothing to ask he : he will have he own way . there be no put he out of he bia . he be a regular piece of clock - work , they will joke , and all that : and why , my dear , should we not be so ? for man be as frail a piece of machinery as any clock - work whatever ; and , by irregularity , be as subject to be disorder . then , my dear , continue the charming man , when they see they be receive , at my own time , with a open countenance and cheerful heart ; when they see plenty and variety at my board , and meet a kind and hearty welcome from we both ; they will not offer to break in upon my condition , nor grudge I my regular hour : and as most of these people have nothing to do , except to rise in a morning , they may as well come to breakfast with we at half a hour after eight , in summer , as at ten or eleven ; to dinner at two , as at four , five , or six ; and to supper at eight , as at ten or eleven . and then we servant , too , will know , generally , the time of they business , and the hour of they leisure or recess ; and we , as well as they , shall reap the benefit of this regularity . and who know , my dear , but we may revive the good oldfashion in we neighbourhood , by this mean ?-- at least it will be do we part towards it ; and answer the good lesson I learn at
at school , every one mend one . and the worst that will happen will be , that when some of my brother rake , such as those who break in upon we , so unwelcomely , last , be get out of the way , if that can ever be , and begin to consider who they shall go to dine with in they ramble , they will only say , we must not go to he , for he dinner - time be over ; and so they will reserve I for another time , when they happen to suit it better ; or , perhaps , they will take a supper and a bed with I instead of it . now , my dearest , continue the kind man , you see here be more of my injunction , as you call they ; and though I will not be so set , as to quarrel , if they be not always exactly comply with ; yet , as I know you will not think they unreasonable , I shall be glad they may , as often as they can ; and you will give you order accordingly to you , who be a good woman , and will take pleasure in obey you . of dearest , dear sir , say I , have you nothing more to honour I with ? you oblige and improve I at the same time .-- what a happy lot be mine ! why , let I see , my dearest , say he -- but I think of no more at present : for it would be needless to say how much I value you for you natural sweetness of temper , and that open cheerfulness of countenance , which adorn you , when nothing have give my fairest apprehension for she virtue : a sweetness , and a cheerfulness , that prepossess in you favour , at first sight , the mind of every one that behold you .-- I need not , I hope , say , that I would have you diligently preserve this sweet appearance : let no thwart accident , no cross fortune , ( for we must not expect to be exempt from such , happy as we now be in each other ! ) deprive this sweet face of this its principal grace : and when any thing unpleasing happen , in a quarter of a hour , at farthest , begin to mistrust yourself , and apply to you glass ; and if you see a gloom arise , or arisen , banish it instantly ; smooth you dear countenance ; resume you former composure ; and then , my dearest , whose heart must always be see in she face , and can not be a hypocrite , will find this a means to smooth she passion also : and if the occasion be too strong for so sudden a conquest , she will know how to do it more effectually , by repair to she closet , and begge that gracious assistance , which have never yet fail she : and so shall I , my dear , who , as you once but too justly observed , have be too much indulge by my good mother , have a example from you , as well as a pleasure in you , which will never be pal . one thing , continue he , I have frequently observe at the house of many a gentleman , that when we have unexpectedly visit , or break in upon the family order lay down by the lady ; and especially if any of we have lain under the suspicion of have occasionally seduce we marry companion into bad hour , or give indifferent example , the poor gentleman have be oddly affect at we come ; though the good breeding of the lady have make she just keep up appearances . he have look so conscious ; have be so afraid , as it be , to disoblige ; have make so many excuse for some of we , before we have be accuse , as have always shew I how unwelcome we have be ; and how much he be oblige to compound with he lady for a tolerable reception of we ; and , perhaps , she too , in proportion to the honest man 's concern to court she smile , have be more reserve , stiff , and formal ; and have behave with a indifference and slight that have often make I wish myself out of she house ; for too plainly have I see that it be not he . this , my dear , you will judge , by my description , have afforde I subject for animadversion upon the married life ; for a man may not ( though , in the main , he be willing to flatter himself that he be master of he house , and will assert he prerogative upon great occasion , when it be strongly invade ) be always willing to contend ; and such woman as those I have describe , be always ready to take the field , and be worse enemie than the old , who annoy most when they seem to retreat ; and never fail to return to the charge again , and carry on the offensive war , till they have ti out resistance , and make the husband willing , like a vanquished enemy , to compound for small matter , in order to preserve something . at least the poor man do not care to let he friend see he case ; and so will not provoke a fire to break out , that he see ( and so do he friend too ) the meek lady have much ado to smother ; and which , very possibly , burn
burn with a most comfortable ardour , after we be gone . you smile , my , say he , at this whimsical picture ; and , I be sure , I never shall have reason to include you in these disagreeable outline ; but yet I will say , that I expect from you , whoever come to my house , that you accustom yourself to one even , uniform complaisance : that no frown take place on you brow : that however ill or well provide we may be for they reception , you show no flutter or discomposure : that whoever you may have in you company at the time , you signify not , by the least reserve look , that the stranger be come upon you unseasonably , or at a time you wish he have not . but be facetious , kind , oblige to all ; and , if to one more than another , to such as have the least reason to expect it from you , or who be most inferior at the table ; for thus will you , my , cheer the doubting mind , quiet the uneasy heart , and diffuse ease , pleasure , and tranquillity , around my board . and be sure , my dear , continue he , let no little accident ruffle you temper . I shall never forget once that I be at 's ; and a footman happen to stumble , and let fall a fine china dish , and break it all to piece : it be grievous to see the uneasiness it give the poor lady : and she be so sincere in it , that she suffer it to spread all over the company ; and it be a pretty large one too ; and not a person in it but turn either she consoler , or fall into story of the like misfortune ; and so we all become , for the rest of the evening , nothing but blunder footman , and careless servants , or be turn into broken jar , plate , glass , tea-cup , and such like britle substance . and it affec I so much , that , when I come home , I go to bed , and dreamt , that , with the handle of he whip , break the fore glass of my chariot ; and I be so solicitous , methotch , to keep the good lady in countenance for she anger , that I break he head in revenge , and stab one of my coach - horse . and all the comfort I have when it be done , methotch , be , that I have not expose myself before company ; and there be no sufferer , but guilty , and one innocent coach - horse . I be exceedingly divert with the facetious hint , and the pleasant manner in which he give they ; and I promise to improve by the excellent lesson contain in they . I then go up and dress myself , as like a bride as I could , in my best clothes ; and , on inquiry , hear my dearest master be go to walk in the garden , I go to find he out . he be read in the little alcove ; and I say , , be I license to intrude upon you ?-- no , my dear , say he , because you can not intrude . I be so wholly yours , that , wherever I be , you have not onlly a right to join I , but you do I a very acceptable favour at the same time . I have , sy , say I , obey you first kind injunction , as to dress myself before dinner ; but may be you be busy , sir . he put up the papers he be read , and say , I can have no business or pleasure of equal value to you company , my dear . what be you go to say ?-- only , sir , to know if you have any more kind injunction to give I ?-- I could hear you talk a whole day together .-- you be very obliging , , say he ; but you be so perfectly what I wish , that I might have spare those I give you ; but I be willing you should have a taste of my freedom with you , to put you upon the like with I : for I be confident there can be no friendship last , without freedom , and without communicate to one another even the little caprice , if my can have any such , which may occasion uneasiness to either . now , my dear , say he , be so kind as to find some fault with I , and tell I what you would wish I to do , to appear more agreeable to you . of sir , say I , and I could have kiss he , but for shame , ( to be sure I shall grow a sad fond hussy , ) I have not one single thing to wish for ; no , not one !-- he salute I very kindly , and say , he should be sorry if I have , and forbore to speak it . do you think , my dear sir , say I , that you have no conscience ? do you think , that because you so kindly oblige she , and delight in oblige she , that she must rack she invention for trial of you goodness , and know not when she be happy ?--o my dearest sir , add I , less than one half of the favour you have so generously confer upon I , would have exceed my utmost
utmost wish ! my dear angel , say he , and kiss I again , I shall be troublesome to you with my kiss , if you continue thus sweetly oblige in you action and expression . of sir , say I , I have be think , as I be dress myself , what excellent lesson you teach I ! when you command I , at you table to cheer the doubting mind and comfort the uneasy heart , and to behave most kindly to those who have least reason to expect it , and be most inferior ; how sweetly , in every instance that could possibly occur , have you do this yourself by you poor , unworthy , till you have diffuse , in you own dear word , ease , pleasure , and tranquillity , around my glad heart ! then again , sir , when you bid I not be disturb by little accident , or by stranger come in upon I unexpectedly , how noble a instance do you give I of this , when , on we happy wedding - day , the coming of , and the other two gentleman , ( for which you be quite unprovided , and which hinder we happiness of dining together on that chosen day , ) do not so disturb you , but that you entertaine the gentleman pleasantly , and part with they civilly and kindly ! what charming instance be these , I have be recollect with pleasure , of you pursue the doctrine you deliver . my dear , say he , these observation be very kind in you , and much to my advantage : but if I do not always ( for I fear these be too much accident ) so well pursue the doctrine I lay down , my must not expect that my imperfection will be a plea for she nonobservance of my lesson , as you call they ; for , I doubt I shall never be half so perfect as you ; and so I can not permit you to recede in you goodness , though I may find myself unable to advance as I ought in my duty . I hope , sy , say I , by 's , I never shall . I believe it , say he ; but I only mention this , know my own defect , lest my future lesson should not be so well warrant by my practice , as in the instance you have kindly recollect . he be pleased to take notice of my dress ; and spann my waist with he hand , say , what a sweet shape be here ! it would make one regret to lose it ; and yet , my belov , I shall think nothing but that loss want , to complete my happiness .-- I put my bold hand before he mouth , and say , Hush , hush ! of fie , sir !-- the freest thing you have ever yet say , since I have be yours !-- he kiss my hand , and say , such a innocent wish , my dearest , may be permit I , because it be the end of the institution . -- but say , would such a case be unwelcome to my ?-- I will say , sy , say I , and hide my blushing face on he bosom , that you wish , in every thing , shall be mine ; but , pray , sir , say no more . he kindly salute I , and thanke I , and change the subject .-- I be not too free , I hope . thus we talk , till we hear the coach ; and then he say , stay here , in the garden , my dear , and I will bring the company to you . and when he be gone , I pass by the back - door , knee down against it , and bless for not permit my then so much desire escape . I go to the pond , and knee down on the mossy bank , and again blesse there , for he mercy in my escape from myself , my the worst enemy , though I think I have none but enemy , and no friend near I . and so I ought to do in almost every step of this garden , and every room in this house !-- and I be bend my step to the dear little chapel , to make my acknowledgment there ; but I see the company come towards I . say , so , , how do you do now ? o , you look so easy , so sweetly , so pleased , that I know you will let I dance at you wedding , for I shall long to be there ! be pleased to say I look like a angel : and say , I improve upon they every time they see I . be also pleased to make I a fine compliment , and say , I look freer and easier every time she see I . dear heart ! I wish , think I , you would spare these compliment ; for I shall have some joke , I doubt , pass on I by - and - by , that will make I suffer for all these fine thing . say , softly , bless you , dear daughter ! -- but not so much as my wife know it . -- come in last , and take I by the hand , and say , ----, by you leave ; and kiss my hand five or six time , as if he be mad ; and hold it with both he , and make a very free jest , by way of compliment ,
, in he way . well , I think a young rake be hardly tolerable ; but a old rake , and a old beau , be two very sad thing !-- and all this before daughter , woman - grow !-- I whisper my dearest , a little after , and say , I fear I shall suffer much from 's rude joke , by - and - by , when you reveal the matter t.--'Tis he way , my dear , say he ; you must now grow above these thing .-- say to I , with a sort of half grave , ironical air ,-- well , , if I may judge by you easy deportment now , to what it be when I see you last , I hope you will let my sister , if you will n't I , see the happy knot tie ! for she be quite wild about it .-- I courtesy , and only say , you be all very good to I , lady .-- 's niece say , well , , I hope , before we part , we shall be tell the happy day . my good master hear she , and say , you shall , you shall , madam .-- that be pure , say . he take I aside , and say softly , shall I lead they to the alcove , and tell they there , or stay till we go in to dinner ?-- neither , sir , I think , say I , I fear I sha not stand it .-- , say he , they must know it ; I would not have invite they else .-- why then , sir , say I , let it alone till they be go away .-- then , reply he , you must pull off you ring . no , no , sir , say I , that I must not .-- well , say he , do you tell of it yourself .-- indeed , sir , answer I , I cannot . come officiously to ask my master , just then , if she should bring a glass of rhenish and sugar before dinner , for the gentleman and lady : and he say , that be well think of ; bring it , . and she come , with attend she , with two bottle and glass , and a salver ; and must need , make a low courtesy , offer first to I ; say , will you ladyship begin ? I colou like scarlet , and say , no ;--my master , to be sure ! but they all take the hint ; and say , I will be hang if they have not steal a wedding ! say , it must certainly be so ! ah ! . I will assure you , say he , I have not marry they . where be you , say she , and , last morning ? say , let I alone , let I alone ; if any thing have be steal , I will find it out ! I be a justice of the peace , you know . and so he take I by the hand , and say , come , madam , answer I , by the oath you have take : be you marry or not ? my master smile , to see I look so like a fool ; and I say , , !-- ay , ay , say he ; I think you do not look so smirk upon we for nothing .-- well , then , , say my master , since you blush discover you , do not be asham , but confess the truth ! now , say , I be quite angry ; and , say , I be quite pleased ; let I give you joy , dear madam , if it be so . and so they all say , and salute I all round .-- I be vex it be before Jewkes ; for she shake she fat side , and see highly pleased to be a means of discover it . nobody , say my master , wish I joy . no , say , very obligingly , nobody need ; for , with such a peerless spouse , you want no good wish :-- and he salute they ; and when he come last to I , say , before they all , now , my sweet bride , my , let I conclude with you ; for here I begin to love , and here I desire to end loving , but not till my life end . this be sweetly say , and take great notice of ; and it be do credit to he own generous choice , and vastly more than I merit . but I be force to stand many more joke afterwards : for say , several time , come , come , madam , now you be become one of we , I shall be a little less scrupulous than I have be , I will assure you . when we come in to dinner , I make no difficulty of what all offer I , the upper end of the table ; and perform the honour of it with pretty tolerable presence of mind , consider . and , with much ado , my good benefactor promise to be down again before winter , we get off the ball ; but appoint evening , at 's , to take leave of all this good company , who promise to be there , my master design to set out on morning for . we have prayer in the little chapel , in the afternoon ; but they all wish for the good clerk again , with great encomium upon you , my dear father
father ; and the company stay supper also , and depart exceed well satisfied , and with abundance of wish for the continuance of we mutual happiness ; and my master desire to answer for he to the ringer at the town , if they should hear of it ; till we return into this country ; and that then he would be bountiful to they , because he would not publicly declare it till he have first do so in . , the fifth day . I have have very little of my dear friend 's company this day ; for he only stay breakfast with I , and ride out to see a sick gentleman about eighteen mile off , who beg ( by a man and horse on purpose ) to speak with he , believe he should not recover , and upon part of whose estate my master have a mortgage . he say , my dearest , I shall be very uneasy , if I be oblige to tarry all night from you ; but , lest you should be alarme , if I do not come home by ten , do not expect I : for poor and I have pretty large concern together ; and if he should be very ill , and would be comfort by my presence , ( as I know he love I , and he family will be more in my power , if he die , than I wish for , ) charity will not let I refuse . it be now ten o'clock at night , and I fear he will not return . I fear , for the sake of he poor sick friend , who , I doubt , be worse . though I know not the gentleman , I be sorry for he own sake , for he family 's sake , and for my dear master 's sake , who , by he kind expression , I find , love he : and , methink , I should be sorry any grief should touch he generous heart ; though yet there be no living in this world , without too many occasion for concern , even in the most prosperous state . and it be fit it should be so ; or else , poor wretch , as we be ! we should look no farther , but be like sensual traveller on a journey homeward , who , meet with good entertainment at some inn on the way , put up they rest there , and never think of pursue they journey to they proper home .-- this , I remember , be often a reflection of my good lady 's , to whom I owe it . eleven o'clock . have be with I , and ask if I will have she for a bed - fellow , in want of a better ? I thank she ; but I say , I would see how it be to be by myself one night . I might have mention , that i make dine and sup with I ; and she be much pleased with it , and my behaviour to she . and I could see , by she manner , that she be a little struck inwardly at some of she former conduct to I . but , poor wretch ! it be much , I fear , because I be what I be ; for she have otherwise very little remorse , I doubt . she talk and action be entirely different from what they use to be , quite circumspect and decent ; and I should have think she virtuous , and even pious , have I never know she in another light . by this we may see , my dear father and mother , of what force example be , and what be in the power of the head of family to do : and this shew , that evil example , in superior , be doubly pernicious , and doubly culpable , because such person be bad themselves , and not only do no good , but much harm to other ; and the condemnation of such must , to be sure , be so much the greater ! -- and how much the greater still must my condemnation be , who have have such a religious education under you , and be so well nurture by my good lady , if I should forget , with all these mercy heape upon I , what belong to the station I be prefer to !--o how I long to be do some good ! for all that be past yet , be my dear , dear master 's , bless he ! and return he safe to my wish ! for methink , already , ' ttis a week since I see he . if my love would not be troublesome and impertinent , I should be nothing else ; for I have a true grateful spirit ; and I have need to have such a one , for I be poor in every thing but will . morning , eleven o'clock . my dear , dear -- master ( I be sure I should still say ; but I will learn to rise to a softer epithet , now - and - then ) be not yet come . I hope he be safe and well !-- so and I go to breakfast . but I can do nothing but talk and think of he , and all he kindness to I , and to you , which be still I , more intimately !-- I have just receive a letter from he , which he write overnight , as I find by it , and send early this morning . this be a copy of it . to . , night . 'I
'I hope my not come home this night will not frighten you . you may believe I can not help it . my poor friend be so very ill , that I doubt he can not recover . he desire to have I stay with he be so strong , that I shall sit up all night with he , as it be now near one o'clock in the morning ; for he can not bear I out of he sight : and I have make he and he distressed wife and child so easy , in the kindest assurance I could give he of my consideration for he and they , that I be look upon ( as the poor disconsolate widow , as she , I doubt , will soon be , tell I , ) as they good angel . I could have wish we have not engage to the good neighbourhood at 's for to - morrow night ; but I be so desirous to set out on for the other house , that , as well as in return for the civility of so many good friend , who will be there on purpose , I would not put it off . what I beg of you , therefore , my dear , be , that you would go in the chariot to 's , the sooner in the day the better , because you will be divert with the company , who all so much admire you ; and I hope to join you there by you tea - time in the afternoon , which will be better than go home , and return with you , as it will be six mile difference to I ; and I know the good company will excuse my dress , on the occasion . I count every hour of this little absence for a day : for I be , with the utmost sincerity , ' my dearest love , for ever yours , etc . ' ' if you could go to dine with they , it will be a freedom that would be very pleasing to they ; and the more , as they do not expect it . ' I begin to have a little concern , lest he fatigue should be too great , and for the poor sick gentleman and family ; but tell , that the least intimation of he choice should be a command to I , and so I would go to dinner there ; and order the chariot to be get ready to carry I : when a messenger come up , just as I be dress , to tell she she must come down immediately . I see at the window , that visitor be come ; for there be a chariot and six horse , the company go out of it , and three footman on horseback ; and I think the chariot have coronet . who can it be , I wonder ? --but here I will stop , for I suppose I shall soon know . good sir ! how unlucky this be ! what shall I do !-- here be Lady Davers come , she own self ! and my kind protector a great , great many mile off ! -- . , out of breath , come and tell I this , and say , she be inquire for my master and I . she ask she , it seem , naughty lady as she be , if I be who yet ! there be a word for a lady 's mouth ! say , she know not what to answer . and my lady say , she be not marry , I hope ? and say she , I say , no : because you have not own it yet publicly . my lady say , that be well enough . say I , I will run away , Jewkes ; and let the chariot go to the bottom of the elm - walk , and I will steal out of the door unperceive : but she be inquire for you , madam , reply she , and I say you be within , but go out ; and she say , she would see you presently , as soon as she could have patience . what do she call I ? say I . the creature , madam ; I will see the creature , say she , as soon as I can have patience . ay , but , say I , the creature will not let she , if she can help it . , , favour my escape , for this once ; for I be sadly frighted . -- she , I will bid the chariot go down , as you order , and wait till you come ; and I will step down and shut the hall door , that you may pass unobserved ; for she sits cool herself in the parlour , over against the staircase . that be a good ! say I : but who have she with she ? she woman , answer she , and she nephew ; but he come on horseback , and be go into the stable ; and they have three footman .-- and I wish , say I , they be all three hundred mile off !-- what shall I do ?-- so I write thus far , and wait impatiently to hear the coast be clear . tell I I must come down , or she will come up . what do she call I now ? say I . , madam , bid the wench come down to I . and she nephew and she woman be with she . say I , I can not go , and that be enough !-- you might contrive it that I might get out
out , if you would .-- indeed , madam , say she , I can not ; for I go to shut the door , and she bid I let it stand open ; and there she sit over against the staircase . then , say I , I will get out of the window , I think !--( and fan myself ; ) for I be sadly frightene . , , say she , I wonder you so much disturb yourself ! -- you be on the right side the hedge , I be sure ; and I would not be so discompose for any body . ay , say I , but who can help constitution ? I dare say you would no more be so discomposed , that I can help it . -- she , indeed , madam , if it be to I , I would put on a air as mistress of the house , as you be , and go and salute she ladyship , and bid she welcome . ay , ay , reply I , fine talking ! -- but how unlucky this be , you good master be not at home ! what answer shall I give she , say she , to she desiring to see you ?-- tell she , say I , I be sick a - bed ; I be die , and must not be disturb ; I be go out -- or any thing . but she woman come up to I just as I have utter this , and say , how do you do , ? my lady desire to speak to you . so I must go .-- sure she will not beat I !-- oh that my dear protector be at home ! well , now I will tell you all that happen in this frightful interview . -- and very bad it be . I go down , dress as I be , and my glove on , and my fan in my hand , to be just ready to step into the chariot , when I could get away ; and I think all my trembling fit have be over now ; but I be mistaken ; for I tremble sadly . yet resolve to put on as good a air as I could . so I go to the parlour , and say , make a very low courtesy , you servant , my good lady ! and you servant again , say she , my lady , for I think you be dress out like one . a charme girl , though ! say she rakish nephew , and swore a great oath : dear aunt , forgive I , but I must kiss she ; and be come to I . and I say , Forbear , uncivil gentleman ! I will not be use freely . , say my lady , sit down , and do not touch the creature -- she be proud enough already . there be a great difference in she air , I will assure you , since I see she last . well , child , say she , sneeringly , how dost find thyself ? thou 'rt mightily come on , of late !-- I hear strange report about thee ! -- thou 'rt almost get into 's paradise , I doubt !-- and will find thyself terribly mistaken in a little while , if thou thinkest my brother will disgrase he family , to humour thy baby - face ! I see , say I , sadly vex , ( she woman and nephew smile by , ) you ladyship have no very important command for I ; and I beg leave to withdraw . , say she to she woman , shut the door , my young lady and I must not have do so soon . where be you well - mannered deceiver gone , child ?-- say she .-- I , when you ladyship be pleased to speak intelligibly , I shall know how to answer . well , but my dear child , say she , in drollery , do not be too pert neither , I beseech thee . thou will not find thy master 's sister half so ready to take thy freedom , as thy mannerly master be !-- so , a little of that modesty and humility that my mother 's waiting -maid use to show , will become thee better than the air thou givest thyself , since my mother 's son have teach thee to forget thyself . I would beg , say I , one favour of you ladyship , that if you would have I keep my distance , you will not forget you own degree .-- why , suppose , , I should forget my degree , wouldst thou not keep thy distance then ? if you , madam , say I , lessen the distance yourself , you will descmend to my level , and make a equality , which I do not presume to think of ; for I can not descmend lower than I be -- at least in you ladyship 's esteem ! do I not tell you , , say she , that I should have a wit to talk to ?-- he , who swear like a fine gentleman at every word , rap out a oath , and say , droll , I think , , if I may be so bold as to say so , you should know you be speak to ! , say I , I hope there be no need of you information , and so I can not thank you for it ; and be sorry you seem to think it want a oath to convince I of the truth of it . he look more foolish than I , at this
this , if possible , not expect such a reprimand . -- and say , at last , why , Pamela , you put I half out of countenance with you witty reproof ! , say I , you seem quite a fine gentleman ; and it will not be easily do , I dare say . how now , pert one , say my lady , do you know whom you talk to ?--i think I do not , madam , reply I : and for fear I should forget myself more , I will withdraw . you ladyship 's servant , say I ; and be go : but she rise , and give I a push , and pull a chair , and , set the back against the door , sit down in it . well , say I , I can bear anything at you ladyship 's hand ; but I be ready to cry though . and I go , and sit down , and fan myself , at the other end of the room . she woman , who stand all the time , say softly , , you should not sit in my lady 's presence . and my lady , though she do not hear she , say , you shall sit down , child , in the room where I be , when I give you leave . so I stand up , and say , when you ladyship will hardly permit I to stand , one might be indulge to sit down . but I ask you , say she , Whither you master be gone ? to one , madam , about eighteen mile off , who be very sick . and when do he come home ?-- this evening , madam . and where be you go ? to a gentleman 's house in the town , madam . -- and how be you to go ? in the chariot , madam .-- why , you must be a lady in time , to be sure !-- I believe you would become a chariot mighty well , child !-- be you ever out in it with you master ? pray , you ladyship , say I , a little too pertly , perhaps , be pleased to ask half a dozen such question together ; because one answer may do for all !-- why , bold - face , say she , you will forget you distance , and bring I to you level before my time . I could no longer refrain tear , but say , pray you ladyship , let I ask what I have do , to be thus severely treat ? I never do you ladyship any harm . and if you think I be deceive , as you be pleased to hind , I should be more entitled to you pity , than you anger . she rise , and take I by the hand , and lead I to she chair ; and then sit down ; and still hold my hand , say , why , I do indeed pity you while I think you innocent ; and when my brother seize you , and bring you down hither , without you consent , I be concerned for you ; and I be still more concerned for you , and love you , when I hear of you virtue and resistance , and you laudable effort to get away from he . but when , as I fear , you have suffer yourself to be prevail upon , and have lose you innocence , and add another to the number of the fools he have ruin , ( this shock I a little , ) I can not help shew my displeasure to you . madam , reply I , I must beg no hasty judgment ; I have not lose my innocence .-- take care , take care , ! say she : do not lose you veracity , as well as you honour !-- why be you here , when you be at full liberty to go whither you please ?-- I will make one proposal to you , and if you be innocent , I be sure you will accept it . will you go and live with I ?-- I will instantly set out with you in my chariot , and not stay half a hour longer in this house , if you will go with I .-- now , if you be innocent , and willing to keep so , deny I , if you can . I be innocent , madam , reply I , and willing to keep so ; and yet I can not consent to this . then , say she , very mannerly , Thou liest , child , that be all : and I give thee up ! and so she arise , and walk about the room in great wrath . she nephew and she woman say , you ladyship 's very good ; ' ti a plain case ; a very plain case ! I would have remove the chair , to have go out ; but she nephew come and sit in it . this provoke I ; for I think I should be unworthy of the honour I be raise to , though I be afraid to own it , if I do not show some spirit ; and I say , what , sir , be you pretence in this house , to keep I a prisoner here ? because , say he -- I like it .-- do you so , sir ? reply I : if that be the answer of a gentleman to such a one as I , it would not , I dare say , be the answer of a gentleman to a gentleman .-- my lady ! my
my lady ! say he , a challenge , a challenge , by gad ! no , sir , say I , I be of a sex that give no challenge ; and you think so too , or you would not give this occasion for the word . say my lady , do not be surprised , nephew ; the wench could not talk thus , if she have not be she master 's bed - fellow .-- , , say she , and tap I upon the shoulder two or three time , in anger , thou hast lose thy innocence , girl ; and thou hast get some of thy bold master 's assurance , and art fit to go any where .-- then , and please you ladyship , say I , I be unworthy of you presence , and desire I may quit it . no , reply she , I will know first what reason you can give for not accept my proposal , if you be innocent ? I can give , say I , a very good one : but I beg to be excuse . I will hear it , say she . why , then , answer I , I should perhaps have less reason to like this gentleman , than where I be . well then , say she , I will put you to another trial . I will set out this moment with you to you father and mother , and give you up safe to they . what do you say to that ?-- ay , , say she nephew , now what do you innocence say to that ?--' fore gad , madam , you have puzzl she now . be pleased , madam , say I , to call off this fine gentleman . you kindness in these proposal make I think you would not have I bait . I will be d ---- , say he , if she do not make I a bull - dog ! why she will toss we all by and by ! , say I , you indeed behave as if you be in a bear-garden . , be quiet , say my lady . you only give she a pretence to evade my question . come , answer I , . I will , madam , say I , and it be thus : I have no occasion to be beholden to you ladyship for this honour ; for I be to set out to - morrow morning on the way to my parent .-- now again thout liest , wench !-- I be not of quality , say I , to answer such language .-- once again , say she , provoke I not , by these reflection , and this pertness ; if thou dost , I shall do something by thee unworthy of myself . that , think I , you have do already ; but I venture not to say so . but who be to carry you , say she , to you father and mother ? who my master pleasis , madam , say I . ay , say she , I doubt not thou will do every thing he please , if thou hast not already . why now tell I , , from thy heart , hast thou not be in bed with thy master ? , be quite shocked at this , and say , I wonder how you ladyship can use I thus !-- I be sure you can expect no answer ; and my sex , and my tender year , might exempt I from such treatment , from a person of you ladyship 's birth and quality , and who , be the distance ever so great , be of the same sex with I . thou be a confident wench , say she , I see !-- pray , madam , say I , let I beg you to permit I to go . I be wait for in the town , to dinner . no , reply she , I can not spare you ; and whomsoever you be to go to , will excuse you , when they be tell ' tis I that command you not to go ; -- and you may excuse it too , young lady would - be , if you consider , that it be the unexpected come of you late lady 's daughter , and you master 's sister , that command you stay . but a pre-engagement , you ladyship will consider , be something .-- ay , so it be ; but I know not what reason wait - maid have to assume these air of pre-engagement ! oh , , , I be sorry for thy thus a thy better , and give thyself such air : I see thou 'rt quite spoiled ! of a modest , innocent girl , that thou wast , and humble too , thou be now fit for nothing in the world , but what I fear thout art . why , please you ladyship , say she kinsman , what signify all you say ? the matter 's over with she , no doubt ; and she like it ; and she be in a fairy - dream , and ' ttis pity to awake she before she dream 's out .--Bad as you take I to be , madam , say I , I be not use to such language or reflection as this gentleman bestow upon I ; and I will not bear it . well , , say she , be silent ; and , shak she head , poor girl !-- say she -- what a sweet innocence be here destroy !-- a thousand pity !-- I could cry over she , if that would do she good ! but she
she be quite lost , quite undone ; and then have assume a carriage upon it , that all those creature be distinguished by ! I cry sadly for vexation ; and say , say what you please , madam ; if I can help it , I will not answer another word . come in , and ask if she ladyship be ready for dinner ? she say , yes . I would have go out with she but my lady say , take my hand , she could not spare I . and , miss , say she , you may pull off you glove , and lay you fan by , for you sha not go ; and , if you behave well , you shall wait upon I at dinner , and then I shall have a little further talk with you . say to I , Madam , may I speak one word with you ?--I can not tell , , say I ; for my lady hold my hand , and you see I be a kind of prisoner . what you have to say , , say she , you may speak before I . but she go out , and seem vex for I ; and she say , I look like the very scarlet . the cloth be laid in another parlour , and for three person , and she lead I in : , my little dear , say she , with a sneer , I will hand you in ; and I would have you think it as well as if it be my brother . what a sad case , think I , should I be in , if I be as naughty as she think I ! it be bad enough as it be . , say my lady , come , let we go to dinner . she say to she woman , do you , , help to ' tend we ; we will have no man -fellow .-- come , my young lady , shall I help you off with you white glove ? I have not , madam , say I , deserve this at you ladyship 's hand . , come in with the first dish , she say , do you expect any body else , Jewkes , that you lay the cloth for three ? say she , I hope you ladyship and madam would have be so well reconcile , that she would have sit down too .-- what mean the clownish woman ? say my lady , in great disdain : could you think the creature should sit down with I ? she do , madam , and please you ladyship , with my master .-- I doubt it not , good woman , say she , and lie with he too , do she not ? answer I , fat - face !-- how these lady be privileged . if she do , madam , say she , there may be a reason for it , perhaps ! and go out .-- so ! say she , have the wench get thee over too ? come , my little dear , pull off thy glove , I say ; and off she pull my left glove herself , and spy my ring . of my dear ! say she , if the wench have not get a ring !-- well , this be a pretty piece of foolery , indeed ! Dost know , my friend , that thou be miserably tricke ? and so , poor innocent , thou hast make a fine exchange , hast thou not ? thy honesty for this bauble ? and , I will warrant , my little dear have top she part , and parade it like any real wife ; and so mimics still the condition !-- why , say she , and turn I round , thou be as mincing as any bride ! no wonder thou be thus tricke out , and talkest of thy pre-engagement ! Pr'ythee , child , walk before I to that glass ; survey thyself , and cone back to I , that I may see how finely thou can 'st act the theatrical part give thee ! I be then resolve to try to be silent , although most sadly vex .-- so I go and sit I down in the window , and she take she place at the upper end of the table ; and she saucy , fleer at I most provokingly , sit down by she . say he , shall not the bride sit down by we , madam ? ay , well think of ! say my lady : , , you pardon for sit down in you place !-- I say nothing . say she , with a poor pun , thou hast some modesty , however , child ! for thou can 'st not stand it , so must sit down , though in my presence !-- I still keep my seat , and say nothing .-- think I , this be a sad thing , that I be hinder too from shew my duty where it be most due , and shall have anger there too , may be , if my dear master should be there before I !-- so she eat some soup , as do she kinsman ; and then , as she be cut up a fowl , say , if thou longest , my little dear , I will help thee to a pinion , or breast , or any thing . but may be , child , say he , thou likest the rump ; shall I bring it thee ? and then laugh like a idiot , for all he be a lord 's son , and may be a lord himself .-- for he be
be the son of ---- ; and he mother , who be 's sister , be dead , he have receive what education he have , from 's direction . poor wretch ! for all he greatness ! he will ne die for a plot -- at least of he own hatching . if I could then have go up , I would have give you he picture . but , for one of 25 or 26 year of age , much about the age of my dear master , he be a most odd mortal . , say my lady , help I to a glass of wine . no , , say she , you sha not ; for she be offer to do it . I will have my lady bride confer that honour upon I ; and then I shall see if she can stand up . I be silent , and never stir . Dost hear , chastity ? say she , help I to a glass of wine , when I bid thee . -- what ! not stir ? then I will come and help thee to one . still I stir not , and , fan myself , continue silent . say she , when I have ask thee , meek - one , half a dozen question together , I suppose thou will answer they all at once ! pretty creature , be not that it ? I be so vexed , I bit a piece of my fan out , not know what I do ; but still I say nothing , and do nothing but flutter it , and fan myself . I believe , say she , my next question will make up half a dozen ; and then , modest one , I shall be entitle to a answer . he rise and bring the bottle and glass ; , say he , , be pleased to help my lady , and I will be you deputy . , reply I , it be in a good hand ; help my lady yourself .-- why , creature , say she , dost thou think thyself above it ? -- and then flow into a passion :-- Insolence ! continue she , this moment , when I bid you , know you duty , and give I a glass of wine ; or -- so I take a little spirit then -- think I , I can but be beat .-- if , say I , to attend you ladyship at table , or even kneel at you foot , be require of I , I would most gladly do it , be I only the person you think I ; but , if it be to triumph over one who have receive honour , that she think require she to act another part , not to be utterly unworthy of they , I must say , I can not do it . she seem quite surprised , and look now upon she kinsman , and then upon she woman -- I be astonished -- quite astonished !-- well , then , I suppose you would have I conclude you my brother 's wife ; could you not ? you ladyship , say I , compel I to say this !-- well , return she , but dost thou thyself think thou be so ?--Silence , say she kinsman , give consent . ' Tis plain enough she do . shall I rise , madam , and pay my duty to my new aunt ? tell I , say my lady , what , in the name of impudence , possess thee to dare to look upon thyself as my sister ?-- madam , reply I , that be a question will better become you most worthy brother to answer , than I . she be rise in great wrath : but she woman say , Gand you ladyship , you will do yourself more harm than she ; and if the poor girl have be delude so , as you have hear , with the sham marriage , she will be more deserve of you ladyship 's pity than anger . true , , very true , say my lady ; but there be no bear the impudence of the creature in the mean time . I would have go out at the door , but she kinsman run and set he back against it . I expect bad treatment from she pride , and violent temper ; but this be worse than I could have think of . and I say to he , , when my master come to know you rude behaviour , you will , may be , have cause to repent it : and go and sit down in the window again . another challenge , by gad ! say he ; but I be glad she say she master !-- you see , madam , she herself do not believe she be married , and so have not be so much delude as you think for : and , come to I with a most barbarous air of insult , he say , knee on one knee before I , my new aunt , you bless or you curse , I care not which ; but quickly give I one or other , that I may not lose my dinner ! I give he a most contemptuous look : Tinsell toy , say I , ( for he be lace all over ) , twenty or thirty year hence , when you be at age , I shall know how to answer you better ; mean time , sport with you footman , and not with I ! and so I remove to another window nearer the door , and he look like a sad fool , as he be . ,
, , say my lady , this be not to be borne ! be ever the like heard ! be my kinsman and 's to be thus use by such a slut ? and be come to I : and indeed I begin to be afraid ; for I have but a poor heart , after all . but Jewkes hear high word , come in again , with the second course , and say , pray you ladyship , do not so discompose yourself . I be afraid this day 's business will make matter wider than ever between you good ladyship and you brother : for my master doat upon madam . , say she , do thou be silent ! sure , I that be bear in this house , may have some privilege in it , without be talk to by the saucy servants in it ! I beg pardon , madam , reply ; and , turn to I , say , , my master will take it very ill if you make he wait for you thus . so I rise to go out ; but my lady say , if it be only for that reason she sha not go .-- and go to the door and shut it , and say to , , do not come again till I call you ; and come to I , take my hand , and say , Find you leg , miss , if you please . I stand up , and she tap my cheek ! oh , say she , that scarlet glow shew what a rancorous little heart thou hast , if thou durst show it ! but come this way ; and so lead I to she chair : there , say she , and answer I a few question while I dine , and I will dismiss thee , till I call thy impudent master to account ; and then I will have you face to face , and all this mystery of iniquity shall be unravelled ; for , between you , I will come to the bottom of it . when she have sit down , I move to the window on the other side of the parlour , look into the private garden ; and she woman say , , do not make my lady angry . by she ladyship , as she bid you . say I , , good now , let it suffice you to attend you lady 's command , and do not lay yours upon I .-- you pardon , sweet , say she . time be much alter with you , I will assure you ! say I , she ladyship have a very good plea to be free in the house that she be bear in ; but you may as well confine you freedom to the house in which you have you breedings . why , how now , , say she ; since you provoke I to it , I will tell you a piece of my mind . Hush , hush , good woman , say I , allud to my lady 's language to , my lady want 's not you assistance :-- besides , I can not scold ! the woman be ready to flutter with vexation ; and laugh as if he would burst he side : g -- -- and I , , say he , you would better let she alone to my lady here for she will be too many for twenty such as you and I !-- and then he laugh again , and repeat -- I can not scold , quoth - a ! but , by gad , miss , you can speak ---- d spiteful word , I can tell you that !-- poor Beck , poor Beck !--' fore gad , she be quite dumbfoundered ! well , but , say my lady , come hither , and tell I truly , Dost thou think thyself really marry ? --Say I , and approach she chair , my good lady , I will answer all you command , if you will have patience with I , and not be so angry as you be : but I can not bear to be use thus by this gentleman , and you ladyship 's woman . child , say she , thou be very impertinent to my kinsman ; thou can 'st not be civil to I ; and my ladyship 's woman be much thy betters . but that be not the thing ! -- Dost thou think thou be really marry ? I see , madam , say I , you be resolve not to be pleased with any answer I shall return : if I should say , I be not , then you ladyship will call I hard name , and , perhaps , I should tell a fib . if I should say , I be , you ladyship will ask , how I have the impudence to be so ?-- and will call it a sham - marriage . I will , say she , be answer more directly . why , what , madam , do it signify what I think ? you ladyship will believe as you please . but can 'st thou have the vanity , the pride , the folly , say she , to think thyself actually marry to my brother ? he be no fool , child ; and libertine enough of conscience ; and thou be not the first in the list of he credulous harlot .-- well , well , say I , ( and be in a sad flutter , ) as I be easy , and pleas with my lot , pray , madam , let I continue so , as long as I can . it will be time enough for
for I to know the worst , when the worst come . and if it should be so bad , you ladyship should pity I , rather than thus torment I before my time . well , say she , but dost not think I be concerned , that a young wench , whom my poor dear mother love so well , should thus cast herself away , and suffer herself to be delude and undone , after such a noble stand as thou madst for so long a time ? I think myself far from be delude and undone , and be as innocent and virtuous as ever I be in my life . Thout liest , child , say she . so you ladyship tell I twice before . she give I a slap on the hand for this ; and I make a low courtesy , and say , I humbly thank you ladyship ! but I could not refrain tear : and add , you dear brother , madam , however , will not thank you ladyship for this usage of I , though I do . come a little nearer I , my dear , say she , and thou shalt have a little more than that to tell he of , if thou think 'st thou hast not make mischief enough already between a sister and brother . but , child , if he be here , I would serve thee worse , and he too . I wish he be , say I .-- Dost thou threaten I , mischief - maker , and insolent as thou art ? now , pray , madam , say I , ( but get to a little distance , ) be pleased to reflect upon all that you have say to I , since I have have the honour , or rather misfortune , to come into you presence ; whether you have say one thing befitt you ladyship 's degree to I , even suppose I be the wench and the creature you imagine I to be ?-- come hither , my pert dear , reply she , come but within my reach for one moment , and I will answer thee as thou deservest . to be sure she mean to box my ear . but I should not be worthy my happy lot if I could not show some spirit . when the cloth be take away , I say , I suppose I may now depart you presence , madam ? I suppose not , say she . why , I will lay thee a wager , child , thy stomach 's too full to eat , and so thou may 'st fast till thy mannerly master come home . pray you ladyship , say she woman , let the poor girl sit down at table with and I .-- say I , you be very kind , ; but time , as you say , be much alte with I ; and I have be of late so much honoure with better company , that I can not stoop to yours . be ever such confidence ! say my lady .-- poor Beck ! poor Beck ! say she kinsman ; why she beat you quite out of the pit !-- will you ladyship , say I , be so good as to tell I how long I be to tarry ? for you will please to see by that letter , that I be oblige to attend my master 's command . and so I give she the dear gentleman 's letter from 's , which I think would make she use I better , as she might judge by it of the honour do I by he . ay , say she , this be my worthy brother 's hand . it be direct to . that be to you , I suppose , child ? and so she run on , make remark as she go along , in this manner : my dearest PAMELa ,--' Mighty well ! '-- I hope my not come home this night , will not frighten you ! --'Vastly tender , indeed !-- and do it frighten you , child ?'-- you may believe I can not help it . ' no , to be sure !-- a person in thy way of life , be more tenderly use than a honest wife . but mark the end of it !'-- I could have wish --' , , mind this , '-- we -- ' mind the significant we , '-- have not engage to the good neighbourhood , at 's , for to - morrow night .--' why , do the good neighbourhood , and do , permit thy visit , child ? they shall have none of mine , then , I will assure they !'-- but I be so desirous to set out on for the other house -- , , but we just nick it , I find :' -- that , as well as in return for the civility of so many good friend , who will be there on purpose , I would not put it off .--' now mind , .'-- what I beg of you --' mind the wretch , that could use I and you uncle as he have do ; he be turn beggar to this creature !' -- I beg of you , therefore , my dear --'My dear ! there be for you !-- I wish I may not be quite sick before I get through .'-- what I beg of you , therefore , my dear , [ and then she look I full in the face , ] be , that you will go in the chariot to 's , the sooner in the day the better ;--'Dear heart ! and why so , when we be not expect
expect till night ? why , pray observe the reason -- ! ' [ say she ] -- because you will be diverte with the company ;--' kind , indeed !' -- who all --' , , mind this , '-- who all so much admire you . ' now he would ha ' be hang before he would have say so complaisant a thing , have he be married , I be sure !'-- very true , aunt , say he : a plain case that !--[ think I , that be hard upon poor matrimony , though I hope my lady do not find it so . but I durst not speak out .] -- who all so much admire you , [ say she , ] ' I must repeat that -- pretty miss !-- I wish thou wast as admirable for thy virtue , as for that baby - face of thine ! '-- and I hope to join you there by you tea - time in the afternoon !--'So , you be in very good time , child , a hour or two hence , to answer all you important pre-engagement ! '-- which will be better than go home , and return with you ; as it will be six mile difference to I ; and I know the good company will excuse my dress on this occasion .--'Very true ; any dress be good enough , I be sure , for such company as admire thee , child , for a companion , in thy ruin state !-- , , mind , mind , again ! more fine thing still ! '-- I count every hour of this little absence for a day !--' there be for you ! let I repeat it '-- i count every hour of this little absence for a day ! --' mind , too , the wit of the good man ! one may see love be a new thing to he . here be a very tedious time go since he see he deary ; no less than , accord to he amorous calculation , a dozen day and night , at least ! and yet , TEDIOUS as it be , it be but a little absence . well say , my good , accurate , and consistent brother !-- but wise man in love be always the greatest simpleton ! -- but now cone the reason why this Little absence , which , at the same time , be so great a absence , be so tedious :'-- for I be --'Ay , now for it !'-- with the sincerity , my dearest love --' out upon Dearest love ! I shall never love the word again ! pray bid you uncle never call I dearest love , !'-- for ever yours !--' but , brother , thou liest !-- thou knowest thout dost .-- and so , my good Lady Andrews , or what shall I call you ? you dearest love will be for ever yours ! and hast thout the vanity to believe this ? -- but stay , here be a postscript . the poor man know not when to have do to he dearest love . -- he be sadly in of r't , truly ! why , he dearest love , you be mighty happy in such a lover !'-- if you could go to dine with they --' cry you mercy , my dearest love , now come the pre - engagement !' -- it will be a freedom that will be very pleasing to they , and the more , as they do not expect it . well , so much for this kind letter ! but you see you can not honour this admiring company with this little expect , and , but in complaisance to he folly , I dare say , little desire freedom . and I can not forbear admir you so much myself , my dearest love , that I will not spare you at all , this whole evening : for ' ttis a little hard , if thy master 's sister may not be blest a little bit with thy charme company . so I find I have shew she my letter to very little purpose , and repent it several time , as she read on .-- well , then , say I , I hope you ladyship will give I leave to send my excuse to you good brother , and say , that you ladyship be come , and be so fond of I , that you will not let I leave you .-- pretty creature , say she ; and wantest thout thy good master to come , and quarrel with he sister on thy account ? -- but thou shal not stir from my presence ; and I would now ask thee , what it be thou meanest by shew I this letter ?-- why , madam , say I , to show you ladyship how I be engage for this day and evening .-- and for nothing else ? say she . why , I can not tell , madam , say I : but if you can collect from it any other circumstance , I might hope I should not be the worse treat . I see she eye begin to sparkle with passion : and she take my hand , and say , grasp it very hard , I know , confident creature , that thou shewedst it I to insult I !-- you shew it I , to let I see , that he could be civiller to a beggar bear , than to I , or to my good Davers ! -- you shew it I , as if you would have I to be as credulous a fool as yourself , to believe you marriage true , when I
I know the whole trick of it , and have reason to believe you do too ; and you shew it I , to upbraid I with he stooping to such pain dirt , to the disgrace of a family , ancient and untainted beyond most in the kingdom . and now will I give thee one hundred guinea for one bold word , that I may fall thee at my foot ! be not this very dreadful ! to be sure , I have better have keep the letter from she . I be quite frightened ! -- and this fearful menace , and she fiery eye , and rageful countenance , make I lose all my courage .-- so I say , weep , you ladyship , pity I !-- indeed I be honest ; indeed I be virtuous ; indeed I would not do a bad thing for the world ! though I know , say she , the whole trick of thy pretend marriage , and thy foolish ring here , and all the rest of the wicked nonsense , yet I should not have patience with thee , if thou shouldst but offer to let I know thy vanity prompt thee to believe thou be marry to my brother !-- I could not bear the thought !-- So take care , Pamela ; take care , beggarly brat ; take care . good madam , say I , spare my dear parent . they be honest and industrious : they be once in a very creditable way , and never be beggar . Misfortunes may attend any body : and I can bear the cruellest imputation on myself , because I know my innocence ; but upon such honest , industrious parent , who go through the greatest trials , without be beholden to any thing but 's blessing , and they own hard labour ; I can not bear reflection . what ! be thou set up for a family , creature as thou art ! give I patience with thee ! I suppose my brother 's folly , and he wickedness , together , will , in a little while , occasion a search at the herald ' office , to set out thy wretch obscurity ! provoke I , I desire thou will ! one hundred guinea will I give thee , to say but thou thinkest thou be marry to my brother . you ladyship , I hope , will not kill I : and since nothing I can say will please you , but you ladyship be resolve to quarrel with I ; since I must not say what I think , on one hand nor another ; whatever you ladyship design by I , be pleased to do , and let I depart you presence ! she give I a slap on the hand , and reach to box my ear ; but Jewkes hearken without , and she woman too , they both come in at that instant ; and say , push herself in between we ; you ladyship know not what you do ! indeed you do not ! my master would never forgive I , if I suffer , in he house , one he so dearly love , to be so use ; and it must not be , though you be Lady Davers . she woman too interposed , and tell she , I be not worth she ladyship 's anger . but she be like a person beside herself . I offer to go out , and take my hand to lead I out : but she kinsman set he back against the door , and put he hand to he sword , and say , I should not go , till he aunt permit it . he draw it half - way , and I be so terrified , that I cry out , oh , the sword ! the sword ! and , not know what I do , I run to my lady herself , and clasp my arm about she , forget , just then , how much she be my enemy , and say , sinke on my knee , defend I , good you ladyship ! the sword ! the sword !-- say , oh ! my lady will fall into fit ! but be herself so start at the matter be carry so far , that she do not mind she word , and say , , do not draw you sword ! -- you see , as great as she spirit be , she can not bear that . come , say she , be comforte ; he sha not frighten you !--I will try to overcome my anger , and will pity you . so , wench , rise up , and do not be foolish . hold she salt to my nose , and I do not faint . and my lady say , Jewkes , if you would be forgive , leave and I by ourselves ; and , , do you withdraw ; only you , , stay . so I sit down in the window , all in a sad fluster ; for , to be sure , I be sadly frightened . -- say she woman , you should not sit in my lady 's presence , . yes , let she sit till she be a little recovered of she fright , say my lady , and do you set my chair by she . and so she sit over -against I , and say , to be sure , , you have be very provoke with you tongue , to be sure you have , as well upon my nephew , ( who be a man of quality too , ) as I . and palliat she cruel usage , and begin , I suppose , to
to think herself she have carry it further than she could answer it to she brother , she want to lay the fault upon I . , say she , you have be very saucy ; and beg my pardon , and beg 's pardon , and I will try to pity you . for you be a sweet girl , after all ; if you have but hold out , and be honest . ' tTis injurious to I , madam , say I , to imagine I be not honest ! -- she , have you not be a - bed with my brother ? tell I that . you ladyship , reply I , ask you question in a strange way , and in strange word . o ! you delicacy be wounded , I suppose , by my plain question !-- this niceness will soon leave you , wench : it will , indeed . but answer I directly . then you ladyship 's next question , say I , will be , be I marry ? and you will not bear my answer to that -- and will beat I again . I ha not beat you yet ; have I , ? say she . so you want to make out a story , do you ?--But , indeed , I can not bear thou shouldst so much as think thou be my sister . I know the whole trick of it ; and so , ' ti my opinion , dost thou . it be only thy little cunning , that it might look like a cloak to thy yield , and get better term from he . Pr'ythee , pr'ythee , wench , thou seest I know the world a little ;-- almost as much at thirty - two , as thou dost at sixteen .-- remember that ! I rise from the window , and walk to the other end of the room , beat I again , if you please , say I , but I must tell you ladyship , I scorn you word , and be as much married as you ladyship ! at that she run to I ; but she woman interpose again : let the vain wick creature go from you presence , madam , say she . she be not worthy to be in it . she will but vex you ladyship . away , , say she . that be a assertion that I would not take from my brother , I can not bear it . as much marry as I !-- be that to be borne ? but if the creature believe she be , madam , say she woman , she be to be as much pitie for she credulity , as despise for she vanity . I be in hope to have slipt out at the door ; but she catch hold of my gown , and pull I back . pray you ladyship , say I , do not kill I !-- I have do no harm . -- but she lock the door , and put the key in she pocket . so , see before the window , I lift up the sash , and say , Jewkes , I believe it would be best for the chariot to go to you master , and let he know , that be here ; and I can not leave she ladyship . she be resolve to be displease , let I say what I would . say she , no , no ; he will then think , that I make the creature my companion , and know not how to part with she . I think you ladyship , reply I , could not have take exception at this message . thou knowest nothing , wench , say she , of what belong to people of condition : how shouldst thou ? , think I , do I desire it , at this rate . what shall I say , madam ? say I . nothing at all , reply she ; let he expect he dearest love , and be disappoint ; it be but add a few more hour , and he will make every one a day , in he amorous account .-- come nearer I , and my lady walk about the room , be then at the end , I whisper , let stay at the elm ; I will have a struggle of r't by and by . as much marry as I ! repeat she .-- the insolence of the creature !-- and so she walk about the room , talk to herself , to she woman , and now and then to I ; but see I could not please she , I think I have better be silent . and then it be , be I not worthy a answer ? if I speak , say I , you ladyship be angry at I , though ever so respectfully ; if I do not , I can not please : would you ladyship tell I but how I shall oblige you , and I would do it with all my heart . Confess the truth , say she , that thou be a undone creature ; hast be in bed with thy master ; and art sorry for it , and for the mischief thou hast occasion between he and I ; and then I will pity thee , and persuade he to pack thee off , with a hundred or two of guinea ; and some honest farmer may take pity of thee , and patch up thy shame , for the sake of the money ; and if nobody will have thee , thou must vow penitence , and be as humble as I once think thee . I be quite sick at heart , at
at all this passionate extravagance , and to be hinder from be where be the desire of my soul , and afraid too of incurr my dear master 's displeasure ; and , as I sit , I see it be no hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard , the parlour be even with the yard , and so have a fair run for it ; and after I have see my lady at the other end of the room again , in she walk , have not pull down the sash , when I speak to , I get upon the seat , and whip out in a minute , and run away as hard as I could drive , my lady call after I to return , and she woman at the other window : but two of she servant appear at she cry out , and she bid they to stop I , I say , touch I at you peril , fellow ! but they lady 's commands would have prevail on they , have not , who , it seem , have be kindly order , by , to be within call , when she see how I be treat , come up , and put on one of he deadly fierce look , the only time , I think , it ever become he , and say , he would chine the man , that be he word , who offer to touch he lady ; and so he run alongside of I ; and I hear my lady say , the creature fly like a bird ! and , indeed , , with he huge stride , could hardly keep pace with I ; and I never stop , till I get to the chariot ; and have get down , see I run at a distance , and hold the door in he hand , with the step ready down ; and in I jump , without touch the step , say , drive I , drive I , as fast as you can , out of my lady 's reach ! and he mount ; and say , do not be frightened , madam ; nobody shall hurt you .-- and shut the door , and away drive ; but I be quite out of breath , and do not recover it , and my fright , all the way . be so kind , but I do not know it till the chariot stop at 's , to step up behind the carriage , lest , as he say , my lady should send after I ; and he tell , when he get home , that he never see such a runner as I in he life . when the chariot stop , which be not till six o'clock , so long do this cruel lady keep I , run out to I : of madam , say she , ten time welcome ! but you will be beat , I can tell you ! for here have be ---- come these two hour , and be very angry with you . that be hard indeed , say I ;-- indeed I can not afford it ;-- for I hardly know what I say , have not recover my fright . let I sit down , miss , any where , say I ; for I have be sadly off . so I sit down , and be quite sick with the hurry of my spirit , and lean upon she arm . say she , you lord and master come in very moody ; and when he have stay a hour , and you not come , he begin to fret , and say , he do not expect so little complaisance from you . and he be now sit down , with great persuasion , to a game at loo .-- come , you must make you appearance , lady fair ; for he be too sullen to attend you , I doubt . you have no strangers , have you miss ? say I .-- only two woman relation from , reply she , and a humble servant of one of they .-- only all the world , miss ! say I .-- what shall I do , if he be angry ? I can not bear that . just as I have say so , come in and to chide I , as they say , for not come sooner . and before I could speak , come in my dear master . I run to he . how dy 'e ? say he ; and salut I , with a little more formality than I could well bear .-- I expect half a word from I , when I be so complaisant to you choice , would have determine you , and that you would have be here to dinner ; -- and the rather , as i make my request a reasonable one , and what I think would be agreeable to you . of dear sir , say I , pray , pray , hear I , and you will pity I , and not be displease ! will tell you , that as soon as I have you kind command , I say , I would obey you , and come to dinner with these good lady ; and so prepare myself instantly , with all the pleasure in the world . and miss say I be they dear !-- look you , say miss , do I not tell you , stately one , that something must have happen ? but , of these tyrant ! these man ! why , what hinder it , my dear ? say he : give yourself time ; you seem out of breath !-- of sy , say
say I , out of breath ! well I may !-- for , just as I be ready to come away , who should drive into the court -yard , but Lady Davers ! -- ! Nay , then , my sweet dear , say he , and salute I more tenderly , hast thou have a worse trial than I wish thee , from one of the haughtiest woman in , though my sister ! -- for , she too , my , be spoilead by my good mother ! -- but have you see she ? yes , sir , say I , and more than see she !-- why sure , say he , she have not have the insolence to strike my girl ! -- , say I , but tell I you forgive I ; for indeed I could not come sooner ; and these good lady but excuse I ; and I will tell you all another time ; for to take up the good company 's attention now , will spoil they pleasantry , and be to they , though more important to I , like the broken china you caution I about . that be a dear girl ! say he ; I see my hint be not throw away upon you ; and I beg pardon for be angry with you ; and , for the future , will stay till I hear you defence , before I judge you . , this be a little better ! to own a fault be some reparation ; and what every lordly husband will not do . he say , but tell I , my dear , do Lady Davers offer you any incivility ? of sir , reply I , she be you sister , and I must not tell you all ; but she have use I very severely ! do you tell she , say he , you be marry ? yes , sir , I do at last ; but she will have it ' tis a sham - marriage , and that I be a vile creature : and she be ready to beat I , when I say so : for she could not have patience , that I should be deem she sister , as she say . how unlucky it be , reply he , I be not at home ?-- why do you not send to I here ? send , sy ! I be keep prisoner by force . they would not let I stir , or do you think I would have be hinder from obey you ? Nay , I tell they , that I have a pre-engagement ; but she ridicule I , and say , waiting - maid talk of pre-engagement ! and then I shew she you kind letter ; and she make a thousand remark upon it , and make I wish I have not . in short , whatever I could do or say , there be no pleasing she ; and I be a creature and wench , and all that be natch . but you must not be angry with she on my account . well , but , say he , I suppose she hardly ask you to dine with she ; for she come before dinner , I presume , if it be soon after you have receive my letter ! no , sir , dine with my lady ! no , indeed ! why , she would make I wait at table upon she , with she woman , because she would not expose herself and I before the man -servant ; which you know , sir , be very good of she ladyship . well , say he , but do you wait upon she ? would you have have I , sir ? say I .-- only , , reply he , if you do , and know not what belong to you character , as my wife , I shall be very angry with you . , say I , I do not , but refuse it , out of consideration to the dignity you have raise I to ; else , sir , I could have wait on my knee upon you sister . now , say he , you confirm my opinion of you prudence and judgment . she be a insolent woman , and shall dearly repent it . but , sir , she be to be excuse , because she will not believe I be indeed married ; so do not be too angry at she ladyship . he say , lady , pray do not let we keep you from the company ; I will only ask a question or two more , and attend you . , I so much long to hear this story of poor madam 's persecution , that , if it be not improper , I should be glad to stay . would stay for the same reason ; my master say , he have no secret to ask ; and that it be kind of they to interest themselves in my grievance . but go into the company , and tell they the cause of my detention ; for , it seem , my dear master love I too well , to keep to himself the disappointment my not be here to receive he , be to he ; and they have all give the two and , the guest , such a character of I , that they say they be impatient to see I . say my master , but , , you say they and they : who have my sister with she besides she woman ? she nephew , sir , and three footman on horseback ; and she and she woman be in she chariot and six . that be a sad coxcomb
coxcomb , say he : how do he behave to you ?-- not extraordinarily , sir ; but I should not complain ; for I be even with he ; because I think I ought not to bear with he as with my lady . by ! say he , if I know he behave unhandsomely to my jewel , I would send he home to he uncle without he ear . indeed , sir , return I , I be as hard upon he as he be upon I . say he , ' Tis kind to say so ; but I believe I shall make they dearly repent they visit , if I find they behaviour to call for my resentment . but , sure , my dear , you might have get away when you go to you own dinner ? indeed , sir , say I , she ladyship lock I in , and would not let I stir .-- so you ha 'nt eat any dinner ? no , indeed , sir , nor have a stomach for any . my poor dear , say he . but then , how get you away at last ? of sir , reply I , I jump out of the parlour window , and run away to the chariot , which have wait for I several hour , by the elm - walk , from the time of my lady 's come ( for I be just go , as I say ) ; and conduct I through she servants , whom she call to , to stop I ; and be so kind to step behind the chariot , unknown to I , and see I safe here . I be sure , say he , these insolent creature must have treat you vilely . but tell I , what part do act in this affair ? a very kind part , sir , say I , in my behalf ; and I shall thank she for it . sweet creature ! say he , thou lovest to speak well of every body ; but I hope she deserve it ; for she know you be marry . -- but come , we will now join the company , and try to forget all you have suffer , for two or three hour , that we may not tire the company with we concern and resume the subject as we go home : and you shall find I will do you justice , as I ought . but you forgive I , sir , say I , and be not angry ? forgive you , my dear ! return he -- I hope you forgive I ! I shall never make you satisfaction for what you have suffer from I , and for I ! and with those word he lead I into the company . he very kindly present I to the two stranger lady , and the gentleman , and they to I : and , who be at card , rise from table , and salute I : Adad ! madam , say he , I be glad to see you here . what , it seem you have be a prisoner ! ' Twas well you be , or you spouse and I should have sit in judgment upon you , and condemn you to a fearful punishment for you first crime of laesa majestatis : ( I have this explained to I afterwards , as a sort of treason against my liege lord and husband :) for we husbands hereabout , say he , be resolve to turn over a new leaf with we wife , and you lord and master shall show we the way , I can tell you that . but I see by you eye , my sweet culprit , add he , and you complexion , you have have sour sauce to you sweet meat . say , I think we be oblige to we sweet guest , at last ; for she be force to jump out at a window to come to we . indeed ! say ;-- and my master 's back be turn , say she , Lady Davers , when a maiden , be always vastly passionate ; but a very good lady when she passion be over . and she would make nothing of slapp she maid about , and begge they pardon afterwards , if they take it patiently ; otherwise she use to say the creature be even with she . ay , say I , I have be a many creature and wench , and I know not what ; for these be the name she give I . and I think I ought to act up to the part she dear brother have give I ; and so I have but just escape a good cuffing . say to she sister , as I overhear , but she do not design I should , what a sweet creature be this ! and then she take so little upon she , be so free , so easy , and own the honour do she , so obligingly ! say , softly , the loveliest person I ever see ! who could have the heart to be angry with she one moment ? , here , my dearest neighbour , these gentry be admir you strangely ; and say , you be the loveliest lady he ever see ; and he say it to he own mistress 's face too , I will assure you !-- or else , say , I should think he much flatter I . o , madam , you be exceedingly oblige ! but you kind opinion ought to teach I humility , and to reverence so generous a worth as can give a preference against yourself , where it be so little due
due . indeed , madam , say , I love my sister well ; but it would be a high compliment to any lady , to be deem worthy a second or third place after you . there be no answering such politeness , say I : I be sure be very cruel to keep I from such company . ' Tbe we loss , madam , say . I will allow it , say I , in degree ; for you have all be deprived , several hour , of a humble admirer . say , I never before see so young a lady shine forth with such graces of mind and person . ! sir , say I , my master come up , mine be but a borrowed shine , like that of the moon . here be the sun , to whose fervent glow of generosity I owe all the faint lustre , that you goodness be pleased to look upon with so much kind distinction . be pleased to hold up he hand ; and the lady look upon one another . and my master say , hear part of the last sentence , what be the pretty subject , that my be display so sweetly she talents upon ? oh ! sir , say , I will pronounce you the happiest man in : and so say they all . my master say , most generously , thank ye , thank ye , thank ye , all round , my dear friend . I know not you subject ; but if you believe I so , for a single instance of this dear girl 's goodness , what must I think myself , when bless with a thousand instance , and experience it in every single act and word ! I do assure you my 's person , all lovely as you see it , be far short of she mind : that , indeed , first attract my admiration , and make I she lover : but they be the beauty of she mind , that make I she husband ; and proud , my sweet dear , say he , press my hand , be I of that title . well , say Perry , very kindly and politely , excellent as you lady be , I know not the gentleman that could deserve she , but that one who could say such just and such fine thing . I be all abashed ; and take 's hand , and say , save I , dear miss , by you sweet example , from my rise pride . but could I deserve half these kind thing , what a happy creature should I be ! say , you deserve they all , indeed you do . the greatest part of the company have sit down to loo , my master be press , say he would take one game at whist ; but have rather be excuse too , have be up all night : and i ask how he friend do ? we will talk of that , say he , another time ; which , and he seriousness , make I fear the poor gentleman be dead , as it prove . we cast in , and and my master be together , and and I ; and I have all four honour the first time , and we be up at one deal . say my master , a honourable hand , , should go with a honourable heart ; but you would not have be up , if a knave have not be one . Whist , sir , say , you know , be a court game originally ; and the knave , I suppose , signify always the prime minister . ' Tis well , say my master , if now there be but one knave in a court , out of four person , take the court through . the king and queen , sir , say , can do no wrong , you know . so there be two that must be good out of four ; and the ace seem to plain a card to mean much hurt . we compliment the king , say my master , in that manner ; and ' ti well to do so , because there be something sacr in the character . but yet , if force of example be consider , it be go a great way ; for certainly a good master make a good servant , generally speak . one thing , add he , I will say , in regard to the ace : I have always look upon that plain and honest look card in the light you do : and have consider whist as a english game in its original ; which have make I fonder of it than of any other . for by the ace I have always think the law of the land denote ; and as the ace be above the king or queen , and win they , I think the law should be think so too ; though , may be , I shall be deem a Whig for my opinion . I shall never play whist , say , without think of this , and shall love the game the better for the thought ; though I be no party -man . nor I , say my master ; for I think the distinction of whig and tory odious ; and love the one or the other only as they be honest and worthy man ; and have never ( nor never shall , hope ) give a vote , but accord to what I think be for the public good , let either whig or tory propose it . I wish , sir , reply , all gentleman in you station would act
act so . if there be no undue influence , say my master , I be willing to think so well of all mankind , that I believe they generally would . but you see , say he , by my 's hand , when all the court -cards get together , and be act by one mind , the game be usually turn accordingly : though now and then , too , it may be so circumstanced , that honours will do they no good , and they be force to depend altogether upon trick . I think this way of talk prettier than the game itself . but I say , though I have win the game , I hope I be no trickster . no , say my master , forbid but court -card should sometimes win with honou ! but you see , for all that , you game be as much owe to the knave as the king ; and you , my fair - one , lose no advantage , when it be put into you power . , , say I , I should not have do justice to my partner . you be certainly right , , reply he ; though you thereby beat you husband . , say I , you may be my partner next , and I must do justice , you know . well , say he , always choose so worthy a friend , as chance have give you for a partner , and I shall never find fault with you , do what you will . say , you be very good to I , sir ; and , I observe , seem pleased with the compliment to she humble servant ; by which I see she esteem he , as he appear to deserve . dear sir ! say I , how much better be this , than to be lock in by ! the supper be bring in sooner on my account , because I have have no dinner ; and there pass very agreeable compliment on the occasion . would help I first , because I have so long fasted , as she say . would have place himself next I : and my master say , he think it be best , where there be a equal number of lady and gentleman , that they should sit , intermingle , that the gentleman might be employ in help and serve the lady . say , she hope would not sit above any ladie at he own table especially . well , say he , I shall sit over-against she , however , and that be as well . my dearest sir could not keep he eye off I , and see generously delighted with all I do , and all I say ; and every one be pleased to see he kind and affectionate behaviour to I . brotch up the discourse about again ; and my master say , I fear , , you have be hardly use , more than you will say . I know my sister 's passionate temper too well , to believe she could be over-civil to you , especially as it happen so unluckily that I be out . if , add he , she have no pique to you , my dear , yet what have pass between she and I , have so exasperate she , that I know she would have quarrell with my horse , if she have think I value it , and nobody else be in she way . dear sir , say I , do not say so of good Lady Daver . why , my dear , say he , I know she come on purpose to quarrel ; and have she not find herself under a very violent uneasiness , after what have pass between we , and my treatment of she lord 's letter , she would not have offer to come near I . what sort of language have she for I , ? of sir , very good , only she well - mannered brother , and such as that ! only , say he , ' tis take up the attention of the company disagreeably , or I could tell you almost every word she say . wish to hear a further account of my lady 's conduct , and most of the company join with she , particularly ; who say , that as they know the story , and 's temper , though she be very good in the main , they could wish to be so agreeably entertaine , if he and I please ; because they imagine I should have no difficulty after this . tell I , then , , say he , do she lift up she hand at you ? do she strike you ? but I hope not ! a little slap of the hand , say I , or so .-- Insolent woman ! she do not , I hope , offer to strike you face ? why , say I , I be a little saucy once or twice ; and she would have give I a cuff on the ear , if she woman and have not interpose . why do you not come out at the door ? because , say I , she ladyship sit in the chair against it , one while , and another while lock it ; else I offer several time to get away . she know I expect you here : you say , you shew she my letter to you ? yes , sir , say I ; but I have better not ; for she as then more exasperated , and make strange comment upon it . I doubt it not , say he ; but , do she not see , by
by the kind epithet in it , that there be no room to doubt of we be marry ? o , sir , reply I , and make the company smile , she say , for that very reason she be sure I be not marry . that be like my sister ! say he ; exactly like she ; and yet she live very happily herself : for she poor lord never contradict she . indeed he dare not . you be a great many wench , be you not , my dear ? for that be a great word with she . -- yes , sir , say I , wench and creature out of number ; and worse than all that . what ? tell I , my dear . , say I , I must not have you angry with Lady Davers ; while you be so good to I , ' tis all nothing ; only the trouble I have that I can not be suffer to show how much I honoure she ladyship , as you sister . well , say he , you need not be afraid to tell I : I must love she after all ; though I shall not be pleased with she on this occasion . I know it be she love for I , though thus oddly expressed , that make she so uneasy : and , after all , she come , I be sure , to be reconcile to I ; though it must be through a good hearty quarrel first : for she can show a good deal of sunshine ; but it must be always after a storm ; and I will love she dearly , if she have not be , and will not be , too hard upon my dearest . say , , you be very good , and very kind ; I love to see this complaisance to you sister , though she be in fault , so long as you can show it with so much justice to the sweetest innocence and merit in the world . by all that be good , , say he , I would present my sister with a thousand pound , if she would kindly take my dear Pamela by the hand , and wish she joy , and call she sister !-- and yet I should be unworthy of the dear creature that smile upon I there , if it be not principally for she sake , and the pleasure it would give she , that I say this : for I will never be thoroughly reconcile to my sister till she do ; for I most sincerely think , as to myself , that my dear wife , there she sit , do I more honour in she new relation , than she receive from I . , say I , I be overwhelm with you goodness !-- and my eye be fill with tear of joy and gratitude : and all the company with one voice bless he . and be pleased to say , the behaviour of you two happy one , to each other , be the most edify I ever know . I be always improve when I see you . how happy would every good lady be with such a gentleman , and every good gentleman with such a lady !-- in short , you seem for one another . of madam , say I , you be so kind , so good to I , that I know not how to thank you enough ! -- she , you deserve more than I can express ; for , to all that know you story , you be a matchless person . you be a ornament to we sex and you virtue , though ---- be so generous as he be , have meet with no more than its due reward . long bless you together ! you be , say my dearest sir , very good to I , madam , I be sure . I have take libertie in my former life , that deserv not so much excellence . I have offend extremely , by trial glorious to my , but disgraceful to I , against a virtue that I now consider as almost sacr ; and I shall not think I deserve she , till I can bring my manners , my sentiment , and my action , to a conformity with she own . in short , my , continue he , I want you to be nothing but what you be , and have be . you can not be better ; and if you could , it would be but fill I with despair to attain the awful height of virtue at which you have arrive . perhaps , add the dear gentleman , the scene I have beheld within these twelve hour , have make I more serious than otherwise I should have be : but I will assure you , before all this good company , I speak the sentiment of my heart , and those not of this day only . what a happy daughter be yours , of my dear father and mother ! I owe it all to 's , and to yours and my good lady 's instruction : and to these let I always look back with grateful acknowledgment , that I may not impute to myself , and be proud , my inexpressible happiness . the company be so kindly pleased with we concern , and my dear master 's goodness , that he , obserive they indulgence , and be himself curiious to know the further particular of what have pass between my lady and I , repeat he question , what she have call I besides wench and creature ? and I say , my lady , suppose I be
be wick , lament over I , very kindly , my depravity and fall , and say , what a thousand pity it be , so much virtue , as she be pleased to say , be so destroy ; and that I have yield , after so noble a stand ! as she say . excuse I , gentleman and lady , say I ! you know my story , it seem ; and I be command , by one who have a title to all my obedience , to proceed . they give all of they bow of approbation , that they might not interrupt I ; and I continue my story -- the men-servant withdraw , at a motion of ----, on my look towards they : and then , at 's come in , I proceed . I tell she ladyship , that I be still innocent , and would be so , and it be injuriious to suppose I otherwise . why , tell I , wench , say she -- but I think I must not tell you what she say . yes , do , say my master , to clear my sister ; we shall think it very bad else . I hold my hand before my face -- why , she say , tell I , wench , hast thou not be -- hesitate -- a very free creature with thy master ? that she say , or to that effect -- and when I say , she ask strange question , and in strange word , she ridicule my delicacy , as she call it ; and say , my niceness would not last long . she say , I must know I be not really married , that my ring be only a sham , and all be my cunning to cloak my yielding , and get better term . she say , she know the world as much at thirty - two , as I do at sixteen ; and bid I remember that . I take the liberty to say , ( but I get a good way off , ) that I scorn she ladyship 's word , and be as much marry as she ladyship . and then I have certainly be cuff , if she woman have not interpose , and tell she I be not worthy she anger ; and that I be as much to be pitie for my credulity , as despise for my vanity . my poor , say my master , this be too , too hard upon you ! of sir , say I , how much easier it be to I than if it have be so !-- that would have break my heart quite !-- for then I should have deserve it all , and worse ; and these reproach , add to my own guilt , would have make I truly wretch ! , at whose right - hand I sit , kiss I with a kind of rapture , and call I a sweet exemplar for all my sex . say very handsome thing ; so do and , with tear in he eye , say to my master , why , neighbour , neighbour , this be excellent , by my troth . I believe there be something in virtue , that we have not well consider . on my soul , there have been but one angel come down for these thousand year , and you have get she . well , my dearest , say my master , pray proceed with you story until , we have do supper , since the lady seem pleased with it . why , sir , say I , she ladyship go on in the same manner ; but say , one time , ( and hold I by the hand , ) she would give I a hundred guinea for one provoke word ; or , if I would but say I believe myself married , that she might fall I at she foot : but , sir , you must not be angry with she ladyship . she call I paint dirt , baby - face , wait -maid , beggar 's brat , and beggar - bear ; but I say , as long as I know my innocence , I be easy in every thing , but to have my dear parent abuse . they be never beggar , nor beholden to any body ; nor to any thing but 's and they own labour ; that they once live in credit ; that misfortune might befall any body ; and that I could not bear they should be treat so undeservedly . then she ladyship say , ay , she suppose my master 's folly would make we set up for a family , and that the herald 's office would shortly be search to make it out . exactly my sister again ! say he . so you could not please she any way ? no , indeed , sir . when she command I to fill she a glass of wine , and would not let she woman do it , she ask , if I be above it ? I then say , if to attend you ladyship at table , or even kneel at you foot , be require of I , I would most gladly do it , be I only the person you think I . but if it be to triumph over one , who have receive honour which she think require from she another part , that she may not be utterly unworthy of they , I must say , I can not do it . this quite astonish she ladyship ; and a little before , she kinsman bring I the bottle and glass , and require I to fill it for
for my lady , at she command , and call himself my deputy : and I say , ' in a good hand ; help my lady yourself . so , sir , add I , you see I could be a little saucy upon occasion . you please I well , my , say he . this be quite right . but proceed . she ladyship say , she be astonished ! add , she suppose I would have she look upon I as she brother 's wife : and ask I , what , in the name of impudence , possess I , to dare to look upon myself as she sister ? and I say , that be a question better become she most worthy brother to answer , than I . and then I think I should have have she ladyship upon I ; but she woman interpose . I afterwards tell , at the window , that since I be hinder from go to you , I believe it be best to let go with the chariot , and say , be come , and I could not leave she ladyship . but this do not please ; and I think it would too ; for she say , no , no , he will think I make the creature my companion , and know not how to part with she . exactly , say he , my sister again . and she say , I know nothing what belong to people of condition ; how should I ?-- what shall I say , madam ? say I . nothing at all , answer she ; let he expect he dearest love , allud to you kind epithet in you letter , and be disappoint ; it be but add a few more hour to this heavy absence , and every one will become a day in he amorous account . so , to be short , I see nothing be to be do ; and I fear , sir , you would wonder at my stay , and be angry ; and I watch my opportunity , till my lady , who be walk about the room , be at the further end ; and the parlour be a ground - floor , in a manner , I jump out at the window , and run for it . she ladyship call after I ; so do she woman ; and I hear she say , I fly like a bird ; and she call two of she servants in sight to stop I ; but I say , touch I at you peril , fellow ! and , have be plan at hand by , ( who be very good in the whole affair , and incur she ladyship 's displeasure , once or twice , by take my part , ) see how I be use , put on a fierce look , cock he hat with one hand , and put t'other on he sword , and say , he would chine the man who offer to touch he lady . and so he run alongside of I , and could hardly keep pace with I :-- and here , my dear sir , conclude I , I be , at yours and the good company 's service . they seem highly pleased with my relation ; and my master say , he be glad behave so well , as also . yes , sir , say I : when interpose once , she ladyship say , it be hard , she , who be bear in that house , could not have some privilege in it , without be talk to by the saucy servants . and she call she another time fat - face , and woman she most violently . well , say my master , I be glad , my dear , you have have such a escape . my sister be always passionate , as know : and my poor mother have enough to do with we both . for we neither of we want spirit : and when I be a boy , I never come home from school or college for a few day , but though we longe to see one another before , yet ere the first day be over , we have a quarrel ; for she , be seven year older than I , be always for domineering over I , and I could not bear it . and I use , on she frequently quarrell with the maid , and be always at a word and a blow , to call she ; for she name be . and when my courte she , my poor mother have make up quarrel between they three time in a day ; and I use to tell she , she would certainly beat she husband , marry whom she would , if he do not beat she first , and break she spirit . yet have she , continue he , very good quality . she be a dutiful daughter , be a good wife ; she be bountiful to she servant , firm in she friendship , charitable to the poor , and , I believe , never any sister better love a brother , than she I : and yet she always love to vex and tease I ; and as I would bear a resentment longer than she , she would be one moment the most provoke creature in the world , and the next would do any thing to be forgive ; and I have make she , when she be the aggressor , follow I all over the house and gare to be upon good term with I . but this case pique she more , because she have find out a match for I in the family
family of a person of quality , and have set she heart upon bring it to effect , and have even proceed far in it , without my knowledge , and bring I into the lady 's company , unknowing of she design . but I be then averse to matrimony upon any term ; and be angry at she proceeding in it so far without my privity or encouragement : and she cannot , for this reason , bear the thought of my be now married , and to she mother 's waiting - maid too , as she remind my dear , when I have decline she proposal with the daughter of a noble earl . this be the whole case , say he ; and , allow for the pride and violence of she spirit , and that she know not , as I do , the transcendent excellency of my dear Pamela , and that all she view , in she own conception , be mine and the family honour , she be a little to be allow for : though , never fear , my , but that I , who never have a struggle with she , wherein I do not get the better , will do you justice , and myself too . this account of Lady Davers please every body , and be far from be to she ladyship 's disadvantage in the main ; and I would do any thing in the world to have the honour to be in she good graces : yet I fear it will not be easily , if at all , effect . but I will proceed . after supper , nothing would serve and , but we must have a dance ; and , who play a good fiddle , urge it forward . my dear master , though in a riding - dress , take out . , for a man of he year , dance well , and take I out ; but put on one of he free joke , that I be fitter to dance with a younger man ; and he would have it , ( though I have not dance since my dear lady 's death to signify , except once or twice to please , and , indeed , believe all my dancing day over , ) that as my master and I be the best dancer , we should dance once together , before folk , as the odd gentleman say ; and my dear sir be pleased to oblige he : and afterwards dance with , who have much more skill and judgment than I ; though they compliment I with a easier shape and air . we leave the company with great difficulty at about eleven , my dear master have be up all night before , and we be at the greatest distance from home ; though they seem inclinable not to break up so soon , as they be neighbour ; and the lady say , they longe to hear what would be the end of 's interview with she brother . my master say , he fear we must not now think of go next day to , as we have intend ; and perhaps might see they again . and so we take leave , and set out for home ; where we arrive not till twelve o'clock ; and find Lady Davers have go to be about eleven , want sadly that we should come home first ; but so do not I . tell we , that my lady be sadly fret that I have get away so ; and see a little apprehensive of what I would say of the usage I have receive from she . she ask , if she think I be really marry ? and tell she yes , she fall into a passion , and say , , bold woman , I can not bear thee ! see not my face till I send for thee ! thou hast be very impudent to I once or twice to - day already , and be now worse than ever . she say , she would not have tell she ladyship , if she have not ask she ; and be sorry she have offend . she send for she at supper time : say she , I have another question to ask thee , woman , and tell I yes , if thou darest . be ever any thing so odd ?-- why then , say , I will say no , before you ladyship speak .-- my master laugh : poor woman ! say he .-- she call she insolent , and assurance ; and say , , bold woman as thou art !-- but come hither . Dost thou know if that young harlot be to be with my brother to - night ? she say she know not what to answer , because she have threaten she if she say yes . but at last my lady say , I will know the bottom of this iniquity . I suppose they will not have so much impudence to be together while I be in the house ; but I dare say they have be bed - fellow . say she , I will lie to - night in the room I be bear in ; so get that be ready . that room be we bedchamber , , after some hesitation , reply , Madam , my master lie there , and have the key . I believe , woman , say she , thou tellest I a story . indeed , madam , say she , he do ; and have some papers there he will let nobody see ; for Jewkes say , she fear she would beat she if she go up , and find by my clothes
clothes , and some of my master 's , how it be . so she say , I will then lie in the best room , as it be call ; and shall lie in the little green room adjoin to it . have thy master get the key of those ?-- no , madam , say : I will order they to be make ready for you ladyship . and where dost thou lay they pursy side ? say she . up two pair of stair , madam , next the garden . and where lie the young harlotry ? continue she . sometimes with I , madam , say she . and sometimes with thy virtuous master , I suppose ? say my lady .-- , woman ! what sayest thou ? I must not speak , say . well , thou mayest go , say she ; but thou hast the air of a secret keeper of that sort I dare say thou lot set the good work forward most cordially . poor , say my master , and laugh most heartily . this talk we have whilst we be undressing . so she and she woman lay together in the room my master lay in before I be happy . I say , dear sir , pray , in the morning let I lock myself up in the closet , as soon as you rise ; and not be call down for ever so much ; for I be afraid to see she ladyship : and I will employ myself about my journal , while these thing be in my head . do not be afraid , my dear , say he : be not I with you ? pitie I for what I have undergone in the day ; and I say , we will not make the worst of it to my dear master , because we will not exasperate where we would reconcile : but , add I , I be much oblige to you , , and I thank you . say my master , I hope she do not beat you lady , ? not much , sir , say she ; but I believe I save my lady once : yet , add she , I be most vex at the young lord . ay , , say my master , let I know he behaviour . I can chastise he , though I can not my sister , who be a woman ; let I therefore know the part he acte . nothing , my dear sir , say I , but impertinence , if I may so say , and foolishness , that be very provoking ; but I spare he not ; and so there be no room , sir , for you anger . no , sir , say , nothing else indeed . how be she woman ? say my master . pretty impertinent , reply , as lady ' woman will be . but , say I , you know she save I once or twice . very true , madam , return . and she say to I at table , that you be a sweet creature ; she never see you equal ; but that you have a spirit ; and she be sorry you answer she lady so , who never bear so much contradiction before . I tell she , add , that if I be in you ladyship 's place , I should have take much more upon I , and that you be all sweetness . and she say , I be get over , she see . morning , the sixth of my happiness . my master have say to , that he should not rise till eight or nine , as he have sit up all the night before : but it seem , my lady , know he usually rise about six , get up soon after that hour ; raise she woman and she nephew ; have a whimsical scheme in she head , to try to find whether we be in bed together : and , about half a hour after six , she rap at we chamber door . my master be wake at the noise , and ask , who be there ? open the door , say she ; open it this minute ! I say , cling about he neck , dear , dear sir , pray , pray do not !-- o save I , save I ! do not fear , , say he . the woman 's mad , I believe . but he call out ; who be you ? what do you want ? --You know my voice well enough , say she :-- I will come in .-- pray , sy , say I , do not let she ladyship in .-- do not be frightene , my dear , say he ; she think we be not marry , and be afraid to be find a - bed together . I will let she in ; but she sha not come near my dearest . so he slipt out of bed , and put on some of he clothes , and gown and slipper , he say , what bold body dare disturb my repose thus ? and open the door . in rush she : I will see you wickedness , say she , I will ! in vain shall you think to hide it from I .-- what should I hide ? say he . how dare you set a foot into my house , after the usage I have receive from you ?-- I have cover myself over head and ears , and tremble every joint . he look , and ' spy she woman and kinsman in the room , she cry out , witness , ; bear witness
witness , ; the creature be now in he bed ! and not see the young gentleman before , who be at the foot of the bed , he say , how now , sir ? what be you business in this apartment ? Bego this moment !-- and he go away directly . , say my lady , you see the creature be in he bed . I do , madam , answer she . my master come to I , and say , ay , look , , and bear witness : here be my Pamela !-- my dear angel , my lovely creature , do not be afraid ; look up , and see how frantickly this woman of quality behave . at that , I just pee , and see my lady , who could not bear this , come to I ; and she say , Wick abandon wretch ! Vile brother , to brave I thus ! I will tear the creature out of bed before you face , and expose you both as you deserve . at that he take she in he arm , as if she have be nothing ; and carry she out of the room , she cry out , ! ! help I , ! the wretch be go to fl I down stair ! she woman run to he , and say , good sir , for 's sake do no violence to my lady ! she ladyship have be ill all night . he sit she down in the chamber she lay in , and she could not speak for passion . take care of you lady , say he ; and when she have render herself more worthy of my attention , I will see she ; till then , at she peril , and yours too , come not near my apartment . and so he come to I , and , with all the sweet soothing word in the world , pacify my fear , and give I leave to go to write in my closet , as soon as my fright be over , and to stay there till thing be more calm . and so he dress himself , and go out of the chamber , permit I , at my desire , to fasten the door after he . at breakfast - time my master tap at the door , and I say , who be there ? I , my dearest , say he . oh ! then , reply I , I will open it with pleasure . I have write on a good deal ; but I put it by , when I run to the door . I would have lock it again , when he be in ; but he say , be not I here ? do not be afraid . say he , will you come down to breakfast , my love ? of no , dear sir , say I ; be pleased to excuse I ! say he , I can not bear the look of it , that the mistress of my house should breakfast in she closet , as if she durst not come down , and I at home !-- o , dearest sir , reply I , pray pass that over , for my sake ; and do not let my presence aggravate you sister , for a kind punctilio ! then , my dear , say he , I will breakfast with you here . no , pray , dear sir , answer I , breakfast with you sister . that , my dear , reply he , will too much gratify she pride , and look like a slight to you .-- dear sir , say I , you goodness be too great , for I to want punctilious proof of it . pray oblige she ladyship . she be you guest surly , sir , you may be freest with you dutiful wife ! she be a strange woman , say he : how I pity she !-- she have throw herself into a violent fit of the colic , through passion : and be but now , she woman say , a little easier . I hope , sy , say I , when you carry she ladyship out , you do not hurt she . no , reply he , I love she too well . I set she down in the apartment she have choose : and she but now desire to see I , and that I will breakfast with she , or refuse to touch any thing . but , if my dearest please , I will insist it shall be with you at the same time . o , no , no , dear sir ! say I ; I should not forgive myself , if I do . I would on my knee beg she ladyship 's goodness to I , now I be in you presence ; though I think I ought to carry it a little stiff when you be absent , for the sake of the honour you have do I . and , dear sir , if my deepest humility will please , permit I to show it . you shall do nothing , return he , unworthy of my wife , to please the proud woman ! -- but I will , however , permit you to breakfast by yourself this once , as I have not see she since I have use she in so barbarous a manner , as I understand she exclaim I have ; and as she will not eat any thing , unless I give she my company .-- so he salute I , and withdraw ; and I lock the door after he again for fear . soon after rap at the door . who be there
there ? say I . only I , madam . so I open the door . ' tTis a sad thing , madam , say she , you should be so much afraid in you own house . she bring I some chocolate and toast ; and I ask she about my lady 's behaviour . she say , she would not suffer any body to attend but she woman , because she would not be hear what she have to say ; but she believe , she say , she master be very angry with the young lord , as she call she kinsman ; for , as she pass by the door , she hear he say , in a high tone , I hope , sir , you do not forget what belong to the character you assume ; or to that effect . about one o'clock my master come up again , and he say , will you come down to dinner , , when I send for you ? whatever you command , sir , I must do . but my lady will not desire to see I . no matter whether she will or no . but I will not suffer , that she shall prescribe she insolent will to my wife , and in you own house too .-- I will , by my tenderness to you , mortify she pride ; and it can not be do so well as to she face . Dearest sir , say I , pray indulge I , and let I dine here by myself . it will make my lady but more inveterate . -- say he , I have tell she we be marry . she be out of all patience about it , and yet pretend not to believe it . upon that I tell she , then she shall have it she own way , and that I be not . and what have she to do with it either way ? she have scolde and beg , command and pray , bless I , and curse I , by turn , twenty time in these few hour . and I have sometimes soothe she , sometimes rage ; and at last leave she , and take a turn in the garden for a hour to compose myself , because you should not see how the foolish woman have ruffle I ; and just now I come out , see she come in . just as he have say so , I cry , oh ! my lady , my lady ! for I hear she voice in the chamber , say , brother , brother , one word with you -- stop in sight of the closet where I be . he step out , and she go up to the window that look towards the garden , and say , mean fool that I be , to follow you up and down the house in this manner , though I be shunn and avoid by you ! you a brother !-- you a barbarian ! be it possible we could be bear of one mother ? why , say he , do you charge I with a conduct to you , that you bring upon yourself ? -- be it not surprise that you should take the liberty with I , that the dear mother you have name never give you a example for to any of she relation ?-- be it not sufficient , that I be insolently take to task by you in you letter , but my retirement must be invade ? my house insulte ? and , if I have one person dearer to I than another , that that person must be single out for a object of you violence ? ay , say she , that one person be the thing ! -- but though I come with a resolution to be temperate , and to expostulate with you on you avoid I so unkindly , yet can not I have patience to look upon that bed in which I be bear , and to be make the guilty scene of you wickedness with such a ---- ! say he , I charge you ! call not the dear girl by any name unworthy of she . you know not , as I tell you , she excellence ; and I desire you will not repeat the freedom you have take below . she stamp with she foot , and say , give I patience ! so much contempt to a sister that love you so well ; and so much tenderness to a vile ---- he put he hand before she mouth : be silent , say he , once more , I charge you ! you know not the innocence you abuse so freely . I ought not , neither will I bear it . she sit down and fan herself , and burst into tear , and such sob of grief , or rather passion , that grieve I to hear ; and I sit and tremble sadly . he walk about the room in great anger ; and at last say , let I ask you , Lady Davers , why I be thus insolently to be call to account by you ? be I not independent ? be I not of age ? be I not at liberty to please myself ?-- wWould to , that , instead of a woman , and my sister , any man breathing have dared , whatever be he relation under that of a father , to give himself half the air you have do !-- why do you not send on this accurse errand you lord , who could write I such a letter as no gentleman should write , nor any gentleman tamely receive ? he should have see the difference .
. we all know , say she , that , since you italian duel , you have commence a bravo ; and all you air breathe as strongly of the manslayer as of the libertine . this , say he , I will bear ; for I have no reason to be asham of that duel , nor the cause of it ; since it be to save a friend , and because it be level at myself only : but suffer not you tongue to take too great a liberty with my Pamela . she interrupt he in a violent burst of passion . if I bear this , say she , I can bear any thing !-- of the little strumpet !-- he interrupt she then , and say wrathfully , , rageful woman ! bego this moment from my presence ! leave my house this instant !-- I renounce you , and all relation to you ! and never more let I see you face , or call I brother ! and take she by the hand to lead she out . she laid hold of the curtain of the window , and say , I will not go ! you shall not force I from you thus ignominiously in the wretch 's hearing , and suffer she to triumph over I in you barbarous treatment of I . not consider any thing , I run out of the closet , and throw myself at my dear master 's foot , as he hold she hand , in order to lead she out ; and I say , Dearest sir , let I beg , that no act of unkindness , for my sake , pass between so worthy and so near relation . dear , dear madam , say I , and clasp she knee , pardon and excuse the unhappy cause of all this evil ; on my knee I beg you ladyship to receive I to you grace and favour , and you shall find I incapable of any triumph but in you ladyship 's goodness to I . , say she , art thou to beg a excuse for I ?-- Art thou to implore my forgiveness ? be it to thee I be to owe the favour , that I be not cast headlong from my brother 's presence ? Begone to thy corner , wench ! begone , I say , lest thy paramou kill I for trampling thee under my foot ! rise , my dear , say my master ; rise , dear life of my life ; and expose not so much worthiness to the ungrateful scorn of so violent a spirit . and so he lead I to my closet again , and there I sit and weep . she woman come up , just as he have lead I to my closet , and be return to she lady ; and she very humbly say , excuse my intrusion , good sir !-- I hope I may come to my lady . yes , , say he , you may come in ; and pray take you lady down stair with you , for fear I should too much forget what belong either to my sister or myself ! I begin to think ( see she ladyship so outrageous with she brother ) what a happy escape I have have the day before , though hardly enough use in conscience too , as I think . she woman beg she ladyship to walk down ; and she say , , seest thout that bed ? that be the bed that I be bear in ; and yet that be the bed thout sawest , as well as , the wicked in , this morning , and this brother of mine just risen from she ! true , say he ; you both see it , and it be my pride that you could see it . ' Ti my bridal bed ; and ' tis abominable that the happiness I know before you come hither , should be so barbarously interrupt . swear to I but , thout bold wretch ! say she , swear to I , that be really and truly thy lawful wife , without sham , without deceit , without double - mean ; and I know what I have to say ! I will humour you for once , say he ; and then swore a solemn oath that I be . and , say he , do I not tell you so at first ? I can not yet believe you , say she ; because , in this particular , I have rather have call you knave than fool .-- provoke I not too much , say he ; for , if I should as much forget myself as you have do , you would have no more of a brother in I , than I have a sister in you . who marry you ? say she : tell I that ! be it not a broken attorney in a parson 's habit ? tell I truly , in the wench 's hearing . when she be undeceive , she will know how to behave herself better ! thank , think I , it be not so . no , say he ; and I will tell you , that I bless , I abhor that project , before it be bring to bear : and marry we .-- then , say she -- but answer I another question or two , I beseech you : who give she away ? , say he . where be the ceremony perform ? in my little chapel , which you may see , as it be put in order on purpose . now , say she , I begin to fear there be something in it ! but who be present
present ? say she . Methinks , reply he , I look like a fine puppy , to suffer myself to be thus interrogate by a insolent sister : but , if you must know , be present . of the procuress ! say she : but nobody else ? yes , say he , all my heart and soul ! ! say she ; and what would thy father and mother have say , have they live to this day ? they consent , reply he , I should have think it my duty to ask ; but not yours , madam . suppose , say she , I have marry my father 's groom ! what would you have say to that ?-- I could not have behave worse , reply he , than you have do . and would you not have think , say she , I have deserve it . say he , do you pride let you see no difference in the case you put ? none at all , say she . where can the difference be between a beggar 's son marry by a lady , or a beggar 's daughter make a gentleman 's wife ? then I will tell you , reply he ; the difference be , a man ennoble the woman he take , be she who she will ; and adopt she into he own rank , be it what it will : but a woman , though ever so nobly bear , debase herself by a mean marriage , and descend from she own rank to he she stoop to . when the royal family of ally itself into the low family of , ( comparatively low , I mean , ) do any body scruple to call the lady , , and of ? and do any body think she daughter , the late and , less royal for that ? when the break - fortune peer go into the city to marry a rich tradesman 's daughter , be he duke or earl , do not he consort immediately become ennoble by he choice ? and who scruple to call she lady , duchess , or countess ? but when a duchess or countess dowager descend to mingle with a person of obscure birth , do she not then degrade herself ? and be she not effectually degrad ? and will any duchess or countess rank with she ? now , , do you not see a difference between my marry my dear mother 's belove and deserive wait -maid , with a million of excellency about she , and such graces of mind and person as would adorn any distinction ; and you marry a sordid groom , whose constant train of education , conversation , and opportunity , could possibly give he no other merit , than that which must proceed from the vilest , lowest taste , in he sordid dignifier ? of the wretch ! say she , how he find excuse to palliate he meanness ! again , say he , let I observe to you , Lady Davers , when a duke marry a private person , be he not still she head , by virtue of be she husband ? but , when a lady descend to marry a groom , be not the groom she head , be she husband ? and do not the difference strike you ? for what lady of quality ink to respect another , who have make so sordo a choice , and set a groom above she ? for , would not that be to put that groom upon a par with themselves ?-- call this palliation , or what you will ; but if you see not the difference , you be blind ; and a very unfit judge for yourself , much more unfit to be a censurer of I . I would have you , say she , publish you fine reason to the world , and they will be sweet encouragement to all the young gentleman who read they to cast themselves away on the servant - wench in they family . not at all , , reply he : for , if any young gentleman stay till he find such a person as my , so enrich with the beauty of person and mind , so well accomplish , and so fitte to adorn the degree she be raise to , he will stand as easily acquit , as I shall be to all the world that see she , except there be many more lady Daver than I apprehend can possibly be meet with . and so , return she , you say you be actually and really married , honestly , or rather foolishly marry , to this slut ? I be , indeed , say he , if you presume to call she so ! and why should I not , if I please ? who be there ink to contradict I ? whom have I hurt by it ?-- have I not a estate , free and independent ?-- be I likely to be behole to you , or any of my relation ? and why , when I have a sufficiency in my own single hand , should I scruple to make a woman equally happy , who have all I want ? for beauty , virtue , prudence , and generosity too , I will tell you , she have more than any lady I ever see . yes , , she have all these naturally ; they be bear with she ; and a few year ' education , with she genius , have do more for she , than a whole life have do for other . no more , no more , I beseech you , say she ; thou surfeitest I , honest man ! with
with thy weak folly . thou be worse than a idolater ; thou hast make a graven image , and thou fallest down and worshippest the work of thy own hand ; and , - like , wouldst have every body else bow down before thy calf ! well say , ! whenever you passion suffer you to descmend to witticism ; ' tis almost over with you . but let I tell you , though I myself worship this sweet creature , that you call such name , I want nobody else to do it ; and should be glad you have not intrude upon I , to interrupt I in the course of we mutual happiness . well say , well say , my kind , my well - mannered brother ! say she . I shall , after this , very little interrupt you mutual happiness , I will assure you . I think you a gentleman once , and pride myself in my brother : but I will say now with the burial service , Ashes to ash , and dirt to dirt ! ay , say he , , and there we must all end at last ; you with all you pride , and I with my plentiful fortune , must come to it ; and then where will be you distinction ? let I tell you , except you and I both mmend we manners , though you have be no duellist , no libertine , as you call I , this amiable girl , whom you vanity and folly so much despise , will out - soar us both , infinitely out - soar we ; and he who judge best , will give the preference where due , without regard to birth or fortune . Egregious preacher ! say she : what , my brother already turn !-- see what marriage and repentance may bring a man to ! I heartily congratulate this change !-- well , say she , ( and come towards I , and I tremble to see she come ; but she brother follow to observe she , and I stand up at she approach , and she say , ) give I thy hand , , , what shall I call thee ?-- thou hast do wonder in a little time ; thou hast not only make a rake a husband but thou hast make a rake a preacher ! but take care , add she , after all , in ironical anger , and tap I on the neck , take care that thy vanity begin not where he end ; and that thou callest not thyself my sister . she shall , I hope , , say he , when she can make as great a convert of you from pride , as she have of I , from libertinism . just then come up , and say dinner be ready . come , my , say my dear master ; you desire to be excuse from breakfasting with we ; but I hope you will give and I you company to dinner . how dare you insult I thus ? say my lady .-- how dare you , say he , insult I by you conduct in my own house , after I have tell you I be marry ? how dare you think of stay here one moment , and refuse my wife the honour that belong to she as such ? ! say she , give I patience ! and hold she hand to she forehead . pray , sir , dear sir , say I , excuse I , do not vex my lady :-- be silent , my dear love , say he ; you see already what you have get by you sweet condescension . you have throw yourself at she foot , and , insolent as she be , she have threaten to trample upon you . she will ask you , presently , if she be to owe she excuse to you interposition ? and yet nothing else can make she forgive . poor lady , she could not bear this ; and , as if she be discompose , she run to she poor grieved woman , and take hold of she hand , and say , lead I down , lead I down , ! let we instantly quit this house , this curse house , that once I take pleasure in ! order the fellow to get ready , and I will never see it , nor its owner , more . and away she go down stair , in a great hurry . and the servant be order to make ready for they departure . I see my master be trouble , and I go to he , and say , , dear sir , follow my lady down , and pacify she . ' Ti she love to you .-- poor woman ! say he , I be concerned for she ! but I insist upon you come down , since thing be gone so far . she pride will get new strength else , and we shall be all to begin again . Dearest , dear sir , say I , excuse my go down this once ! indeed , my dear , I will not , reply he . what ! shall it be say , that my sister shall scare my wife from my table , and I present ?-- no , I have borne too much already ; and so have you : and I charge you come down when I send for you . he depart , say these word , and I durst not dispute ; for I see he be determine . and there be as much majesty as goodness in he , as I have often have reason to observe ; though never more
more than on the present occasion with he sister . she ladyship instantly put on she hood and glove , and she woman tie up a handkerchief full of thing ; for she principal matter be not unpacked ; and she coachman get she chariot ready , and she footman they horse ; and she appear resolve to go . but she kinsman and have take a turn together , somewhere ; and she would not come in , but sit frett on a seat in the fore - yard , with she woman by she ; and , at last , say to one of the footman , do you , , stay to attend my nephew ; and we will take the road we come . go to she ladyship , and say , you ladyship will be pleased to stay dinner ; 'tis just come upon table ? no , say she , I have enough of this house ; I have indeed . but give my service to you master , and I wish he happier than he have make I . he have send for I down , and I come , though unwillingly , and the cloth be laid in the parlour I have jump out of ; and there be my master walk about it . come in , and ask , if he pleas to have dinner bring in ? for my lady would not come in , but desire she service , and wish he happier than he have make she . he , see she at the window , when he go to that side of the room , all ready to go , steep out to she , and say , , if I think you would not be harden , rather than soften , by my civility , I would ask you to walk in ; and , at least , let you kinsman and servants dine before they go . she weep , and turn she face from he , to hide it . he take she hand , and say , come , sister , let I prevail upon you : walk in . no , say she , do not ask I .-- I wish I could hate you , as much as you hate I !-- you do , say he , and a great deal more , I will assure you ; or else you would not vex I as you do .-- come , pray walk in . do not ask I , say she . she kinsman just then return : why , madam , say he , you ladyship will not go till you have dine , I hope . no , , say she , I can not stay ; I be a intruder here , it seem ! -- , say my master , of the occasion you give for that word . you violent passion be the only intruder ! lay they aside , and never sister be dearer to a brother . do not say such another word , say she , I beseech you ; for I be too easy to forgive you any thing for one kind word !-- you shall have one hundred , say he , nay , ten thousand , if they will do , my dear sister . and , kiss she , he add , pray give I you hand . , say he , put up the horse ; you be all as welcome to I , for all you lady 's angry with I , as at any inn you can put up at . come , ----, say he , lead you aunt in ; for she will not permit that honou to I . this quite overcame she ; and she say , give she brother she hand , yes , I will , and you shall lead I any where ! and kiss he . but do not think , say she , I can forgive you neither . and so he lead she into the parlour where I be . but , say she , why do you lead I to this wench ?

I be quite asham of it . she put a little bit to she mouth , but lay it down in she plate again : I can not eat , say she ; I can not swallow , I be sure . it will certainly choak I . he have forbid he menservant to come in , that they might not behold the scene he expect ; and rise from table himself , and fill a glass of wine , she

I touch he toe again ; but he mind it not ; and I see he be right ; for she ladyship begin to recollect herself , and do not behave half so ill before the servants , as she have do ; and help herself with some little freedom ; but she could not forbear a strong sigh and a sob now and then . she call for a glass of the same wine she have drank before . say he , shall I help you again , ? -- and rise , at the same time , and go to the sideboard , and fill she a glass . indeed , say she , I love to be soothe by my brother !-- you health , sir ! say my master to I , with great sweetness , my dear , now I be up , I will fill for you !-- I must serve both sister alike ! she look at the servant , as if he be a little check upon she , and say to my master , how now , sir !-- not that you know of . he whisper she , do not show any contempt before my servants to one I have so deservedly make they mistress . consider , ' tis do .-- ay , say she , that be the thing that kill I . he give I a glass : my good lady 's health , sir , say I .-- that will not do , say she , lean towards I , softly : and be go to say wench , or creature , or some such word . and my master , see look towards she , she eye be red and swell , say , indeed , sister , I would not vex myself about it , if I be you . about what ? say she . why , reply he , about you lord be not come down , as he have promise . he sit down , and she tap he on the shoulder : ah ! wick one , say she , nor will that do neither !-- why , to be sure , add he , it would vex a lady of you sense and merit to be slighte , if it be so ; but I be sure my lord love you , as well as you love he ; and you know not what may have happen . she shook she head , and say , that be like you art !-- this make one amaze you should be so catch !-- who , my lord catch ! say he : no , no ! he will have more wit than so ! but I never hear you be jealous before . , say he , have you any reason to think so now !-- Honest friend , you need not wait , say she ; my woman will help we to what we want . yes , let he , reply he .

I be intend to set out thither to - morrow , but I will tarry you pleasure , if you will go with I . be thy wife , as thou callest she , to go along with thee , friend ? say she . yes , to be sure , answer he , my dear Quaker sister ; and take she hand , and smile . and would 'st have I parade it with she on the road ?-- hey ?-- and make one to grase she retinue ? tell I how thoud 'st chalk it out , if I would do as thou would 'st have I , honest friend ? he clasp he arm about she , and kiss she : you be a dear saucy sister , say he ; but I must love you !-- why , I will tell you how I would have it . here shall you , and my Pamela -- leave out my , I desire you , if you would have I sit patiently . no , reply he , I can not do that . here shall you , and my Pamela , go together in you chariot , if you please ; and she will then appear as one of you retinue ; and you nephew and I will sometimes ride , and sometimes go into my chariot , to you woman . should 'st thou like this , creature ? say she to I .-- if you ladyship think it not too great a honour for I , madam , say I . yes , reply she , but my ladyship do think it would be too great a honour . now I think of it , say he , this must not be neither ; for , without you would give she the hand in you own chariot , my wife would be think you woman , and that must not be . why , that would , may be , say she , be the only inducement for I to bear she near I , in my chariot .-- but , how then ?-- why then , when we come home , we would get to come to we , and stay a month or two . and what if he be to come ?-- why I would have you , as I know you have a good fancy , give you judgment on some pattern I expect from , for clothes .-- Provok wretch ! say she ; now I wish I may keep my hand to myself . I do not say it to provoke you , say he , nor ought it to do so . but when I tell you I be marry , be it not a consequence that we must have new clothes ? Hast thou any more on these oblige thing to say to I , friend ? say she . I will make you a present , return he , worth you acceptance , if you will grase we with you company at church , when we make we appearance .-- take that , say she , if I die for it , wretch that thout art ! and be go to hit he a great slap ; but he hold she hand . she kinsman say , dear aunt , I wonder at you ! why , all these be thing of course . I beg leave to withdraw ; and , as I go out , my good master say , there be a person ! there be a shape ! there be a sweetness ! o , ! be you a man , you would doat on she , as I do . yes , say the naughty lady , so I should , for my harlot , but not for my wife . I turn , on this , and say , indeed you ladyship be cruel ; and well may gentleman take libertie , when lady of honou say such thing ! and I weep , and add , you ladyship 's inference , if you good brother be not the most generous of man , would make I very unhappy . no fear , wench ; no fear , say she ; thou 'lt hold he as long as any body can , I see that !-- poor never have half the interest in he , I will assure you . stay , my , say he , in a passion ; stay , when I bid you . you have now hear two vile charge upon I !-- I love you with such a true affection , that I ought to say something before this malicious accuser , that you may not think you consummate virtue link to so black a villain . she nephew seem uneasy , and blame she much ; and I come back , but tremble as I stand ; and he set I down , and say , take my hand , I have be accuse , my dear , as a dueller , and now as a profligate , in another sense ; and there be a time I should not have receive these imputation with so much concern as I now do , when I would wish , by degree , by a conformity of my manners to you virtue , to show
show every one the force you example have upon I . but this briefly be the case of the first . I have a friend , who have be basely attempt to be assassinate by bravoe , hire by a man of title in , who , like many other person of title , have no honour ; and , at , I have the fortune to disarm one of these bravoe in my friend 's defence , and make he confess he employer ; and he , I own , I challenge . at we meet , and he die in a month after , of a fever ; but , I hope , not occasion by the slight wound he have receive from I ; though I be obliged to leave upon it , sooner than I intend , because of he numerous relation , who look upon I as the cause of he death ; though I pacify they by a letter I write they from , acquaint they with the baseness of the decease : and they follow I not to , as they intend . this be one of the good - natured hint that might shock you sweetness , on reflec that you be yok with a murderer . the other -- , brother , say she , say no more . ' Ti you own fault if you go further . she shall know it all , say he ; and I defy the utmost stretch of you malice . when I be at college , I be well receive by a widow lady , who have several daughter , and but small fortune to give they ; and the old lady set one of they ( a deserve good girl she be , ) to draw I into marriage with she , for the sake of the fortune I be here to ; and contrive many opportunity to bring we and leave we together . I be not then of age ; and the young lady , not half so artful as she mother , yield to my address before the mother 's plot could be ripen , and so utterly disappoint it . this , my , be the , this malicious woman , with the worst intentions , have infor you of . and whatever other libertie I may have take , ( for perhaps some more I have , which , have she know , you have heard of , as well as this , ) I desire heaven will only forgive I , till I revive it be vengeance by the like offence , in injury to my . and now , my dear , you may withdraw ; for this worthy sister of mine have say all the bad she know of I ; and what , at a proper opportunity , when I could have convince you , that they be not my boast , but my concern , I should have acquaint you with myself ; for I be not fond of be think better than I be : though I hope , from the hour I devote myself to so much virtue , to that of my death , my conduct shall be irreproachable . she be greatly move at this , and the noble manner in which the dear gentleman own and repent of he fault ; and gush out into tear , and say , no , do not yet go , , I beseech you . my passion have carry I too far , a great deal ; and , come to I , she shook my hand , and say , you must stay to hear I beg he pardon ; and so take he hand . -- but , to my concern , ( for I be grieve for she ladyship 's grief , ) he burst from she ; and go out of the parlour into the garden in a violent rage , that make I tremble . she ladyship sit down , and lean she head against my bosom , and make my neck wet with she tear , hold I by the hand ; and I weep for company . -- she kinsman walk up and down the parlour in a sad fret ; and go out afterwards , he come in , and say , ---- have order he chariot to be get ready , and will not be speak to by any body . where be he ? say she .-- walk in the garden till it be ready , reply he . well , say she , I have indeed go too far . I be bewitch ! and now , say she , malicious as he call I , will he not forgive I for a twelvemonth : for I tell you , , if ever you offend , he will not easily forgive . I be all delighted , though sad , to see she ladyship so good to I . will you venture , say she , to accompany I to he ? -- you follow a lion in he retreat ? --I will attend you ladyship , say I , wherever you command . well , wench , say she ; , I mean ; thou be very good in the main !-- I should have love thee as well as my mother do -- if -- but ' tis all over now ! indeed you wshould not have marry my brother ! but come , I must love he ! let 's find he out ! and yet will he use I worse than a dog !-- I should not , add she , have so much exasperate he : for , whenever I have , I have always have the worst of it . he know I love he ! in this manner she ladyship talk to I
I , lean on my arm , and walk into the garden . I see he be still in a tumult , as it be ; and he take another walk to avoid we . she call after he , and say , , brother , let I speak to you !-- one word with you ! and as we make haste towards he , and come near to he ; I desire , say he , that you will not oppress I more with you folly , and you violence . I have borne too much with you , and I will vow for a twelvemonth , from this day -- Hush , say she , do not vow , I beg you for too well will you keep it , I know by experience , if you do . you see , say she , I stoop to ask to be my advocate . sure that will pacify you ! indeed , say he , I desire to see neither of you , on such a occasion ; and let I only be leave to myself , for I will not be intrude upon thus ; and be go away .-- but , say she , one word first , I desire .-- if you will forgive I , I will forgive you .-- what , say the dear man , haughtily , will you forgive I ?-- why , say she , for she see he too angry to mention he marriage , as a subject that require she pardon -- I will forgive you all you bad usage of I this day . I will be serious with you , sister , say he : I wish you most sincerely well ; but let we , from this time , study so much one another be quiet , as never to come near one another more . never ? say she .-- and can you desire this ? barbarous brother ! can you ?-- I can , I do , say he ; and I have nothing to do , but to hide from you , not a brother , but a murderer , and a profligate , unworthy of you relation ; and let I be consign to penitence for my past evils : a penitence , however , that shall not be break in upon by so violent a accuser . , say he , and make I tremble , how dare you approach I , without leave , when you see I thus disturb ?-- never , for the future , come near I , when I be in these tumult , unless I send for you . dear sir ! say I -- leave I , interrupt he . I will set out for this moment ! what ! sir , say I , without I ?-- what have I do ? you have too meanly , say he , for my wife , stoop to this furious sister of mine ; and , till I can recollect , I be not pleas with you : but shall attend you , and two other of my servants ; and shall wait upon you part of the way : and I hope you will find I in a better disposition to receive you there , than I be at part with you here . have I not hope , that this be partly put on to intimidate my lady , I believe I could not have borne it : but it be grievous to I ; for I see he be most sincerely in a passion . I be afraid , say she , he would be angry at you , as well as I ; for well do I know he unreasonable violence , when he be move . but one word , sir , say she ; , if you will not I ; for she have commit no offence , but that of good - nature to I , and at my request . I will be go myself , directly as I be about to do , have you not prevent I . I prevent you , say he , through love ; but you have string I for it , through hatred . but as for my , I know , besides the present moment , I can not be angry with she ; and therefore I desire she never to see I , on such occasion , till I can see she in the temper I ought to be in , when so much sweetness approach I . ' therefore I say , my dearest , leave I now . but , sir , say I , must I leave you , and let you go to without I ? oh , dear sir , how can I ?--Say my lady , you may go to - morrow , both of you , as you have design ; and I will go away this afternoon : and , since I can not be forgive , will try to forget I have a brother . may I , sir , say I , beg all you anger on myself , and to be reconcile to you good sister ? ! reply he , and make I start ; thou then so hardy , so well able to sustain a displeasure , which of all thing , I expect from thy affection , and thy tenderness , thou would 'st have wish to avoid ?-- now , say he , and take my hand , and , as it be , toss it from he , bego from my presence , and reflect upon what you have say to I ! I be so frightened , ( for then I see he take amiss what I say , ) that I take hold of he knee , as he be
be turn from I ; and I say , forgive I , good sir ! you see I be not so hardy ! I can not bear you displeasure ! and be ready to sink . he sister say , only forgive ; ' ti all I ask -- you will break she spirit quite ! -- you will carry you passion as much too far as I have do ! -- I need not say , say he , how well I love she ; but she must not intrude upon I at such time as these !-- I have intend , as soon as I could have quell , by my reason , the tumult you have cause by you violence , to have come in , and take such a leave of you both , as might become a husband , and a brother : but she have , unbidden , break in upon I , and must take the consequence of a passion , which , when raise , be as uncontrollable as you own . say she , Did I not love you so well , as sister never love a brother , I should not have give you all this trouble . and do I not , say he , love you better than you be resolve to deserve , I should be indifferent to all you say . but this last instance , after the duelling story ( which you would not have mention , have you not know it be always matter of concern for I to think upon ) , of poor , be a piece of spite and meanness , that I can renounce you my blood for . well , say she , I be convince it be wrong . I be asham of it myself . ' Twas poor , 'tbe mean , ' tbe unworthy of you sister : and ' tis for this reason I stoop to follow you , to beg you pardon , and even to procure one for my advocate , who I think have some interest in you , if I might have believe you own profession to she ; which now I shall begin to think make purposely to insult I . I care not what you think !-- after the meanness you have be guilty of , I can only look upon you with pity : for , indeed , you have fall very low with I . ' tTis plain I have , say she . but I will bego . -- and so , brother , let I call you for this once ! bless you ! and , say she ladyship , bless you ! and kiss I , and wept . I durst say no more : and my lady turn from he , he say , you sex be the --- l ! how strangely can you discompose , calm , and turn , as you please , we poor weathercock of man ! you last kind bless to my I can not stand ! kiss but each other again . and then he take both we hand , and join they ; and my lady salut I again , with tear on both side , he put he kind arm about each of we waists , and salute we with great affection , say , now , bless you both , the two dearest creature I have in the world ! well , say she , you will quite forget my fault about -- he stopt she before she could speak the name , and say , for ever forget it ! -- and , , I will forgive you too , if you do not again make my displeasure so light a thing to you , as you do just now . say my lady , she do not make you displeasure a light thing to she ; but the heavier it be , the higher compliment she make I , that she would bear it all , rather than not see you and I reconcile . no matter for that , say he : it be either a absence of thought , or a slight by implication , at least , that my niceness could not bear from she tenderness : for look it not presum , that she could stand my displeasure , or be sure of make she term when she please ? which , fond as I be of she , I assure she , will not be always , in wilful fault , in she power . , say my lady , I can tell you , , you have a gentleman here in my brother ; and you may expect such treatment from he , as that character , and he know good sense and breeding , will always oblige he to show : but if you offend , the have mercy upon you !-- you see how it be by poor I !-- and yet I never know he to forgive so soon . I be sure , say I , I will take care as much as I can ; for I have be frightene out of my wit , and have offended , before I know where I be . so happily do this storm blow over ; and my lady be quite subdued and pacified . when we come out of the garden , he chariot be ready ; and he say , well , sister , I have most assuredly go away towards my other house , if thing have not take this happy turn ; and , if you please , instead of it , you and I will take a airing : and pray , my dear , say he to I , bid Jewkes order supper by eight o'clock , and we shall then join you . , add he
he , to she nephew , will you take you horse and escort we ? I will , say he : and be glad , at my soul , to see you all so good friend . so my dear lord and master hande my lady into he chariot , and she kinsman and he servants rode after they and I go up to my closet to ruminate on these thing . and , foolish thing that I be , this poor run into my head !-- how soon the name and quality of a wife give one privileges , in one 's own account ! -- yet , methinks , I want to know more about she ; for , be it not strange , that I , who liv year in the family , should have hear nothing of this ? but I be so constantly with my lady , that I might the less hear of it ; for she , I dare say , never know it , or she would have tell I . but I dare not ask he about the poor lady . -- yet I wonder what become of she ! whether she be live ? and whether any thing come of it ?-- May be I shall hear full soon enough ! -- but I hope not to any bad purpose . as to the other unhappy case , I know it be talk of , that in he travels , before I be take into the family long , he have one or two broil ; and , from a youth , he be always remarkable for courage , and be reckon a great master of he sword . grant he may never be put to use it ! and that he may be always preserve in honour and safety ! about seven o'clock my master send word , that he would have I not expect he to supper ; for that he , and my lady he sister , and nephew , be prevail upon to stay with ; and that , and 's family , have promise to meet they there . I be glad they do not send for I ; and the rather , as I hope those good family be my friend , would confirm my lady a little in my favour ; and so I follow my writing closely . about eleven o'clock they return . I have but just come down , have tire myself with my pen , and be sit talking with and , whom I would , though unwillingly on they side , make sit down , which they do over against I . ask my pardon , in a good deal of confusion , for the part she have act against I ; say , that thing have be very differently represent to she ; and that she little thought I be married , and that she be behave so rudely to the lady of the house . I say , I take nothing amiss ; and very freely forgave she ; and hope my new condition would not make I forget how to behave properly to every one ; but that I must endeaavor to act not unworthy of it , for the honour of the gentleman who have so generously raise I to it . say , that my situation give I great opportunity of shew the excellence of my nature , that I could forgive offence against I so readily , as she , for she own part , must always , she say , acknowledge , with confusion of face . people , say I , , do not know how they shall act , when they will be in the power of they superior ; and I always think one should distinguish between act of malice , and of implicit obedience ; though , at the same time , a person should know how to judge between lawful and unlawful . and even the great , though at present angry they be not obey , will afterwards have no ill opinion of a person for withstand they in they unlawful command . seem a little concerned at this ; and I say , I speak chiefly from my own experience : for that I might say , as they both know my story , that I have not want both for menace and temptation ; and have I comply with the one , or be intimidate by the other , I should not have be what I be . ah , madam ! reply Jewkes , I never know any body like you ; and I think you temper sweeter , since the happy day , than before ; and that , if possible , you take less upon you . why , a good reason , say I , may be assign for that : I think myself in danger : I look upon every one as my enemy ; and it be impossible that I should not be fretful , uneasy , jealous . but when my dearest friend have take from I the ground of my uneasiness , and make I quite happy , I should have be very blamable , if I have not shew a satisfied and easy mind , and a temper that should engage every one 's respect and love at the same time , if possible : and so much the more , as it be but justify , in some sort , the honour I have receive : for the fewer enemie i make myself , the more I engage every one to think , that my good benefactor have be less to blame in descending as he have do . this way of talk pleas they both very much ; and they make I many compliment upon it , and wish I always to be
be happy , as , they say , I so well deserve . we be thus engage , when my master , and he sister and she nephew , come in : and they make I quite alive , in the happy humour in which they all return . the two woman would have withdraw : but my master say , do not go , : , pray stay ; I shall speak to you presently . so he come to I , and , salut I , say , well , my dear love , I hope I have not trespass upon you patience , by a absence longer than we design . but it have not be to you disadvantage ; for though we have not you company , we have talk of nobody else but you . my lady come up to I , and say , ay , child , you have be all we subject . I do not know how it be : but you have make two or three good family , in this neighbourhood , as much you admirer , as you friend here . my sister , say he , have be hear you praise , , from half a score mouth , with more pleasure than she heart will easily let she express . my good 's favour , say I , and the continuance of yours , sir , would give I more pride than that of all the rest of the world put together . well , child , say she , proud heart do not come down all at once ; though my brother , here , have this day set mine a good many peg lower than I ever know it : but I will say , I wish you joy with my brother ; and so kiss I . my dear lady , say I , you for ever oblige I !-- I shall now believe myself quite happy . this be all I want to make I so !-- and I hope I shall always , through my life , show you ladyship , that I have the most grateful and respectful sense of you goodness . but , child , say she , I shall not give you my company when you make you appearance . let you own merit make all you neighbour you friend , as it have do here , by you one ; and you will have no need of my countenance , nor any body 's else . now , say she nephew , ' ti my turn : I wish you joy with all my soul , madam ; and , by what I have see , and by what I have hear , ' fore , I think you have meet with no more than you deserve ; and so all the company say , where we have be : and pray forgive all my nonsense to you . , say I , I shall always , I hope , respect as I ought , so near a relation of my good and Lady Davers ; and I thank you for you kind compliment . , , say he , I believe you have some forgiveness too to ask ; for we be all to blame , to make madam , here , fly the pit , as she do . do we think we make she quit she own house . thou always , say my lady , sayest too much , or too little . say , I have be treat with so much goodness and condescension since you go , that I have be beforehand , sir , in ask pardon myself . so my lady sit down with I half a hour , and tell I , that she brother have carry she a fine airing , and have quite charme she with he kind treatment of she ; and have much confirm she in the good opinion she have begin to entertain of my discreet and oblige behaviour : but , continue she , when he would make I visit , without intend to stay , my old neighbour , ( for , say she , be nearest , we visit she first ; and she scrape all the rest of the company together , ) they be all so full of you praise , that I be quite borne down ; and , truly , it be among the prophet ! you may believe how much I be delighte with this ; and I spare not my due acknowledgment . when she ladyship take leave , to go to bed , she say , Goodnight to you , heartily , and to you good man . I kiss you when I come in , out of form ; but I now kiss you out of more than form , I will assure you . join with I , my dear parent , in my joy for this happy turn ; the contrary of which I so much dread , and be the only difficulty I have to labour with . this poor , I wonder what be become of she , poor soul ! I wish he would , of he own head , mention she again .-- not that I be very uneasy , neither . -- you will say , I must be a little saucy , if I be . my dear master give I a account , when we go up , of the pain he have take with he beloved sister , as he himself style she ; and of all the kind thing the good family have say in my behalf ; and that he observe she be not so much displease with hear they , as she be at first ; when she would not permit any body to speak of I as he
he wife : and that my health , as he spouse , be put ; when it come to she , she drank it ; but say , come , brother , here be you to you : but I shall not know how to stand this affair , when the Countess ----, and the young lady , come to visit I . one of these young lady be the person she be so fond of promote a match for , with she brother .-- , I know , she say , will rally I smartly upon it ; and you know , brother , she want neither wit nor satire . he say , I hope , , whenever she marry , will meet with a better husband than I should have make she ; for , in my conscience , I think I should hardly have make a tolerable one to any but . he tell I that they rally he on the stateliness of he temper ; and say , they see he would make a exceed good husband where he be ; but it must be owe to my meekness , more than to he complaisance ; for , say , I could see well enough , when you ladyship detain she , though he have but hint he desire of find she at we house , he be so out of humwe at she suppose noncompliance , that mine and my sister 's pity for she be much more engage , than we envy . ay , say my lady , he be too lordly a creature , by much ; and can not bear disappointment , nor ever could . say he , well , , you should not , of all persons , find fault with I ; for I bear a great deal from you , before I be at all angry . yes , reply she : but when I have go a little too far , as I own I do , you make I pay for it severely enough ! you know you do , sauce - box . and the poor thing too , add she , that I take with I for my advocate , so low have he bring I ! he treat she in such a manner as make my heart ache for she : but part be art , I know , to make I think the better of she . indeed , sister , say he , there be very little of that ; for , at that time , I care not what you think , nor have complaisance enough to have give a shilling for you good or bad opinion of she or I . and , I own , I be displease to be break in upon , after you provocation , by either of you and she must learn that lesson , never to come near I , when I be in those humours ; which shall be as little as possible : for , after a while , if let alone , I always come to myself , and be sorry for the violence of a temper , so like my dear sister 's here : and , for this reason think it be no matter how few witness I have of it 's intemperance , while it last ; especially since every witness , whether they merit it or not , as you see in my 's case , must be a sufferer by it , if , unsent for , they come in my way . he repeat the same lesson to I again , and enforce it and own , that he be angry with I in earnest , just then ; though more with himself , afterwards , for be so : but when , , say he , you want to transfer all my displeasure upon yourself , it be so much brave I with you merit , as if I must soon end my anger , if place there ; or it be make it so light to you , that I be truly displease : for , continue he , I can not bear that you should wish , on any occasion whatever , to have I angry with you , or not to value my displeasure as the heaviest misfortune that could befall you . but , sir , say I , you know , that what I do be to try to reconcile my lady ; and , as she herself observe , it be pay she a high regard . it be so , reply he ; but never think of make a compliment to she , or any body live , at my expense . besides , she have behave herself so intolerably , that I begin to think you have stoop too much , and more than I ought to permit my wife to do ; and act of meanness be what I can not endure in any body , but especially where I love : and as she have be guilty of a very signal one , I have much rather have renounce she at that time , than have be reconcile to she . , say I , I hope I shall always comport myself so , as not wilfully to disoblige you for the future ; and the rather do I hope this , as I be sure I shall want only to know you pleasure to obey it . but this instance shew I , that I may much offend , without design it in the least . now , , reply he , do not be too serious : I hope I sha not be a very tyrannical husband to you : yet do I not pretend to be perfect , or to be always govern by reason in my first transport
transport ; and I expect , from you affection , that you will bear with I when you find I wrong . I have no ungrateful spirit , and can , when cool , enter as impartially into myself as most man ; and then I be always kind and acknowledge , in proportion as I have be out of the way . but to convince you , my dear , continue he , of you fault , ( I mean , with regard to the impetuosity of my temper ; for there be no fault in you intention , that I acknowledge , ) I will observe only , that you meet , when you come to I , while I be so out of humour , a reception you do not expect , and a harsh word or two that you do not deserve . now , have you not break in upon I while my anger last , but stay till I have come to you , or send to desire you company , you would have see none of this ; but that affectionate behaviour , which I doubt not you will always merit , and I shall always take pleasure in express : and in this temper shall you always find a proper influence over I : but you must not suppose , whenever I be out of humwe , that , in oppose yourself to my passion , you oppose a proper butt to it ; but when you be so good , like the slender ree , to bend to the hurricane , rather than , like the sturdy oak , to resist it , you will always stand firm in my kind opinion , while a contrary conduct would uproot you , with all you excellency , from my soul . , say I , I will endeaavor to conform myself , in all thing , to you will . I make no doubt but you will : and I will endeaavor to make my will as conformable to reason as I can . and let I tell you , that this belief of you be one of the inducement I have have to marry at all : for nobody be more averse to this state than myself ; and , now we be upon this subject , I will tell you why I be so averse . we people of fortune , or such as be bear to large expectation , of both sex , be generally educated wrong . you have occasionally touch upon this , , several time in you journal , so justly , that I need say the less to you . we be usually so headstrong , so violent in we will , that we very little bear control . Humoure by we nurse , through the fault of we parent , we practise first upon they ; and show the gratitude of we disposition , in a insolence that ought rather to be check and restrain , than encourage . next , we be to be indulge in every thing at school ; and we master and mistress be reward with further grateful instance of we boisterous behaviour . but , in we wise parent ' eye , all look well , all be forgiven and excuse ; and for no other reason , but because we be theirs . we next progression be , we exercise we spirits , when bring home , to the torment and regret of we parent themselves , and torture they heart by we undutiful and perverse behaviour to they , which , however ungrateful in we , be but the natural consequence of they culpable indulgence to we , from infancy upward . and then , next , after we have , perhaps , half break they heart , a wife be look out for : convenience , or birth , or fortune , be the first motive , affection the last ( if it be at all consult ) : and two people thus educate , thus train up , in a course of unnatural ingratitude , and who have be headstrong torment to every one who have have a share in they education , as well as to those to whom they owe they being , be bring together ; and what can be expect , but that they should pursue , and carry on , the same comfortable conduct in matrimony , and join most heartily to plague one another ? and , in some measure , indeed , this be right ; because hereby they revenge the cause of all those who have be aggrieve and insult by they , upon one another . the gentleman have never be controlle : the lady have never be contradict . he can not bear it from one whose new relation , he think , should oblige she to show a quite contrary conduct . she think it very barbarous , now , for the first time , to be oppose in she will , and that by a man from whom she expect nothing but tenderness . so great be the difference between what they both expect from one another , and what they both find in each other , that no wonder misunderstanding happen ; that these ripen to quarrel ; that act of unkindness pass , which , even have the first motive to they union be affection , as usually it be not , would have efface all manner of tender impressions on both side . appeal to parent or guardians often ensue . if , by mediation of friend , a reconciliation take place , it hardly ever hold : for why ? the fault be in the minds of both , and neither of they will think so ; so that the wound ( not permit to be pro ) be but
but skin over , and rankle still at the bottom , and at last break out with more pain and anguish than before . separate bed be often the consequence ; perhaps elopement : if not , a unconquerable indifference , possibly aversion . and whenever , for appearance - sake , they be oblige to be together , every one see , that the yawning husband , and the vapourish wife , be truly insupportable to one another ; but separate , have freer spirits , and can be tolerable company . now , my dear , I would have you think , and I hope you will have no other reason , that have I marry the first lady in the land , I would not have treat she better than I will my . for my wife be my wife ; and I be the longer in resolve on the state , because I know its requisite , and doubt my conduct in it . I believe I be more nice than many gentleman ; but it be because I have be a close observer of the behaviour of wedde folk , and hardly ever have see it to be such as I could like in my own case . I shall , possibly , give you instance of a more particular nature of this , as we be longer , and , perhaps , I might say , better acquaint . have I marry with the view of many gentleman , and with such as my good sister ( supply the place of my father and mother , ) would have recommend , I have wed a fine lady , bring up pretty much in my own manner , and use to have she will in every thing . some gentleman can come into a compromise ; and , after a few struggle , sit down tolerably contente . but , have I marry a princess , I could not have do so . I must have love she exceedingly well , before I have consent to knit the knot with she , and prefer she to all she sex ; for without this , , indifference , if not disgust , will arise in every wedded life , that could not have make I happy at home ; and there be fewer instance , I believe , of man 's love better , after matrimony , than of woman 's ; the reason of which 'tis not my present purpose to account for . then I must have be morally sure , that she preferre I to all man ; and , to convince I of this , she must have lessen , not aggravate , my failings : she must have borne with my imperfection ; she must have watch and study my temper ; and if ever she have any point to carry , any desire of overcoming , it must have be by sweetness and complaisance ; and yet not such a slavish one , as should make she condescension seem to be rather the effect of she insensibility , than judgment or affection . she should not have give cause for any part of my conduct to she to wear the least aspect of compulsion or force . the word command , on my side , or obedience on hers , I would have blot from my vocabulary . for this reason I should have think it my duty to have desire nothing of she , that be not significant , reasonable , or just ; and that then she should , on hers , have shewn no reluctance , uneasiness , or doubt , to oblige I , even at half a word . I would not have excuse she to let I twice enjoin the same thing , while I take so much care to make she compliance with I reasonable , and such as should not destroy she own free agency , in point that ought to be allow she : and if I be not always right , that yet she would bear with I , if she see I set upon it ; and expostulate with I on the right side of compliance ; for that would show I , ( suppose small point in dispute , from which the greatest quarrel , among friend , generally arise , ) that she differ from I , not for contradiction - sake , but desire to convince I for my own ; and that I should , another time , take better resolution . this would be so oblige a conduct , that I should , in justice , have double my esteem for one , who , to humour I , could give up she own judgment ; and I should see she could have no other view in she expostulation , after she compliance have pass , than to rectify my motion for the future ; and it would have be impossible then , but I must have pay the greater deference to she opinion and advice in more momentous matters . in all company she must have shewn , that she have , whether I deserv it altogether or not , a high regard and opinion of I ; and this the rather , as such a conduct in she would be a reputation and security to herself : for if we rake attempt a married lady , we first encouragement , exclusive of we own vanity , arise from the indifferent opinion , slight , or contempt , she express of she husband . I should expect , therefore , that she should draw a kind veil over my fault ; that such as she could not hide , she would extenuate ; that she would place my better action in a advantageous light , and shew that I have she good opinion ,
, at least , whatever libertie the world took with my character . she must have value my friend for my sake ; be cheerful and easy , whomsoever I have bring home with I ; and , whatever fault she have observe in I , have never blame I before company ; at least , with such a air of superiority , as should have shewn she have a better opinion of she own judgment , than of mine . now , my , this be but a faint sketch of the conduct I must have expect from my wife , let she quality have be what it would ; or have live with she on bad term . judge then , if to I a lady of the modish taste could have be tolerable . the perverseness and contradiction I have too often see , in some of my visit , even among people of sense , as well as condition , have prejudice I to the marry state ; and , as I know I could not bear it , surely I be in the right to decline it : and you see , my dear , that I have not go among this class of people for a wife ; nor know I , indeed , where , in any class , I could have seek one , or have one suitable to my mind , if not you : for here be my misfortune ; I could not have be contente to have be but moderately happy in a wife . judge you , from all this , if I could very well bear that you should think yourself so well secure of my affection , that you could take the fault of other upon yourself ; and , by a suppose supererogatory merit , think you interposition sufficient to ato for the fault of other . yet be I not perfect myself : no , I be greatly imperfect . yet will I not allow , that my imperfection shall excuse those of my wife , or make she think I ought to bear fault in she , that she can rectify , because she bear greater from I . upon the whole , I may expect , that you will bear with I , and study my temper , till , and only till , you see I be capable of return insult for obligation ; and till you think , that I shall be of a gentler deportment , if I be roughly use , than otherwise . one thing more I will add , that I should scorn myself , if there be one privilege of you sex , that a princess might expect , as my wife , to be indulge in , that I would not allow to my ; for you be the wife of my affections : I never wish for one before you , nor ever do I hope to have another . I hope , sy , say I , my future conduct -- pardon I , say he , my dear , for interrupt you ; but it be to assure you , that I be so well convince of you affectionate regard for I , that I know I might have spare the greatest part of what I have say : and , indeed , it must be very bad for both of we , if I should have reason to think it necessary to say so much . but one thing have brotch on another ; and I have rather speak what my niceness have make I observe in other family , than what I fear in my own . and , therefore , let I assure you , I be thoroughly satisfied with you conduct hithertoo . you shall have no occasion to repent it : and you shall find , though greatly imperfect , and passionate , on particular provocation , ( which yet I will try to overcome , ) that you have not a brutal or ungenerous husband , who be capable of offer insult for condescension , or return evil for good . I thank he for these kind rule , and generous assurance : and assure he , that they have make so much impression on my mind , that these , and he most agreeable injunction before give I , and such as he should hereafter be pleased to give I , should be so many rule for my future behaviour . and I be glad of the method I have take of make a of all that pass in these first stage of my happiness , because it will sink the impression still deeper ; and I shall have recourse to they for my better regulation , as often as I shall mistrust my memory . let I see : what be the rule I be to observe from this awful lecture ? why these : 1 . that I must not , when he be in great wrath with any body , break in upon he without he leave . well , I will remember it , I warrant . but yet I think this rule be almost peculiar to himself . 2 . that I must think he displeasure the heaviest thing that can befall I . to be sure I shall . 3 . and so that I must not wish to incur it , to save any body else . I will be further if I do . 4 . that I must never make a compliment to any body at he expense . 5 . that I must not be guilty of any act of wilful meanness . there be a great deal mean in this ; and I will endeaavor to observe it all . to be sure , the occasion on which he mention this , explain it
it ; that I must say nothing , though in anger , that be spiteful or malicious ; that be disrespectful or undutiful , and such - like . 6 . that I must bear with he , even when I find he in the wrong . this be a little hard , as the case may be ! I wonder whether poor be live or dead ! 7 . that I must be as flexible as the reed in the fable , lest , by resist the tempest , like the oak , I be tear up by the root . well , I will do the best I can !-- there be no great likelihood , I hope , that I should be too perverse ; yet sure , the tempest will not lay I quite level with the ground , neither . 8 . that the education of young people of condition be generally wrong . ; that if any part of child 's education fall to my lot , I never indulge and humour they in thing that they ought to be restrain in . 9 . that I accustom they to bear disappointment and control . 10 . that I suffer they not to be too much indulge in they infancy . 11 . nor at school . 12 . spoil they when they come home . 13 . for that child generally extend they perverseness from the nurse to the schoolmaster : from the schoolmaster to the parent : 14 . and , in they next step , as a proper punishment for all , make they ownself unhappy . 15 . that undutiful and perverse child make bad husband and wife : and , collaterally , bad master and mistress . 16 . that , not be subject to be controlle early , they cannot , when married , bear one another . 17 . that the fault lie deep , and in the mind of each other , neither will mmend it . 18 . Whence follow misunderstanding , quarrel , appeal , ineffectual reconciliation , separation , elopement ; or , at best , indifference ; perhaps , aversion .--Memorandum ; a good image of unhappy wedlock , in the word , and , when together : but separate , both quite alive . 19 . few marry person behave as he like . let I ponder this with awe and improvement 20 . some gentleman can compromise with they wife , for quietness sake ; but he can not . indeed I believe that be true ; I do not desire he should . 21 . that love before marriage be absolutely necessary . 22 . that there be fewer instance of man 's than woman 's love better after marriage . but why so ? I wish he have give he reason for this ! I fancy they would not have be to the advantage of he own sex . 23 . that a woman give she husband reason to think she prefer he before all man . well , to be sure this should be so . 24 . that if she would overcome , it must be by sweetness and complaisance ; that be , by yielding , he mean , no doubt. 25 . yet not such a slavish one neither , as should rather seem the effect of she insensibility , than judgment or affection . 26 . that the word Command and obey shall be blot out of the . very good ! 27 . that a man should desire nothing of he wife , but what be significant , reasonable , just . to be sure , that be right 28 . but then , that she must not show reluctance , uneasiness , or doubt , to oblige he ; and that too at half a word ; and must not be bid twice to do one thing . but may not there be some occasion , where this may be a little dispense with ? but he say afterwards , indeed , 29 . that this must be only while he take care to make she compliance reasonable , and consistent with she free agency , in point that ought to be allow she . come , this be pretty well , consider . 30 . that if the husband be set upon a wrong thing , she must not dispute with he , but do it and , expostulate afterwards . good sir ! I do not know what to say to this ! it look a little hard , methink ! this would bear a smart debate , I fancy , in a parliament of woman . but then he say , 31 . Suppose they be only small point that be in dispute . well , this mend it a little . for small point , I think , should not be stand upon . 32 . that the greatest quarrel among friend ( and wife and husband be , or should be , friend ) arise from small matter . I believe this be very true ; for I have like to have have anger here , when I intend very well . 33 . that a wife should not desire to convince she husband for Contradiction sake , but for this own . as both will find they account in this , if one do , I believe ' tis very just . 34 . that in all company a wife must show respect and love to she husband . 35 . and this for the sake of she own reputation and security ; for , 36 . that rake can not have a greater encouragement to attempt a married lady 's virtue , than she slight opinion of she husband . to be sure this stand to reason , and be a fine lesson . 37
37 . that a wife should therefore draw a kind veil over she husband 's fault . 38 . that such as she could not conceal , she should extenuate . 39 . that he virtue she should place in a advantageous light 40 . and show the world , that he have her good opinion at least. 41 . that she must value he friend for he sake . 42 . that she must be cheerful and easy in she behaviour , to whomsoever he bring home with he . 43 . that whatever fault she see in he , she never blame he before company . 44 . at least , with such a air of superiority , as if she have a less opinion of he judgment than she own . 45 . that a man of nice observation can not be contente to be only moderately happy in a wife . 46 . that a wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory merit to herself ; so as to take the fault of other upon she . indeed , I think it be well if we can bear we own ! this be of the same nature with the third ; and touch upon I , on the present occasion , for this wholesome lecture . 47 . that he imperfection must not be a plea for hers . to be sure , ' ti no matter how good the woman be ; but ' ti to be hope man will allow a little . but , indeed , he say , 48 . that a husband , who expect all this , be to be incapable of return insult for obligation , or evil for good ; and ought not to abridge she of any privilege of she sex . well , my dear parent , I think this last rule crown the rest , and make they all very tolerable ; and a generous man , and a man of sense , can not be too much oblige . and , as I have this happiness , I shall be very unworthy , if I do not always so think , and so act . yet , after all , you will see I have not the easiest task in the world . but I know my own intention , that I shall not wilfully err ; and so fear the less . not one hint do he give , that I durst lay hold of , about poor . I wish my lady have not speak of it : for it have give I a curiosity that be not quite so pretty in I ; especially so early in my nuptial , and in a case so long ago past . yet he intimate too , to he sister , that he have have other fault , ( of this sort , I suppose , ) that have not come to she knowledge ! -- but I make no doubt he have see he error , and will be very good for the future . I wish it , and pray it may be so , for he own dear sake ! , the seventh . when I arise in the morning , I go to wait on Lady Davers , see she door open ; and she be in bed , but awake , and talk to she woman . I say , I hope I do not disturb you ladyship . not at all , say she ; I be glad to see you . how do you do ? well , add she , when do you set out for ?-- I say , I can not tell , madam ; it be design as to - day , but I have hear no more of it . sit down , say she , on the bed - side .-- I find , by the talk we have yesterday and last night , you have have but a poor time of it , , ( I must call you so yet , say she , ) since you be bring to this house , till within these few day . and too have give such a account , as make I pity you . indeed , madam , say I , if you ladyship know all , you would pity I ; for never poor creature be so hard put to it . but I ought to forget it all now , and be thankful . why , say she , as far as I can find , ' ti a mercy you be here now . I be sadly move with some part of you story and you have really make a noble defence , and deserve the praise of all we sex . it be enable I , madam , reply I . why , say she , ' ti the more extraordinary , because I believe , if the truth be know , you love the wretch not a little . while my trials last , madam , say I , I have not a thought of any thing , but to preserve my innocence , much less of love . but , tell I truly , say she , do you not love he all the time ? I have always , madam , answer I , a great reverence for my master , and think all he good action doubly good and for he naughty one , though I abhor he attempt upon I , yet I could not hate he ; and always wish he well ; but I do not know that it be love . indeed I have not the presumption . sweet girl ! say she ; that be prettily say : but when he find he could not gain he end , and begin to be sorry for you suffering ,
, and to admire you virtue , and to profess honourable love to you , what do you think ? think ! indeed , madam , I do not know what to think ! could neither hope nor believe so great a honour would fall to my lot , and fear more from he kindness , for some time , than I have do from he unkindness : and , have have a private intimation , from a kind friend , of a sham marriage , intend by means of a man who be to personate a minister , it keep my mind in too much suspense , to be greatly overjoy at he kind declaration . say she , I think he do make two or three attempt upon you in ? yes , madam , say I ; he be very naughty , to be sure . and here he propose article to you , I understand ? yes , madam , reply I ; but I abhor so much the thought of be a keep creature , that I reject they with great boldness ; and be resolve to die before I would consent to they . he afterwards attempt you , I think : do he not ? o yes , madam , say I , a most sad attempt he make ! and I have like to have be lose ; for be not so good as she should have be . and so I tell she ladyship that sad affair , and how I fall into fit ; and that they believe I die , forbore .-- any attempt after this base one ? she say . he be not so good as he should have be , return I , once in the garden , afterwards ; but I be so watchful , and so ready to take the alarm ! but , say she , do he not threaten you , at time , and put on he stern air , every now and then ?-- threaten , madam , reply I ; yes , I have enough of that ! I think I should have die for fear several time .-- how could you bear that ? say she : for he be a most daring and majestic mortal ! he have none of you puny heart , but be as courageous as a lion ; and , boy and man , never fear any thing . I myself , say she , have a pretty good spirit ; but , when I have make he truly angry , I have always be force to make it up with he , as well as I could : for , child , he be not one that be easily reconcile , I assure you . but , after he have profess honourable love to you , do he never attempt you again ?-- no , indeed , madam , he do not . but he be a good while struggle with himself , and with he pride , as he be pleased to call it , before he could stoop so low ; and consider , and consider again : and once , upon my say but two or three word , that displease he , when he be very kind to I , he turn I out of door , in a manner , at a hour 's warning ; for he send I above a day 's journey towards my father 's ; and then send a man and horse , post -haste , to fetch I back again ; and have be exceedingly kind and gracious to I ever since , and make I happy . that send you away , say she , one hour , and send after you the next , be exactly like my brother ; and ' tis well if he do not turn you off twice or thrice before a year come about , if you vex he : and he would have do the same by the first lady in the land , if he have be marry to she . yet have he he virtue , as well as he fault ; for he be generous ; nay , he be noble in he spirit ; hate little dirty action : he delight in do good ; but do not pass over a wilful fault easily . he be wise , prudent , sober , and magnanimous , and will not tell a lie , nor disguise he fault ; but you must not expect to have he all to yourself , I doubt . but I will no more harp upon this string : you see how he be exasperate at I ; and he seem to be angry at you too ; though something of it be art , I believe . indeed , madam , say I , he have be pleased to give I a most noble lecture ; and I find he be angry with I in earnest , and that it will not be a easy task to behave unexceptionably to he : for he be very nice and delicate in he notion , I perceive ; but yet , as you ladyship say , exceed generous . well , say she , I be glad thou hadst a little bit of he anger ; else I should have think it art ; and I do not love to be treat with low art , any more than he ; and I should have be vex if he have do it by I . but I understand , child , say she , that you keep a journal of all matters that pass , and he have several time find mean to get at it : should you care I should see it ? it could not be to you disadvantage ; for I find it
it have no small weight with he in you favour ; and I should take great pleasure to read all he stratagem , attempt , contrivance , menace , and offer to you , on one hand , and all you pretty counter - plotting , which he much praise ; you resolute resistance , and the noble stand you have make to preserve you virtue ; and the step by which he pride be subdue , and he mind induce to honourable love , till you be make what you now be : for it must be a rare and uncommon story ; and will not only give I great pleasure in reading , but will entirely reconcile I to the step he have take : and that , let I tell you , be what I never think to be ; for I have go a great way in bring about a match with he and -- ; and have say so much of it , that the earl , she father , approve of it : and so do the of ----, she uncle ; and herself be not averse : and now I shall be hunt to death about it ; and this have make I so outrageous as you have see I upon the matter . but when I can find , by you writings , that you virtue be but suitably reward , it will be not only a good excuse for I , but for he , and make I love you . there be nothing that I would not do , say I , to oblige you ladyship ; but my poor father and mother ( who would rather have see I bury quick in the earth , than to be seduce by the greatest of prince ) have they in they hand at present ; and you dear brother have bespeak they , when they have do read they : but , if he give I leave , I will show they to you ladyship , with all my heart ; not doubt you generous allowances , as I have have he ; though I have treat he very freely all the way , while he have naughty view ; and that you ladyship would consider they as the naked sentiment of my heart , from time to time deliver to those , whose indulgence I be sure of ; and for whose sight only they be write . give I a kiss now , say she ladyship , for you cheerful compliance : for I make no doubt my brother will consent I shall see they , because they must need make for you honour ; and I see he love you better than any one in the world . I have hear , continue she ladyship , a mighty good character of you parent , as industrious , honest , sensible , good folk , who know the world ; and , as I doubt not my brother 's generosity , I be glad they will make no ill figure in the world 's eye . , say I , they be the honestest , the lovingest , and the most conscientious couple breathing . they once live creditably ; and bring up a great family , of which I be the youngest ; but have misfortune , through they do beyond they power for two unhappy brothers , who be both dead , and whose debt they stand bound for ; and so become reduced , and , by harsh creditor , ( where most of the debt be , not of they own contracting , ) turn out of all ; and have , without success , try to set up a little country - school ; ( for my father understand a little of account , and write a pretty good hand ;) force to take to hard labour ; but honest all the time ; contente ; never repin ; and love to one another ; and , in the midst of they poverty and disappointment , above all temptation ; and all they fear be , that I should be wick , and yield to temptation for the sake of worldly riche and to 's , and they good lesson , and those I imbibe from my dear good lady , you ladyship 's mother , it be that I owe the preservation of my innocence , -- and the happy station I be exalt to . she be pleased to kiss I again , and say , there be such a noble simplicity in thy story , such a honest artlessness in thy mind , and such a sweet humility in thy deportment , notwithstand thy present station , that I believe I shall be force to love thee , whether I will or not : and the sight of you papers , I dare say , will cry the work ; will disarm my pride , banish my resentment on 's account , and justify my brother 's conduct ; and , at the same time , redound to you own everlasting honour , as well as to the credit of we sex : and so I make no doubt but my brother will let I see they . , say my lady , I can say any thing before you ; and you will take no notice of we conversation ; but I see you be much touch with it : do you ever hear any thing prettier , more unaffected , sincere , free , easy ?-- no , never , madam , answer she , in my life ; and it be a great pleasure to see so happy a reconciliation take place , where there be so much merit . I say , I have discover so much prudence in , that , as well for that , as
as for the confidence you ladyship place in she , I have make no scruple of speak my mind freely before she ; and of blame my dear master while he be blameworthy , as well as acknowledge he transcendent goodness to I since ; which , I be sure , exceed all I can ever deserve . may be not , say my lady ; I hope you will be very happy in one another ; and I will now rise , and tell he my thought , and ask he to let I have the reading of you papers ; for I promise myself much pleasure in they ; and shall not grudge a journey and a visit to you , to the other house , to fetch they . you ladyship 's favour , say I , be all I have to wish for ; and if I have that , and the continuance of you dear brother 's goodness to I , I shall be easy under whatever else may happen . and so I take my leave , and withdrew ; and she let I hear she say to , ' Tis a charme creature , !-- I know not which excel ; she person , or she mind !-- and so yong a creature too !-- well may my brother love she ! I be afraid , my dear father and mother , I shall now be too proud indeed . I have once a good mind to have ask she ladyship about ; but I think it be better let alone , since she do not mention it herself . may be I shall hear it too soon . but I hope not . I wonder , though , whether she be liive or dead . we breakfaste together with great good temper ; and my lady be very kind , and , ask my good master , he give leave very readily , she should see all my papers , when you return they to I ; and he say , he be sure , when she come to read they , she would say , that I have well deserve the fortune I have meet with : and would be of opinion , that all the kindness of he future life would hardly be a sufficient reward for my virtue , and make I amend for my suffering . my lady resolve to set out the next morning to return to she lord , my master order every thing to be make ready for he do the like to ; and this even we good neighbour will sup with we , to take leave of my lady and we . night . nothing particular have pass at dinner or supper , but the most condescending goodness , on my lady 's side , to I ; and the highest civility from 's family , from , from 's family , etc. and reciprocal good wish all around ; and a promise obtain from my benefactor , that he would endeaavor to pass a fortnight or three week in these part , before the winter set in ; I shall conclude this day with observing , that I dispose of the money my master be so good to put into my hand , in the manner he be pleased to direct ; and I give Jewke hers in such a manner as highly please she ; and she wish I , with tear , all kind of happiness ; and praye I to forgive she all she wickedness to I , as she herself call it . I beg leave of my master to present with five guinea for a pair of glove ; which he say be well think of . I should have mention , that and I agree upon a correspondence , which will be no small pleasure to I ; for she be a admirable young lady , whom I prefer to every one I have see ; and I shall , I make no doubt , improve by she letter ; for she be say to have a happy talent in writing , and be well read , for so young a lady . . on mor my lady set out for she own seat ; and my best friend and I , attend by , , and , for this dear house . she ladyship parte with she brother and I with great tenderness , and make I promise to send she my papers ; which I find she intend to entertain with , and another lady or two , she intimate , as also she lord ; and hope to find , as I believe , in the reading of they , some excuse for she brother 's choice . my dearest master have be all love and tenderness on the road , as he be in every place , and on every occasion . and oh , what a delightful change be this journey , to that which , so contrary to all my wish , and so much to my apprehension , carry I hence to the house ! and how do I bless at every turn , and at every stage ! we do not arrive here till yesterday noon . ride before , to let they know we be come : and I have the satisfaction to find every body there I wish to see . when the chariot enter the court - yard , I be so strongly impressed with the favour and mercy of , on remember how I be send away the last time I see this house ; the leave I take ; the dangers I have encounter ; a poor cast - off servant girl ; and now return a joyful wife , and the mistress , through he favour , of the noble house I be
be turn out of ; that I be hardly able to support the joy I feel in my mind on the occasion . he see how much I be move , and tenderly ask I , why I seem so affect ? I tell he , and lift he dear hand to my lip , and say , of sy ! 's mercy , and you goodness to I on enter this dear , dear place , be above my expression ; I can hardly bear the thought of they ! -- he say , welcome , thrice welcome , joy of my life ! to you own house ; and kiss my hand in return . all the common servant stood at the window , as unseen as they could , to observe we . he take my hand , with the most condescending goodness in the world ; and , with great complaisance , lead I into the parlour , and kiss I with the greatest ardour . welcome again , my dearest life ! say he , a thousand time welcome to the possession of a house that be not more mine than yours ! I throw myself at he foot : permit I , dear sir , thus to bless , and thank you , for all he mercy and you goodness . of may I so behave , as not to be utterly unworthy ; and then how happy shall I be ! give I , my dearest , say he , life and health to reward all you sweetness ! and no man can be so blest as I . where ( say he to , who pass by the door ) , where be ?-- she bolt in : here , good sir ! say she ; here , good madam ! be I , wait impatiently , till call for , to congratulate you both .-- I run to she , and clasp my arm about she neck , and kiss she ; of my dear ! say I , my other dear mother ! receive you happy , happy Pamela ; and join with I to bless , and bless we master , for all these great thing !-- I be ready to sink in she arm through excess of joy , to see the dear good woman , who have be so often a mournful witness of my distress , as now of my triumph .-- Dearest madam , say she , you do I too much honour . let my whole life show the joy I take in you deserv good fortune , and in my duty to you , for the early instance I receive of you goodness in you kind letter . of ! reply I , there all thanks be due , both from you and I : for we dear master grant I this blessing , as I may justly call it , the very first moment I beg it of he . you goodness , sir , say she , I will for ever acknowledge ; and I beg pardon for the wrong step I make in apply to my .-- he be so good as to salute she , and say , all be over now , ; and I shall not remember you ever disoblige I . I always respecte you , and shall now more and more value you , for the sake of that dear good creature , whom , with joy unfeigned , I can call my wife . bless you honour for ever ! say she ; and many many happy year may ye live together , the envy and wonder of all who know you ! but where , say my dear master , be honest ? and where be ? -- , , say I , you shall show I they , and all the good folk , presently ; and let I go up with you to behold the dear apartment , which I have see before with such different emotion to what I shall now do . we go up ; and in every room , the chamber I take refuge in , when my master pursue I , my lady 's chamber , she dress - room , 's room , not forget she closet , my own little bed - chamber , the green - room , and in each of the other , I bless for my past escape , and present happiness ; and the good woman be quite affect with the zeal and pleasure with which i make my thankful acknowledgment to the divine goodness . of my excellent lady ! say she , you be still the same good , pious , humble soul I know you ; and you marriage have add to you graces , as I hope it will to you blessing . dear , say I , you know not what I have go through ! you know not what have do for I ! you know not what a happy creature I be now ! I have a thousand thousand thing to tell you ; and a whole week will be too little , every moment of it spend in relating to you what have befall I , to make you acquaint with it all . we shall be sweetly happy together , I make no doubt . but I charge you , my dear , whatever you call I before stranger , that when we be by ourselves you call I nothing but you Pamela . for what a ungrateful creature should I be , who have receive so many mercy , if I attribute they not to the divine goodness , but assume to myself insolent air upon they ! no , I hope I shall be , more and more thankful , as I be more and more blest ! and
and more humble , as , the author of all my happiness , shall more distinguish I . we go down again to the parlour , to my dear master . say he , call in again ; he long to see you , my dear . he come in : bless you , my sweet lady , say he ; as now , be praise , I may call you ! do I not tell you , madam , that Providence would find you out ? o , , say I , be praise for all he mercy ! I be rejoice to see you ; and I lay my hand on he , and say , , how do you do ?-- I must always value you ; and you do not know how much of my present happiness I owe to the sheet of paper , and pens and ink , you furnish I with .

I be glad to see you .-- you look as well as ever , thank ! o , dear madam ! say he , better than ever , to have such a blessed sight ! bless you and my good master !-- and I hope , sy , say he , you will excuse all my past failings . ay , that I will , , say he ; because you never have any , but what you regard for my dear wife here be the occasion of . and now I can tell you , you can never err , because you can not respect she too much . of sir , say he , you honour be exceed good ! I be sure I shall always pray for you both . after dinner , come in , and talk of some affair under he care , he say afterwards , all you honour 's servants be now happy ; for , who leave you , have a pretty little fortune fallen to he , or he never would have quit you service . he be here but yesterday , to inquire when you and my lady return hither ; and hope he might have leave to pay he duty to you both . ay , say my master , I shall be glad to see honest ; for that be another of you favourite , . it be high time , I think , I should marry you , be it but to engage the respects of all my family to myself .-- there be , sy , say I , ten thousand reason why I should rejoice in you goodness . but I be go to say , say , that all you honour 's old servants be now happy , but one . you mean ? say my master . I do , indeed , say he , if you will excuse I , sir . o , say I , I have have my prayer for poor answer , as favourably as I could wish .-- why , say

stair , and give I possession of my lady 's dressing - room and cabinet , and she fine repeating - watch and equipage ; and , in short , of a complete set of diamonds , that be he good mother 's ; as also of the two pair of diamond ear - ring , the two diamond ring , and diamond necklace , he mention in he naughty article , which she ladyship have intend for present to , a rich heiress , that be propose for he wife , when he be just come from he travels ; but which go off , after all be agree upon on both the friend 's side , because he approve not she conversation ; and she have , as he tell he mother , too masculine a air ; and he never could be bring to see she but once , though the lady like he very well . he present I also with she ladyship 's book , picture , linen , lace , etc. that be in she apartment ; and bid I call those apartment mine . o give I , my good ! humility and gratitude . night . this day , as matter could not be ready for we appearance at a better place , we stay at home ; and my dear master employ himself a good deal in he library : and I have be take up pretty much , I hope , as I ought to be , in thankfulness , prayer and meditation , in my newly - present closet and I hope will be pleased to give a blessing to I ; for I have the pleasure to think I be not puffe up with this great alteration ; and yet be I not want to look upon all these favour and blessing in the light wherein I ought to receive they , both at the hand of , and my dear benefactor . we dine together with great pleasure ; and I have , in every word and action , all the instance of kindness and affection that the most indulged heart could wish . he say he would return to he closet again ; and at five o'clock would come and take a walk with I in the garden : and so retir as soon as he have dine , and I go up to mine . about six , he be pleased to come up to I , and say , now , my dear , I will attend you for a little walk in the garden ; and I give he my hand with great pleasure . this garden be much better cultivate than the one ; but that be larger , and have nobler walk in it ; and yet there be a pretty canal in this , and a fountain and cascade . we have a deal of sweet conversation as we walk ; and , after we have take a turn round , I bend towards the little garden ; and when I come near the summer - house , take the opportunity to slip from he , and just whipt up the step of this once frightful place , and knee down , and say , I bless thee , of ! for my escape , and for thy mercy ! o let I always possess a grateful , humble heart ! and I whipt down again and join he ; and he hardly miss I . of the neighbour gentry send they compliment to he on he return , but not a word about he marriage ; particularly , , , and of the . . I have a good deal of employment in choosing patterns for my new clothes . he think nothing too good ; but I think every thing I see be ; and he be so kind to pick out six of the richest for I to choose three suit out of , say , we would furnish ourselves with more in town , when we go thither . one be white , flower with silver most richly ; and he be pleased to say , that , as I be a bride , I should make my appearance in that the follow . and so we shall have in two or three day , from several place , nothing but mantua - maker and tailor at work . bless I ! what a chargeable and what a worthless hussy I be to the dear gentleman ! -- but he fortune and station require a great deal of it ; and he value for I will not let he do less , than if he have marry a fortune equal to he own : and then , as he say , it would be a reflection upon he , if he do .-- and so I doubt it will be , as it be : for either way the world will have something to say . he make I also choose some very fine lace , and linen ; and have send a message on purpose , with he order , to hasten all down , what can be do in town , as the millinery matter , etc. to be complete there , and send by particular messenger , as do . all to be here , and finish by afternoon , without fail . I send away this morning , with some more of my papers to you , and with the few he will give you separate . my desire be , that you will send I all the papers you have do with , that I may keep my word with Lady Davers ; to beg the continuance of you prayer and blessing ; to hope you will give I you answer about my dear benefactor 's proposal of the farm ; to
to beg you to buy , two suit of clothes each ; of the finest cloth for you , my dear father ; and of a creditable silk for my dear mother ; and good linen , and every thing answerable ; and that you will , as my best friend bid I say , let we see you here as soon as possible ; and he will have he chariot come for you , when you tell the day . oh ! how I long to see you both , my dear good parent , and to share with you my felicity ! you will have , I be sure , the goodness to go to all you creditor , which be chiefly those of my poor unhappy brothers , and get a account of all you be bound for ; and every one shall be pay to the utmost farthing , and interest beside , though some of they have be very cruel and unrelenting . -- but they be entitle to they own , and shall be thankfully pay . now I think of it , shall take my papers down to this place ; that you may have something to amuse you , of you dear child 's , instead of those you part with ; and I will continue write till I be settle , and you be determine ; and then I shall apply myself to the duty of the family , in order to become as useful to my dear benefactor , as my small ability will let I . if you think a couple of guinea will be of use to , who , I doubt , have not much aforehand , pray give they to she , from I , ( and I will return they to you , ) as for a pair of glove on my nuptial : and look through you poor acquaintance and neighbour , and let I have a list of such honest industrious poor , as may be true object of charity , and have no other assistance ; particularly such as be blind , lame , or sickly , with they several case ; and also such poor family and housekeeper as be reduce by misfortune , as ours be , and where a great number of child may keep they from rise to a state of tolerable comfort : and I will choose as well as I can ; for I long to be make a beginning , with the kind quarterly benevolence my dear good benefactor have bestow upon I for such good purpose . I be resolve to keep account of all these matters , and have already furnish I with a vellum book of white paper ; some side of which I hope soon to fill with the name of proper object : and though my dear master have give I all this without account , yet shall he see ( but nobody else ) how I lay it out , from quarter to quarter ; and I will , if any be leave , carry it on , like a accomptant , to the next quarter , and strike a balance four time a year , and a general balance at every year 's end .-- and I have write in it , for ; and lock it up safe in my newly - present cabinet . I intend to let see no farther of my papers , than to she own angry letter to she brother ; for I would not have she see my reflection upon it ; and she will know , down to that place , all that be necessary for she curiosity , as to my suffering , and the stratagem use against I , and the honest part I have be enable to act : and I hope , when she have read they all , she will be quite reconcile : for she will see it be all 's doings ; and that a gentleman of he part and knowledge be not to be draw in by such a poor young body as I . I will detain no longer . he will tell you to read this last part first , and while he stay . and so , with my humble duty to you both , and my dear ---- 's kind remembrance , I rest you ever- dutiful and gratefully happy Daughter . evening . Honoured Father and mother ! I will now proceed with my journal . on morning , my dear sir rode out , and bring with he to dinner , of the , and , and , and one ; and he steep up to I , and say he have ride out too far to return to breakfast ; but he have bring with he some of he old acquaintance , to dine with I . be you sorry for it , ? say he . I remembe he lesson , and say no , sure , sir ; I can not be angry at any thing you be pleased to do . say he , you know 's character , and have severely censure he in one of you letter , as one of my brother rake , and for he three lyings - in . he then give I the follow account , how he come to bring they . say he , 'I meet they all at 's ; and he lady ask I , if I be really married ? I say , yes , really . and to whom ? say . why , reply I , bluntly , to my mother 's waiting - maid . they could not tell what to say to I hereupon , and look one upon another . and I see I have spoil a jest , from each . say , you have
have , indeed , sir , a charming creature , as ever I see ; and she have mighty good luck . ay , say I , and so have I . but I shall say the less , because a man never do any thing of this nature , that he do not think he ought , if it be but in policy , to make the best of it . , say , if you have sinn , it be with you eye open : for you know the world as well as any gentleman of you year in it . ' ' why , really , gentlemen , say I , I should be glad to please all my friend ; but I can not expect , till they know my motives and inducement , that it will be so immediately . but I do assure you , I be exceedingly please myself ; and that , you know , be most to the purpose . ' ' , I have hear my wife praise you spouse that be , so much for person and beauty , that I want to see she of all thing . why , reply I , if you will all go and take a dinner with I , you shall see she with all my heart . and , , will you bear we company ? no , indeed , sir , say she . what , I will warrant , my wife will not be able to reconcile you to my mother 's waiting - maid ; be not that it ? truth , . , say she , I sha not be backward to pay you spouse a visit , in company of the neighbour lady ; but for one single woman to go , on such a sudden motion too , with so many gentleman , be not right . but that need not hinder you , gentlemen . so , say he , the rest send , that they should not dine at home ; and they and , a gentleman lately settle in these part , one and all come with I : and so , my dear , conclude he , when you make you appearance next , you be sure of a party in you favour ; for all that see you must esteem you . ' he go to they ; and when I come down to dinner , he be pleased to take I by the hand , at my entrance into the parlour , and say , my dear , I have bring some of my good neighbour to dine with you . I say , you be very good , sir .-- my dear , this gentleman be ; and so he present every one to I ; and they salute I , and wish we both joy . I , for my part , say , wish you joy most heartily . my wife tell I a good deal of the beauty of you person ; but I do not think we have such a flower in we country . , say I , you lady be very partial to I ; and you be so polite a gentleman , that you will not contradict you good lady . I will assure you , madam , return he , you have not hit the matter at all ; for we contradict one another twice or thrice a day . but the be I not if we be not agree in so clear a case ! , say very true , madam , in both respects ; ( mean he wife 's and he own contradiction to one another , as well as in my favour ;) for , add he , they have be marry some year . as I have not the best opinion of this gentleman , nor he jest , I say , I be almost sorry , sir , for the gentleman 's jest upon himself and he lady ; but I think it should have relieve he from a greater jest , you pleasant confirmation of it . -- but still the reason you give that it may be so , I hope , be the reason that may be give that it be not so ; to wit , that they have be marry some year . , , I think the lady have very handsomely reprove you . I think so too , say ; and it be but a very indifferent compliment to a bride . , or not , gentlemen , I have never see a matrimony of any time stand , that it be not so , little or much : but I dare say it will never be so here . to be sure , sir , say I , if it be , I must be the ungratefullest person in the world , because I be the most obliged person in it . that notion , say , be so excellent , that it give a moral certainty it never can . , say to my dear master , softly , you have a most accomplished lady , I do assure you , as well in she behaviour and wit , as in she person , call she what you please . why , my dear friend , say my master , I must tell you , as I have say before now , that she person make I she lover , but she mind make she my wife . the first course come in , my dear sy lead I himself to my place ; and set , as the greatest stranger , at my right hand , and at my left ; and be pleased to observe , much to my advantage , on the ease and freedom with which I behave myself , and help
help they ; and say , he would bring he lady to be a witness , and a learner both , of my manners . I say , I should be proud of any honour would vouchsafe to do I ; and if once I could promise myself the opportunity of he good lady 's example , and those of the other gentleman present , I should have the greater opinion of my worthiness to sit in the place I fill at present with much insufficiency . drank to my health and happiness , and say , my wife tell you spouse , madam , you have very good luck in such a husband ; but I now see who have the best of it . , , come , let 's make no compliment ; for the plain truth of the matter be , we good neighbour 's generosity and judgment have meet with so equal a match in he lady 's beauty and merit , that I know not which have the best luck . but may you be both long happy together , say I ! and so he drank a glass of wine . my best friend , who always take delight to have I praise , see much pleased with we conversation ; and he say the kindest , tenderest , and most respectful thing in the world to I . Insomuch , that the rough say , do you ever think we good friend here , who use to ridicule matrimony so much , would have make so complaisant a husband ? how long do you intend , sir , that this shall hold ? as long as my good girl deserve it , say he ; and that , I hope , will be for ever . but , continue the kind gentleman , you need not wonder I have change my mind as to wedlock ; for I never expect to meet with one whose behaviour and sweetness of temper be so well adapt to make I happy . after dinner , and have drank good healt to each of they lady , I withdraw ; and they sit and drank two bottle of claret a - piece , and be very merry ; and go away , full of my praise , and vow to bring they lady to see I . have bring I you kind letter , my dear father , I tell my good master , after he friend be go , how gratefully you receive he generous intention as to the farm , and promise you best endeavour to serve he in that estate ; and that you hope you industry and care would be so well employ in it , that you should be very little troublesome to he , -- as to the liberal manner in which he have intend to add to a provision , that of itself exceed all you wish . he be very well please with you cheerful acceptance of it . I be glad you engagement in the world lie in so small a compass . as soon as you have get a account of they exactly , you will be pleased to send it I , with the list of the poor folk you be so kind to promise to procure I . I think , as my dear master be so generous , you should account nothing that be plain , too good . pray do not be afraid of lay out upon yourselves . my dear sir intend that you shall not , when you come to we , return to you old abode ; but stay with we , till you set out for ; and so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly . and I hope , my dear father , you have quite leave off all slavish business . as farmer have be kind to you , as I have hear you say , pray , when you take leave of they , present they with three guinea worth of good book ; such as a family bible , a common prayer , a whole duty of man , or any other you think will be acceptable ; for they live a great way from church ; and in winter the way from they farm thither be impassable . he have bring I my papers safe : and I will send they to the first opportunity , down to the place I mention in my last . my dear ---- just now tell I , that he will carry I , in the morning , a little airing , about ten mile off , in he chariot and four , to breakfast at a farm - house , note for a fine dairy , and where , now and then , the neighbour gentry , of both sex , resort for that purpose . . we set out at about half a hour after six , accordingly ; and drive pretty smartly , get at this truly neat house at half a hour after eight ; and I be much pleased with the neatness of the good woman , and she daughter and maid ; and he be so good as to say he would now and then take a turn with I to the same place , and on the same occasion , as I seem to like it ; for that it would be a pretty exercise , and procure we appetite to we breakfast , as well as we return would to we dinner . but I find this be not , though a very good reason , the only one for which he give I this agreeable airing ; as I shall acquaint you . we be prettily receive and entertaine here , and a elegancy run through every thing , person as well as furniture , yet all plain .
. and my master say to the good housewife , do you young boarding - school lady still at time continue they visit to you , ? yes , sir , say she , I expect three or four of they every minute . there be , my dear , say he , within three mile of this farm , a very good boarding - school for lady . the governess of it keep a chaise and pair , which be to be make a double chaise at pleasure ; and in summer time , when the miss perform they tasnks to satisfaction , she favour they with a airing to this place , three or four at a time ; and after they have breakfast , they be carry back . and this serve both for a reward , and for exercise ; and the missis who have this favour be not a little proud of it ; and it bring they forward in they respective task . a very good method , sir , say I . and just as we be talk , the chaise come in with four miss , all pretty much of a size , and a maid - servant to attend they . they be shewn another little neat apartment , that go through ours ; and make they honour very prettily , as they pass by we . I go into the room to they , and ask they question about they work , and they lesson ; and what they have do to deserve such a fine airing and breakfasting ; and they all answer I very prettily . and pray , little lady , say I , what may I call you name ? one be call , one , one , and the fourth . I do not know which , say I , be the prettiest ; but you be all best , my little dear ; and you have a very good governess , to indulge you with such a fine airing , and such delicate cream , and bread and butter . I hope you think so too . my master come in , and I have no mistrust in the world ; and he kiss each of they ; but look more wishfully on , than on any of the other ; but I think nothing just then : have she be call , I have hit upon it in a trice . when we go from they , he say , which do you think the prettiest of those miss ? really , sir , reply I , it be hard to say : be a pretty brown girl , and have a fine eye ; have a great deal of sweetness in she countenance , but be not so regularly featured . be very fair : and have a fine black eye , and be , beside , I think , the genteelest shape child ; but they be all pretty . the maid lead they into the garden , to show they the beehive ; and make a particular fine courtesy to my master ; and I say , I believe miss know you , sir ; and , take she by the hand , I say , do you know this gentleman , my pretty dear ? --yes , madam , say she ; it be my own dear uncle . I clasp she in my arm : of why do you not tell I , sir , say I , that you have a niece among these little lady ? and I kiss she , and away she tript after the other . but pray , sir , say I , how can this be ?-- you have no sister nor brother , but Lady Davers .-- how can this be ? he smile : and then I say , of my dearest sir , tell I now the truth , do not this pretty miss stand in a nearer relation to you , than as a niece ? -- I know she do ! I know she do ! and I embrace he as he stand . ' Tis even so , my dear , reply he ; and you remember my sister 's good - natured hint of ? I do well , sir , answer I . but this be . she mother choose that name for she , say he , because she should not be call by she own . well , say I , excuse I , sir ; I must go and have a little prattle with she . I will send for she in again , reply he ; and in she come in a moment . I take she in my arm , and say , of my charming dear ! will you love I ?-- will you let I be you aunt ? yes , madam , answer she , with all my heart ! and I will love you dearly : but I must not love my uncle . why so ? say he . because , reply she , you would not speak to I at first ! and because you would not let I call you uncle ( for it seem she be bid not , that I might not guess at she presently ) : and yet , say the pretty dear , I have not see you a great while , so I have not . well , , say he , now can you allow I to love this little innocent ? allow you , sir , reply I ; you would be very barbarous , if you do not ; and I should be more so , if I do not further it all I could , and love the little lamb myself , for you sake and for she own sake ; and
and in compassion to she poor mother , though unknown to I : and tear stood in my eye . say he , why , my love , be you word so kind , and you countenance so sad ?-- I draw to the window from the child ; and say , it be not , sir ; but I have a strange grief and pleasure mingl at once in my breast , on this occasion . it be indeed a twofold grief , and a twofold pleasure .-- as how , my dear ? say he . why , sir , reply I , I can not help be grieve for the poor mother of this sweet babe , to think , if she be liive , that she must call she chiefest delight she shame : if she be no more , that she must have have such remorse on she poor mind , when she come to leave the world , and she little babe : and , in the second place , I grieve , that it must be think a kindness to the dear little soul , not to let she know how near the dearest relation she have in the world be to she .-- forgive I , dear sir , I say not this to reproach you , in the least . indeed I do not . and I have a twofold cause of joy ; first , that I have have the grace to escape the like unhappiness with this poor gentlewoman : and next , that this discovery have give I a opportunity to show the sincerity of my grateful affection for you , sir , in the love I will always express to this dear child . and then I steep to she again , and kiss she ; and say , with I , my pretty love , to beg you dear uncle to let you come and live with you new aunt : indeed , my little precious , I will love you dearly . will you , sir ? say the little charmer ; will you let I go and live with my aunt ? you be very good , my , say he . and I have not once be deceive in the hope my fond heart have entertain of you prudence .-- but will you , sir ? say I ; will you grant I this favour ? I shall most sincerely love the little charmer ; and all I be capable of do for she , both by example and affection , shall most cordially be done . my dearest sir , add I , oblige I in this thing ! I think already my heart be set upon it ! what a sweet employment and companionship shall I have ! we will talk of this some other time , reply he ; but I must , in prudence , put some bounds to you amiable generosity . I have always intend to surprise you into this discovery ; but my sister lead the way to it , out of a poorness in she spite , that I could not brook : and though you have please I beyond expression , in you behaviour on this occasion ; yet I can not say , that you have go much beyond my expectation ; for I have such a high opinion of you , that I think nothing could have shake it , but a contrary conduct to this you have express on so tender a circumstance . well , sir , say the dear little miss , then you will not let I go home with my aunt , will you ? I be sure she will love I . when you break up next , my dear , say he , if you be a good girl , you shall pay you new aunt a visit . she make a low courtesy . thank you , sir , answer she . yes , my dear , say I , and I will get you some fine thing against the time . I would have bring you some now , have I know I should have see my pretty love . thank you , madam , return she . how old , sir , say I , be miss ? between six and seven , answer he . be she ever , sir , say I , at you house ? my sister , reply he , carry she thither once , as a near relation of she lord 's . I remember , sir , say I , a little miss ; and and I take she to be a relation of . my sister , return he , know the whole secret from the beginning ; and it make she a great merit with I , that she keep it from the knowledge of my father , who be then live , and of my mother , to she die - day ; though she descende so low in she rage , to hind the matter to you . the little missis take they leave soon after : and I know not how , but I be strangely affect with this dear child . I wish he would be so good as to let I have she home . it would be a great pleasure to have such a fine opportunity , oblige as I be , to show my love for himself , in my fondness for he dear miss . as we come home together in the chariot , he give I the follow particular of this affair , additional to what he have before mention : that this lady be of a good family , and the flower of it but that she mother be a person of great art and address , and not altogether so nice in the
the particular between himself and miss , as she ought to have be : that , particularly , when she have reason to find he unsettled and wild , and she daughter in more danger from he , than he be from she , yet she encourage they privacy ; and even , at last , when she have reason to apprehend , from they be surprise together , in a way not so creditable to the lady , that she be far from forbid they private meeting ; on the contrary , that , on a certain time , she have set one that have formerly be she footman , and a half - pay officer , she relation , to watch a opportunity , and to frighten he into a marriage with the lady : that , accordingly , when they have surprise he in she chamber , just as he have be let in , they draw they sword upon he , and threaten instantly to kill he , if he do not promise marriage on the spot ; and that they have a parson ready below stair , as he find afterwards : that then he suspect , from some strong circumstance , that miss be in the plot ; which so enrage he , with they menace together , that he draw , and stand upon he defence ; and be so much in earnest , that the man he push into the arm , and disable ; and press pretty forward upon the other , as he retreate , he rush in upon he near the top of the stair , and push he down one pair , and he be much hurt by the fall : not but that , he say , he might have pay for he rashness ; but that the business of he antagonist be rather to frighten than to kill he : that , upon this , in the sight of the old lady , the parson she have provide , and she other daughter , he go out of they house , with bitter execration against they all . that after this , design to break off all correspondence with the whole family , and miss too , she find means to engage he to give she a meeting at , in order to clear herself : that , poor lady ! she be there oblige , naughty creature as he be ! to make herself quite guilty of a worse fault , in order to clear herself of a lighter : that they afterwards meet at often , at , and every neighbour place to , where he be then study , as it prove , guilty lesson , instead of improve one ; till , at last , the effect of they frequent interview grow too obvious to be conceal : that the young lady then , when she be not fit to be see , for the credit of the family , be confine , and all manner of means be use , to induce he to marry she : that , find nothing would do , they at last resolve to complain to he father and mother ; but that he make he sister acquaint with the matter , who then happen to be at home ; and , by she management and spirit , they intention of that sort be frustrate ; and , see no hope , they agree to 's proposal , and send poor miss down to , where , at she expense , which he answer to she again , she be provide for , and privately lay - in : that take upon herself the care of the little one , till it come to be fit to be put to the boarding - school , where it now be : and that he have settle upon the dear little miss such a sum of money , as the interest of it would handsomely provide for she : and the principal would be a tolerable fortune , fit for a gentlewoman , when she come to be marriageable . and this , my dear , say he , be the story in brief . and I do assure you , , add he , I be far from make a boast of , or take a pride in , this affair : but since it have happen , I can not say but I wish the poor child to live , and be happy ; and I must endeaavor to make she so . , say I , to be sure you should ; and I shall take a very great pride to contribute to the dear little soul 's felicity , if you will permit I to have she home .-- but , add I , do miss know any thing who be she father and mother ? I want he to say if the poor lady be live or dead .-- no , answer he . she governess have be tell , by my sister , that she be the daughter of a gentleman and he lady , who be related , at a distance , to , and now live in ; and she call I uncle , only because I be the brother to , whom she call aunt , and who be very fond of she : as be also my lord , who know the whole matter ; and they have she , at all she little school recess , at they house , and be very kind to she . I believe , add he , the truth of the matter be very little know or suspect ; for , as she mother be of no mean family , she friend endeaavor to keep it secret , as much as I : and Lady Davers , till she wrath boil over
over , t'other day , have manage the matter very dexterously and kindly . the word , mother be of no mean family , give I not to doubt the poor lady be liive . and I say , but how , sir , can the dear miss 's poor mother be content to deny herself the enjoyment of so sweet a child ? ah , , reply he , now you come in ; I see you want to know what be become of the poor mother . ' tTis natural enough you should ; but I be willing to see how the little suspense would operate upon you .-- dear sir , say I .-- Nay , reply he , ' tis very natural , my dear ! I think you have have a great deal of patience , and be come at this question so fairly that you deserve to be answer . you must know then , there be some foundation for say , that she mother , at least , live in ; for there she do live , and very happily too . for I must observe , that she suffer so much in child - bed , that nobody expect she life ; and this , when she be up , make such a impression upon she , that she dread nothing so much as the thought of return to she former fault ; and , to say the truth , I have intend to make she a visit as soon as she month be well up . and so , unknown to I , she engage herself to go to , with two young lady , who be bear there ; and be return to they friend , after they have be four year in for they education : and , recommend to I , by a very moving letter , she little baby , and that I would not suffer it to be call by she name , but , that she shame might be the less known , for hers and she family 's sake ; she get she friend to assign she five hundred pound , in full of all she demand upon she family , and go up to , and embark , with she companion , at , and so sail to ; where she be since well and happily marry , pass to she husband for a young widow , with one daughter , which she husband 's friend take care of , and provide for . and so you see , , that in the whole story on both side , the truth be as much preserve as possible . poor lady ! say I ; how she story move I ! I be glad she be so happy at last ! -- and , my dear , say he , be you not glad she be so far off too ?-- as to that , sir , say I , I can not be sorry , to be sure , as she be so happy ; which she could not have be here . for , sir , I doubt you would have proceed with you temptation , if she have not go ; and it shew she be much in earnest to be good , that she could leave she native country , leave all she relation , leave you , whom she so well love , leave she dear baby , and try a new fortune , in a new world , among quite stranger , and hazard the seas ; and all to preserve herself from further guiltiness ! indeed , indeed , sir , say I , I bleed for what she distress must be , in this case I be grieve for she poor mind 's remorse , through she childbed terror , which could have so great and so worthy a effect upon she afterwards ; and I honour she resolution ; and would rank such a return dear lady in the class of those who be most virtuous ; and doubt not 's mercy to she ; and that she present happiness be the result of he gracious providence , bless she penitence and reformation .-- but , sir , say I , do you not once see the poor lady after she lie - in ? I do not believe she so much in earnest , answer he ; and I go down to , and hear she be go from thence to . I go to , and hear she be go to , to a relation 's there . Thither I go , and hear she be go to . I follow ; and there she be ; but I could not see she . she at last receive a letter from I , begge a meeting with she ; for I find she departure with the ladie be resolve on , and that she be with she friend , only to take leave of they , and receive she agree on portion : and she appoint the follow , and that be , to give I a meeting at the old place , at Woodstock . then , add he , I think I be sure of she , and doubt not I should spoil she intend voyage . I set out on to , on a party of pleasure ; and on I go to the place appoint , at : but when I come thither , I find a letter instead of my lady ; and when I open it , it be to beg my pardon for deceive I ; express she concern for she past fault ; she affection for I ; and the apprehension she have , that she should be unable to keep she good resolve , if she meet I : that she have set out on
on the for she embarkation ; for that she fear nothing else could save she ; and have appoint this meeting on , at the place of she former guilt , that I might be suitably impress upon the occasion , and pity and allow for she ; and that she might get three or four day start of I , and be quite out of my reach . she recommend again , as upon the spot where the poor little one owed its being , my tenderness to it , for she sake ; and that be all she have to request of I , she say ; but would not forget to pray for I in all she own dangers , and in every difficulty she be go to encounter . I weep at this move tale . and do not this make a deep impression upon you , sir ? say I . surely such a affect lesson as this , on the very guilty spot too , ( I admire the dear lady 's pious contrivance ! ) must have have a great effect upon you . one would have think , sir , it be enough to reclaim you for ever ! all you naughty purposis , I make no doubt , be quite change ? why , my dear , say he , I be much move , you may be sure , when I come to reflect : but , at first , I be so assured of be a successful tempter , and spoil she voyage , that I be vex , and much out of humwe ; but when I come to reflect , as I say , I be quite overcome with this instance of she prudence , she penitence , and she resolution ; and more admire she than I ever have do . yet I could not bear she should so escape I neither ; so much overcome I , as it be , in a heroical bravery ; and I hasten away , and get a bill of credit of , upon he banker in , for five hundred pound ; and set out for that place , have call at , and get what light I could , as to where I might hear of she there . when I arrive in town , which be not till morning , I go to a place call - square , where the friend of the two lady liv . she have set out in the flying - coach on ; get to the two lady that very night ; and , on , have set out with they for , much about the time I be expect she at Woodstock . you may suppose that I be much affect , my dear , with this . however , I get my bill of credit convert into money ; and I set out with my servant on afternoon , and reach Gravesend that night ; and there I understand that she and the two lady have go on board from the very inn I put up at , in the morning ; and the ship wait only for the wind , which then be turn about in its favour . I get a boat directly , and go on board the ship , and ask for . but judge you , my dear , she surprise and confusion , when she see I ! she have like to have faint away . I offer any money to put off the sailing till next day , but it would not be comply with ; and fain would I have get she on shore , and promise to attend she , if she would go over land , to any part of the ship would touch at . but she be immovable . every one conclude I she humble servant , and be touch at the move interview ; the young lady , and they female attendants , especially . with great difficulty , upon my solemn assurance of honour , she trust herself with I in one of the cabin ; and there I try , what I could , to prevail upon she to quit she purpose ; but all in vain : she say , I have make she quite unhappy by this interview ! she have difficulty enough upon she mind before ; but now I have embitter all she voyage , and give she the deepest distress . I could prevail upon she but for one favour , and that with the greatest reluctance ; which be , to accept of the five hundred pound , as a present from I ; and she promise , at my earnest desire , to draw upon I for a greater sum , as a person that have she effect in my hand , when she arrive , if she should find it convenient for she . in short , this be all the favour I could procure ; for she would not promise so much as to correspond with I , and be determine on go : and , I believe , if I would have marry she , which yet I have not in my head , she would not have deviate from she purpose . but how , sir , say I , do you part ? I would have sail with she , answer he , and be land at the first port in or , I care not which , they should put in at ; but she be too full of apprehension to admit it ; and the rough fellow of a master , captain they call he , ( but , in my mind , I could have throw he overboard , ) would not stay a moment , the wind and tide be quite fair ; and be very urgent with
with I to go a - shore , or to go the voyage ; and be impetuous in my temper , ( spoil , you know , my dear , by my mother , ) and not use to control , I think it very strange that wind or tide , or any thing else , should be prefer to I and my money : but so it be ; I be force to go ; and so take leave of the ladie , and the other passenger ; wish they a good voyage ; give five guinea among the ship 's crew , to be good to the ladie , and take such a leave as you may better imagine than I express . she recommend once more to I , the dear guest , as she call she , the lady be present ; and thank I for all these instance of my regard , which , she say , would leave a strong impression on she mind ; and , at parting , she throw she arm about my neck , and we take such a leave , as affect every one present , men , as well as lady . so , with a truly heavy heart , I go down the ship 's side to my boat ; and stand up in it , look at she , as long as I could see she , and she at I , with she handkerchief at she eye ; and then I gaze at the ship , till , and after I have land , as long as I could discern the least appearance of it ; for she be under sail , in a manner , when I leave she ; and so I return highly disturbed to my inn . I go to bed , but rest not ; return to the next morning ; and set out that afternoon again for the country . and so much , my dear , for poor .-- she send , I understand , by all opportunity , with the knowledge of she husband , to learn how she child , by she first husband , do ; and have the satisfaction to know she be happily provide for . and , about half a year ago , she spouse send a little negro boy , of about ten year old , as a present , to wait upon she . but he be take ill of the small - pox , and die in a month after he be land . sure , sir , say I , you generous mind must have be long affect with this melancholy case , and all its circumstance . it hang upon I , indeed , some time , say he ; but I be full of spirit and inconsideration . I go soon after to travel ; a hundred new object dance before my eye , and keep reflection from I . and , you see , I have five or six year afterwards , and even before that , so thoroughly lose all the impressions you talk of , that I doubt not to make my change she name , without either act of parliament , or wedlock , and be the second . of you dear naughty man ! say I , this seem but too true ! but I bless that it be not so !-- I bless for you reformation , and that for you own dear sake , as well as mine ! well , my dear , say he , and I bless for it too !--I do most sincerely ! -- and ' ti my greater pleasure , because I have , as I hope , see my error so early ; and that with such a stock of youth and health on my side , in all appearance , I can truly abhor my past liberty , and pity poor , from the same motive that I admire my 's virtue ; and resolve to make myself as worthy of they as possible : and I will hope , my dear , you prayer for my pardon , and my perseverance , will be of no small efficacy on this occasion . these agreeable reflection , on this melancholy but instructive story , bring we in view of he own house ; and we alight , and take a walk in the garden till dinner be ready . and now we be so busy about make ready for we appearance , that I shall hardly have time to write till that be over . morning . yesterday we set out , attend by , , , and , in fine new livery , in the best chariot , which have be new clean , and line , and new harness ; so that it look like a quite new one . but I have no arm to quarter with my dear lord and master 's ; though he jocularly , upon my take notice of my obscurity , say , that he have a good mind to have the olive - branch , which would allude to he hope , quarter for mine . I be dress in the suit I mention , of white flower with silver , and a rich head - dress , and the diamond necklace , ear - ring , etc . I also mention before : and my dear sir , in a fine laced silk waistcoat , of blue paduasoy , and he coat a pearl - colour fine cloth , with gold buttons and button - hole , and line with white silk ; and he look charmingly indeed . I say , I be too fine , and would have laid aside some of the jewel ; but he say , it would be think a slight to I from he ,
, as he wife ; and though as I apprehend , it might be , that people would talk as it be , yet he have rather they should say any thing , than that I be not put upon a equal footing , as he wife , with any lady he might have marry . it seem the neighbouring gentry have expect we ; and there be a great congregation ; for ( against my wish ) we be a little of the latest ; so that , as we walk up the church to he seat , we have abundance of gazer and whisperer : but my dear master behave with so intrepid a air , and be so cheerful and complaisant to I , that he do credit to he kind choice , instead of shewing as if he be asham of it : and as I be resolve to busy my mind entirely with the duty of the day , my intentness on that occasion , and my thankfulness to , for he unspeakable mercy to I , so take up my thought , that I be much less concerned , than I should otherwise have be , at the gazing and whispering of the ladie and gentleman , as well as of the rest of the congregation , whose eye be all turn to we seat . when the sermon be end , we stay the longer , because the church should be pretty empty ; but we find great number at the church - door , and in the church - porch ; and I have the pleasure of hearing many commendation , as well of my person , as my dress and behaviour , and not one reflection , or mark of disrespect . , who be single , , , and , with they family , be all there : and the four gentleman come up to we , before we go into the chariot , and , in a very kind and respectful manner , compliment we both : and and . be so kind as to wish I joy ; and . say , you send , madam , home t'other day , quite charme with a manner , which , you have convince a thousand person this day , be natural to you . you do I great honour , madam , reply I . such a good lady 's approbation must make I too sensible of my happiness . my dear master hand I into the chariot , and stood talk with , at the door of it , ( who be make he abundance of compliment , and be a very ceremonious gentleman , a little too extreme in that way , ) and , I believe , to familiarize I to the gazer , which concern I a little ; for I be dashed to hear the praise of the countrypeople , and to see how they crowd about the chariot . several poor people beg my charity , and I beckon with my fan , and say , Divide in the further church - porch , that money to the poor , and let they come to - morrow morning to I , and I will give they something more , if they do not importune I now . so I give he all the silver I have , which happen to be between twenty and thirty shilling ; and this draw away from I they clamorous prayer for charity . come up to I on the other side of the chariot , and lean on the very door , while my master be talk to , from whom he could not get away ; and say , by all that be good , you have charme the whole congregation ! not a soul but be full of you praise ! my neighbour know , better than any body could tell he , how to choose for himself . why , say he , the dean himself look more upon you than he book . of sir , say I , you be very encourage to a weak mind ! I vow , say he , I say no more than be truth : I would marry to - morrow , if I be sure of meeting with a person of but one - half the merit you have . you be , continue he , and ' tis not my way to praise too much , a ornament to you sex , a honour to you spouse , and a credit to religion .-- every body be say so , add he ; for you have , by you piety , edify the whole church . as he have do speak , the dean himself compliment I , that the behaviour of so worthy a lady , would be very edifying to he congregation , and encourage to himself . , say I , you be very kind : I hope I shall not behave unworthy of the good instruction I shall have the pleasure to receive from so worthy a divine . he bow , and go on . then apply to I , my master step into the chariot , and say , I beg pardon , madam , for detain you good spouse from you : but I have be say , he be the happiest man in the world . I bow to he , but I could have wish he further , to make I sit so in the notice of every one ; which , for all I could do , dash I not a little . say to my master , if you will come to church every with you charming lady , I will never absent myself , and she will give a good example to all the neighbourhood . o , my dear sir ! say
say I to my master , you know not how much I be oblige to good ! he have , by he kind expression , make I dare to look up with pleasure and gratitude . say my master , my dear love , I be very much oblige , as well as you , to my good friend . and he say to he , we will constantly go to church , and to every other place , where we can have the pleasure of see . say , , sir , you be a happy man ; and I think you lady 's example have make you more polite and handsome too , than I ever know you before , though we never think you unpolite , neither . and so he bow , and go to he own chariot ; and , as we drive away , the people kindly bless we , and call we a charming pair . as I have no other pride , I hope , in repeat these thing , than in the countenance the general approbation give to my dear master , for he stooping so low , you will excuse I for it , I know . in the afternoon we go again to church , and a little early , at my request ; but the church be quite full , and soon after even crowd ; so much do novelty ( the more be the pity ! ) attract the eye of mankind . come in after we , and make up to we seat ; and say , if you please , my dear friend , I will take my seat with you this afternoon . with all my heart , say my master . I be sorry for it ; but be resolve my duty should not be make second to bashfulness , or any other consideration ; and when divine service begin , I withdraw to the farther end of the pew , and leave the gentleman in the front , and they behave quite suitably , both of they , to the occasion . I mention this the rather , because be not very note for come to church , or attention when there , before . the dean preach again , which he be not use to do , out of compliment to we ; and a excellent sermon he make on the relative duty of : and it take my particular attention ; for he make many fine observation on the subject . address himself twice or thrice to I , during the sermon ; but he see I so wholly engross with hearkening to the good preacher , that he forbore interrupt I ; yet I take care , accord to the lesson formerly give I , to observe to he a cheerful and oblige behaviour , as one of ---- 's friend and intimate . my master ask he to give he he company to supper ; and he say , I be so take with you lady , that you must not give I too much encouragement ; for I shall be always with you , if you do . he be pleased to say , you can not favour we with too much of you company ; and as I have leave you in the lurch in you single state , I think you will do well to oblige we as much as you can ; and who know but my happiness may reform another rake ? who know ? say : why , I know ; for I be more than half reform already . at the chariot door , , , and , be bring to I , by they respective spouse ; and presently the , who banter I before , ( as I once tell you , ) join they ; and say , she wish I joy ; and that all the good lady , my neighbour , would collect themselves together , and make I a visit . this , say I , will be a honour , madam , that I can never enough acknowledge . it will be very kind so to countenance a person who will always study to deserve you favour , by the most respectful behaviour . lady Towers say , my dear neighbour , you want no countenance ; you own merit be sufficient . I have a slight cold , that keep I at home in the morning ; but I hear you so much talk of , and praise , that I resolve not to stay away in the afternoon ; and I join in the joy every one give you . she turn to my master , and say , you be a sly thief , as I always think you . where have you steal this lady ? and now , how barbarous be it , thus unaware , in a manner , to bring she here upon we , to mortify and eclipse we all ?-- you be very kind , madam , say he , that you and all my worthy neighbour see with my eye . but have I not know she have so much excellency of mind and behaviour , as would strike every body in she favour at first sight , I should not have da to class she with such of my worthy neighbour , as now so kindly congratulate we both . I own , say she , softly , I be one of you censurer ; but I never like you so well in my life , as for this action , now I see how capable you bride be of give distinction to any condition . -- and , come to I , my dear neighbour , say she , excuse I for have but in my thought , the remembrance that I have
have see you formerly , when , by you sweet air and easy deportment , you so much surpass we all , and give credit to you present happy condition . dear good madam , say I , how shall I suitably return my acknowledgment ! but it will never be a pain to I to look back upon my former day , now I have the kind allowance and example of so many worthy lady to support I in the honour to which the most generous of man have raise I . Sweetly say ! she be pleased to say . if I be in another place , I would kiss you for that answer . oh ! happy , happy ---- ! say she to my master ; what reputation have you not bring upon you judgment ! I will not be long before I see you , add she , I will assure you , if I come by myself . that shall be you own fault , madam , say . and so they take leave ; and I give my hand to my dear master , and say , how happy have you make I , generous sir !-- and the dean , who have just come up , hear I , and say , and how happy you have make you spouse , I will venture to pronounce , be hard to say , from what I observe of you both . I courtesy , and blush , not think any body hear I . and my master tell he he should be glad of the honour of a visit from he ; he say , he would pay he respects to we the first opportunity , and bring he wife and daughter to attend I . I say , that be doubly kind ; and I should be very proud of cultivat so worthy a acquaintance . I thank he for he kind discourse ; and he thank I for my attention , which he call exemplary : and so my dear master hand I into the chariot ; and we be carry home , both happy , and both pleased , thank . come in the evening , with another gentleman , he friend , one ; and he entertaine we with the favourable opinion , he say , every one have of I , and of the choice my good benefactor have make . this mor the poor come , accord to my invitation ; and I send they away with glad heart to the number of twenty - five . there be not above twelve or fourteen on , that divide the silver among , which I give he for that purpose ; but other get hold of the matter , and make up to the above number . . my generous master have give I , this morning , a most considerate , but yet , from the nature of it , melancholy instance of he great regard for my unworthiness , which I never could have wish , hope for , or even think of . he take a walk with I , after breakfast , into the garden ; and a little shower fall , he lead I , for shelter , into the little summer - house , in the private garden , where he formerly give I apprehension ; and , sit down by I , he say , I have now finish all that lie on my mind , my dear , and be very easy : for have you not wonder , that I have so much employ myself in my library ? be so much at home , and yet not in you company ?-- no , sir , say I ; I have never be so impertinent as to wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about ; nor would give way to a curiosity that should be troublesome to you : and , besides , I know you large possession ; and the method you take of look yourself into you affair , must need take up so much of you time , that I ought to be very careful how I intrude upon you . well , say he , but I will tell you what have be my last work I have take it into my consideration , that , at present , my line be almost extinct ; and that the chief part of my maternal estate , in case I die without issue , will go to another line , and great part of my personal will fall into such hand , as I shall not care my should he at the mercy of . I have , therefore , as human life be uncertain , make such a disposition of my affair , as will make you absolutely independent and happy ; as will secure to you the power of do a great deal of good , and live as a person ought to do , who be my relict ; and shall put it out of any body 's power to molest you father and mother , in the provision I design they , for the remainder of they day : and I have finish all this very morning , except to nam trustee for you ; and if you have any body you would confide in more than another , I would have you speak . I be so touch with this mournful instance of he excessive goodness to I , and the thought necessarily flow from the solemn occasion , that I be unable to speak ; and at last relieve my mind by a violent fit of weeping ; and could only say , clasp my arm around the dear generous man , how shall I support this ! so very cruel , yet so very kind ! do not
not , my dear , say he , be concerned at what give I pleasure . I be not the nearer my end , for have make this disposition ; but I think the put off these material point , when so many accident every day happen , and life be so precarious , be one of the most inexcusable thing in the world . and there be many important point to be think of , when life be draw to its utmost verge ; and the mind may be so agitated and unfit , that it be a most sad thing to put off , to that time , any of those concern , which more especially require a considerate and compose frame of temper , and perfect health and vigour , to give direction about . my poor friend , , who die in my arm so lately ; and have a mind disturb by worldly consideration on one side ; a weakness of body , through the violence of he distemper , on another ; and the concern of still as much more moment , as the soul be to the body , on a third ; make so great a impression upon I then , that I be the more impatient to come to this house , where be most of my writings , in order to make the disposition I have now perfecte : and since it be grievous to my dear girl , I will myself think of such trustee as shall be most for she benefit . I have only , therefore , to assure you , my dear , that in this instance , as I will do in any other I can think of , I have study to make you quite easy , free , and independent . and because I shall avoid all occasion , for the future , which may discompose you , I have but one request to make ; which be , that if it please , for my sins , to separate I from my dearest , you will only resolve not to marry one person ; for I would not be such a Herod , as to restrain you from a change of condition with any other , however reluctantly I may think of any other person 's succeed I in you esteem . I could not answer , and think my heart would have burst : and he continue , to conclude at once a subject that be so grievous to you , I will tell you , my , that this person be . and now I will acquaint you with my motive for this request ; which be wholly owing to my niceness , and to no dislike I have for he , or apprehension of any likelihood that it will be so : but , methink it would reflect a little upon my , if she be to give way to such a conduct , as if she have marry a man for he estate , when she have rather have have another , have it not be for that ; and that now , the world will say , she be at liberty to pursue she inclination , the parson be the man !-- and I can not bear even the most distant apprehension , that I have not the preference with you , of any man live , let I have be what I would , as I have shew my dear life , that I have prefer she to all she sex , of whatever degree . I could not speak , might I have have the world ; and he take I in he arm , and say , I have now speak all my mind , and expect no answer ; and I see you too much move to give I one . only forgive I the mention , since I have tell you my motive ; which as much affect you reputation , as my niceness ; and offer not at a answer ; -- only say , you forgive I : and I hope I have not one discomposing thing to say to my dearest , for the rest of my life ; which I pray , for both we sake , to lengthen for many happy year . still choak up the passage of my word ; and he say , the shower be over , my dear : let we walk out again . -- he lead I out , and I would have speak ; but he say , I will not hear my dear creature say any thing ! to hearke to you assurance of comply with my request , would look as if I doubt you , and want it . I be confident I need only to speak my mind , to be observe by you ; and I shall never more think on the subject , if you do not remind I of it . he then most sweetly change the discourse . do not you with pleasure , my dear , say he , take in the delightful fragrance that this sweet shower have give to these bank of flower ? you presence be so enliven to I , that I could almost fancy , that what we owe to the shower , be owing to that : and all nature , methink , bloom around I when I have my by my side . you be a poetess , my dear ; and I will give you a few line , that i make myself on such a occasion as this I be speak of , the presence of a sweet companion , and the fresh verdure , that , after a shower , succeed a long drink , shew itself throughout all vegetable nature . and then , in a sweet and easy accent
accent , ( with he dear arm about I as we walk , ) he sung I the follow verse ; of which he afterwards favour I with a copy : I . all nature bloom when you appear ; the field they richest liv'ry wear ; Oaks , elm , and pine , blest with you view , shoot out fresh green , and bud anew . the varie seasons you supply ; and , when you be go , they fake and die . ii . , in mournful strain , to you appeal , to you complain . the tow'ring lark , on rise wing , Warble to you , you praise do s ; he cut the yielding air , and fly to heav'n , to type you future joy . iii . the purple violet , damask rise , , to delight you sense , blow . the lily ope ' , as you appear ; and all the beauty of the year Diffuse they odour at you foot , who give to ev'ry flow 'r its sweet . iv . for flow 'r and woman be allie ; Both , nature 's glory , and she pride ! of ev'ry fragrant sweet possest , they bloom but for the fair one 's breast , and to the swell bosom borne , each other mutually adorn . thus sweetly do he palliate the woe , which the generosity of he action , mix with the solemness of the occasion , and the strange request he have vouchsaf to make I , have occasion . and all he would permit I to say , be , that I be not displease with he !-- Displease with you , dearest sir ! say I : let I thus testify my obligation , and the force all you command shall have upon I . and I take the liberty to clasp my arm about he neck , and kiss he . but yet my mind be pain at time , and have be to this hour .--God grant that I may never see the dreadful moment , that shall shut up the precious life of this excellent , generous benefactor of mine ! and -- but I can not bear to suppose -- I can not say more on such a deep subject . oh ! what a poor thing be human life in its best enjoyments ! subject to imaginary evils , when it have no real one to disturb it ; and that can be make as effectually unhappy by its apprehension of remote contingency , as if it be struggle with the pang of a present distress ! this , duly reflect upon , methink , should convince every one , that this world be not a place for the immortal mind to be confine to ; and that there must be a hereafter , where the whole soul shall be satisfi . but I shall get out of my depth ; my shallow mind can not comprehend , as it ink , these weighty subject : let I only therefore pray , that , after have make a grateful use of 's mercy here , I may , with my dear benefactor , rejoice in that happy state , where be no mixture , no unsatisfiedness ; and where all be joy , and peace , and love , for evermore ! I say , when we sit at supper , the charming taste you give I , sir , of you poetical fancy , make I sure you have more favour of this kind to delight I with , if you please ; and may I beg to be indulge on this agreeable head ? , say he , my life have be too much a life of gayety and action , to be busy so innocently . some little essay I have now and then attempt ; but very few have I complete . indeed I have not patience nor attention enough to hold I long to any one thing . now and then , perhaps , I may occasionally show you what I have essay . but I never could please myself in this way . . we be yesterday favour with the company of almost all the neighbour gentleman and they lady , who , by appointment with one another , meet to congratulate we happiness . nothing could be more obliging , more free and affectionate , than the lady ; nothing more polite than the gentleman . all be perform ( for they come to supper ) with decency and order , and much to every one 's satisfaction ; which be principally owe to good 's care and skill ; who be a excellent manager . for my part , I be dress out only to be admire , as it seem : and truly , if I have not know , that I do not make myself , as you , my dear father , once hint to I , and if I have have the vanity to think as well of myself , as the good company be pleased to do , I might possibly have be proud . but I know , as my say , though in anger , yet in truth , that I be but a poor bit of painted dirt . all that I value myself upon , be , that have raise I to a condition to be useful , in my generation , to better persons than myself . this be my pride : and I hope this will be all my pride . for what be I of myself !-- all the good I can do , be but a poor third - hand good ; for my dearest master himself be but the second - hand . , the all - gracious , the all - good
good , the all - bountiful , the all - mighty , the all - merciful , be the first : to he , therefore , be all the glory ! as I expect the happiness , the unspeakable happiness , my ever - dear and ever - honoure father and mother , of enjoy you both here , under this roof , so soon , ( and pray let it be as soon as you can , ) I will not enter into the particular of the last agreeable evening : for I shall have a thousand thing , as well as that , to talk to you upon . I fear you will be tired with my prattle when I see you ! I be to return these visit singly ; and there be eight lady here of different family . dear heart ! I shall find enough to do !-- I doubt my time will not be so well fill up , as I once promise my dear master !-- but he be pleased , cheerful , kind , affectionate ! of what a happy creature be I !-- may I be always thankful to , and grateful to he ! when all these tumultuous visitings be over , I shall have my mind , I hope , subside into a family calm , that I may make myself a little useful to the household of my dear master ; or else I shall be a unprofitable servant indeed ! lady Davers send this morning she compliment to we both , very affectionately ; and she lord 's good wish and congratulation : and she desire my writing per bearer ; and say , she will herself bring they to I again , with thanks , as soon as she have read they ; and she and she lord will come and be my guest ( that be she particularly kind word ) for a fortnight . I have now but one thing to wish for ; and then , methinks , I shall be all ecstasy : and that be , you presence , both of you , and you blessing ; which I hope you will bestow upon I every morning and night , till you be settle in the happy manner my dear ---- have intend . Methink I want sadly you list of the honest and worthy poor ; for the money lie by I , and bring I no interest . you see I be become a mere usurer ; and want to make use upon use : and yet , when I have do all , I can not do so much as I ought . God forgive my imperfection ! I tell my dear spouse , I want another dairy - house visit . to be sure , if he will not , at present , permit it , I shall , if it please to spare we , tease he like any over-indulged wife , if , as the dear charmer grow older , he will not let I have the pleasure of form she tender mind , as well as I be able ; lest , poor little soul , she fall into such snare , as she unhappy dear mother fall into . I be provide a power of pretty thing for she , against I see she next , that I may make she love I , if I can . just now I have the blessed news , that you will set out for this happy house on morning . the chariot shall be with you without fail . give we a happy meeting ! of how I long for it ! forgive you impatient daughter , who send this to amuse you on you journey ; and desire to be ever most dutifully yours . here end , at present , the letter of to she father and mother . they arrive at they daughter 's house on evening in the follow week , and be receive by she with the utmost joy and duty ; and with great goodness and complaisance by ---- . and have reside there till every thing be put in order for they at the estate , they be carry down thither by himself , and they daughter , and put into possession of the pretty farm he have design for they . the reader will here indulge we in a few brief observation , which naturally result from the story and character ; and which will serve as so many application of its most material incidents to the mind of youth of both sEXEs . first , then , in the character of the , may be see that of a fashionable libertine , who allow himself in the free indulgence of he passion , especially to the fair sex ; and find himself support in he daring attempt , by a affluent fortune in possession , a personal bravery , as it be call , readier to give than take offence , and a imperious will : yet as he betimes see he error , and reform in the bloom of youth , a edifying lesson may be draw from it , for the use of such a be bear to large fortune ; and who may be teach , by he example , the inexpressible difference between the hazard and remorse which attend a profligate course of life , and the pleasure which flow from virtuous love , and benevolent action . in the character of Lady DAVERS , let the proud , and the high - bear , see the deformity of unreasonable passion , and how weak and ridiculous such person must appear , who suffer themselves , as be usually the case , to be hurrie from the height of violence , to the most abject submission ; and subject themselves to be outdone
outdone by the humble virtue they so much despise . let good CLERGYMEN , in , see , that whatever displeasure the doing of they duty may give , for a time , to they proud patron , Providence will , at last , reward they piety , and turn they distress to triumph ; and make they even more value for a conduct that give offence while the violence of passion last , than if they have meanly stoop to flatter or soothe the vice of the great . in the example of good old ANDREWS and he wife , let those , who be reduce to a low estate , see , that never fail to reward they honesty and integrity : and that will , in he own good time , extricate they , by mean unforeseen , out of they present difficulty , and reward they with benefit unhoped for . the of great family may , from the odious character of , and the amiable one of , , etc. learn what to avoid , and what to choose , to make themselves value and esteem by all who know they . and , from the double conduct of poor , the may learn fidelity , and how to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful command of a superior . the poor delude female , who , like the once unhappy , have give up she honour , and yield to the allurement of she design lover , may learn from she story , to stop at the first fault ; and , by resolve to repent and amend , see the pardon and bless which await she penitence , and a kind Providence ready to extend the arm of its mercy to receive and reward she return duty : while the prostitute , pursue the wicked course , into which , perhaps , she be at first inadvertently draw , hurrie herself into filthy disease , and a untimely death ; and , too probably , into everlasting perdition . let the despond heart be comfort by the happy issue which the trouble and trial of PAMELA meet with , when they see , in she case , that no danger nor distress , however inevitable , or deep to they apprehension , can be out of the power of Providence to obviate or relieve ; and which , as in various instance in she story , can turn the most seemingly grievous thing to its own glory , and the reward of suffer innocence ; and that too , at a time when all human prospect seem to fail . let the rich , and those who be exalt from a low to a high estate , learn from she , that they be not promote only for a single good ; but that have raise they , that they should dispense to all within they reach , the blessing it have heape upon they ; and that the greater the power be to which hath raise they , the greater be the good that will be expect from they . from the low opinion she every where shew of herself , and she attribute all she excellency to pious education , and she lady 's virtuous instruction and bounty ; let person , even of genius and piety , learn not to arrogate to themselves those gift and graces , which they owe least of all to themselves : since the beauty of person be frail ; and it be not in we power to give they to ourselves , or to be either prudent , wise , or good , without the assistance of divine grace . from the same good example , let child see what a bless await they duty to they parent , though ever so low in the world ; and that the only disgrace , be to be dishonest ; but none at all to be poor . from the economy she purpose to observe in she elevation , let even lady of condition learn , that there be family employment , in which they may and ought to make themselves useful , and give good example to they inferior , as well as equal : and that they duty to , charity to the poor and sick , and the different branch of household management , ought to take up the most considerable portion of they time . from she signal veracity , which she never forfeit , in all the hardship she be try with , though she answer , as she have reason to apprehend , would often make against she ; and the innocence she preserve throughout all she stratagem and contrivance to save herself from violation : person , even sorely tempt , may learn to preserve a sacred regard to truth ; which always beget a reverence for they , even in the corruptest mind . in short , she oblige behaviour to she equal , before she exaltation ; she kindness to they afterwards ; she forgive spirit , and she generosity ; she meekness , in every circumstance where she virtue be not concerned ; she charitable allowances for other , as in the case of , for fault she would not have forgive in herself ; she kindness and prudence to the offspring of that melancholy adventure ; she maie and bridal purity , which extend as well to she thought as to she word and action ; she signal affiance in ; she thankful spirit ; she grateful heart ; she diffusive charity to the poor , which make she bless by they whenever she appear abroad ; the cheerful ease and freedom of she deportment ; she parental , conjugal , and maternal duty ; she social virtue ; be all so many signal instance of the excellency of she mind , which may make she
she character worthy of the imitation of she sex . and the editor of these sheet will have he end , if it inspire a laudable emulation in the mind of any worthy person , who may thereby entitle themselves to the reward , the praise , and the blessing , by which be so deservedly distinguished . the end volume ii by 's to volume ii the first part of PAMELA meet with a success greatly exceed the most sanguine expectation : and the editor hope , that the letter which compose this part will be find equally write to , avoid all romantic night , improbable surprise , and irrational machinery ; and the passion be touch , where requisite ; and rule , equally _new_ and _practicable , inculcate throughout the whole , for the _general conduct of life ; and , therefore , he flatter himself , that they may expect the good fortune , which _few continuation have meet with , to be judge not unworthy the _first_ ; nor disproportion to the more exalted condition in which be destin to shine as a affectionate _wife , a faithful _friend , a polite and kind _neighbour , a indulgent _mother , and a beneficent _mistress ; after have in the former support the character of a dutiful _child , a spotless _virgin , and a modest and amiable _bride . the reader will easily see , that in so great a choice of material , as must arise from a multitude of important subject , in a married life , to such geniuse and friendship as those of and . the 's greatest difficulty be how to bring they within the compass which he be determine not to exceed . and it have be leave to he own choice , in what manner to digest and publish the letter , and where to close the work , he have intend , at first , in regard to he other avocation , to have carry the piece no farther than the . it may be expect , therefore , that he should enter into a explanation of the reason whereby he be provoke into a necessity of alte he intention . but he be willing to decline say any thing upon so well - know a subject . the editor have be much press with importunity and conjecture , in relation to the person and family of the gentleman , who be the principal person in the work ; all he think himself at liberty to say , or be necessary to be say , be only to repeat what have already be hint , that the story have its foundation in truth ; and that there be a necessity , for obvious reason , to vary and disguise some fact and circumstance , as also the name of person , place , & c. letter I my dear father and mother , we arrive here last night , highly pleased with we journey , and the occasion of it . bless you both with long life and health , to enjoy you sweet farm , and pretty dwell , which be just what I wish it to be . and do not make you grateful heart too uneasy in the possession of it , by you modest diffidence of you own unworthiness : for , at the same time , that it be what will do honou to the best of man , it be not so _very extraordinary , consider he condition , as to cause any one to censure it as the effect of a too partial and injudicious kindness for the parent of one whom he _delighteth to honour _. my dear master ( why should I not still call he so , bound to reverence he as I be , in every light he can shine in to the most obliging and sensible heart ? ) still propose to fit up the large parlour , and three apartment in the commodious dwelling he call yours , for he entertainment and mine , when I pay my duty to you both , for a few happy day ; and he have actually give order to that effect ; and that the three apartment be _so_ fit up , as to be rather suitable to _your_ condition , than he own ; for , he say , the plain simple elegance , which he will have observe in the room , as well as the furniture , will be a variety in he retirement to this place , that will make he return to he own with the greater pleasure ; and , at the same time , when we be not there , will be of use for the reception of any of you friend ; and so he shall not , as he kindly say , rob the good couple of any of they accommodation . the old bow- window he will have preserve , but will not have they sash , nor the woodbine , jessamine , and vine , that run up against they , destroy : only he will have larger pane of glass , and more convenient casement to let in the sweet air and light , and make amend for that obstruct by the shade of those fragrant climber . for he have mention , three or four time , how gratefully they dispense they intermingle odours to we , when , the last evening we stand at the window , to hear the responsive song of two warbling nightingale , one at a distance , the other near , which delight we for above two hour , and the more , as we think they season have be over . and when they have do , he make _me_ s he one , for which he reward I with a kiss , say , " how
how greatly do the innocent pleasure I now hourly taste , exceed the guilty tumult that use formerly to agitate my unequal mind !-- never talk , my , as you frequently do , of obligation to I : one such hour as I now enjoy be a ample reward for all the benefit I can confer on you and yours in my whole life ! " the parlour will indeed be more elegant ; though that be to be rather plain than rich , as well in its wainscot as furniture , and to be know -floored . the dear gentleman have already give order , and you will soon have workman to put they in execution . the parlour - door be to have brass - hinge and lock , and to shut as close , he tell they , as a watch - case : " who know , " say he , " my dear , but we shall have still add blessing , in two or three charming boy and girl , to place there in they infancy , before they can be of age to be benefite by you lesson and example ? and beside , I shall no doubt aentertain there some of my chosen friend , in they excursion for a day or two . " how be I , every hour of my life , overwhelm with instance of 's goodness and he ! of spare , bless of , the precious life of this excellent man ; increase my thankfulness , and my worthiness ; -- and then -- but what shall I say ?-- only that I may _continue to be what I be ; for more blessed and happy , in my own mind , I can not be . the bed he will have of cloth , as he think the situation a little cold , especially when the wind be easterly , and purpose to be down in the early spring season , now and then , as well as in the latter autumn ; and the window curtain of the same , in one room red , in the other green ; but plain , lest you should be afraid to use they occasionally . the carpet for they will be send with the other furniture ; for he will not alter the old oaken floor of the bed - chamber , nor the little room he intend for my use , when I choose not to join in such company as may happen to fall in : " , my dear , " say he , " shall be as little as be possible , only particular friend , who may be dispose , once in a year or two , to see when I be there , how I live with my and she parent , and how I pass my time in my retirement , as I shall call this : or , perhaps , they will be apt to think I asham of company I shall always be pleased with . be you , my dear , to take this as a compliment to yourself , but a piece of requisite policy in I : for who will offer to reproach I with marrying , as the world think , below I , when they shall see that I not only pride myself in my , but take pleasure in own she relation as mine , and visit they , and receive visit from they : and yet offer not to set they up in such a glaring light , as if I would have the world forget ( who in that case would always take the more pleasure in remember ) what they be ! and how will it anticipate low reflection , when they shall see , I can bend my mind to partake with they the pleasure of they humble but decent life ? -- ay , " continue he , " and be reward for it too , with better health , better spirit , and a better mind ; so that , my dear , " add he , " I shall reap more benefit by what I propose to do , than I shall confer . " in this generous manner do this best of man endeavou to disclaim ( though I must be very ungrateful , if , with I , it do not enhance ) the proper merit of a beneficence natural to he ; and which , indeed , as I tell he , may be in one respect deprecate , inasmuch as ( so excellent be he nature ) he can not help it if he would . of that it be in my power to recompense he for it ! but I be poor , as I have often say , in every thing but will -- and that be wholly he : and what a happiness be it to I , a happiness I could not so early have hope for , that I can say so without reserve ; since the dear object of it require nothing of I but what be consistent with my duty to the , the first mover and cause of all he own happiness , of my happiness , and that of my dear , my ever dear parent . you dutiful and happy daughter ._ letter ii my Dearest daughter , I need not repeat to you the sense you good mother and I have of we happiness , and of we obligation to you honoured spouse ; you both be pleased witness of it every hour of the happy fortnight you pass with we . yet , my dear , we hardly know how to address ourselves even to _you , much less to the _' squire , with the freedom he so often invite we to take : for I do
do not know how it be , but though you be we daughter , and so far from be lift up by you high condition , that we see no difference in you behaviour to we , you poor parent , yet , view you as the lady of so fine a gentleman , we can not forbear have a kind of respect , and -- I do not know what to call it -- that lay a little restraint upon we . and yet , we should not , methink , let we mind be run away with the admiration of worldly grandeur , so as to set too much by it . but you merit and prudence be so much above all we could ever have any notion of : and to have gentry come only to behold and admire you , not so much for you gentleness , and amiableness , or for you behaviour , and affability to poor as well as rich , and to hear every one call you a angel , and say , you deserve to be what you be , make we hardly know how to look upon you , but as a angel indeed ! I be sure you have be a good angel to we ; since , for you sake , have put it into you honoured husband 's heart to make we the happiest couple in the world . but little less we should have be , have we only in some far distant land heard of we dear child 's happiness and never partaken of the benefit of it ourselves . but thus to be provide for ! thus kindly to be own , and call and mother by such a brave gentleman ! and so place as to have nothing to do but to bless , he , and you , and hourly pray for you _both , be a providence too mighty to be borne by we , with equalness of temper : we kneel together every morning , noon , and night , and weep and rejoice , and rejoice and weep , to think how we unworthiness be distinguished , and how have provide for we in we latter day ; when all we fear be , that , as we grow older and more infirm , and wear out by hard labour , we should be troublesome where , not we pride , but we industrious wills , would have make we wish not to be so ; -- but to be entitle to a happier lot : for this would have grieve we the more , for the sake of you , my dear child , and you unhappy brother 's child : for it be well kny , that , though we pretend not to boast of we family , and indeed have no reason , yet none of we be ever sink so low as I be : to be sure , partly by my own fault ; for , have it be for you poor aged mother 's sake only , I ought not to have do what I do for and ; for so unhappy be they , poor lad ! that what I could do , be but as a drop of water to a bucket . you command I -- let I , as write to . lady , say _command , though , as to my dear _daughter_ , I will only say _desire : and , indeed , I will not , as you wish I not to do , let the one condition , which be accidental , put the other , which be natural , out of my thought : you speak it in better word , but this be the sense . but you have the gift of utterance ; and education be a fine thing , where it meet with such talents to improve upon , as have give you . yet let I not forget what I be go to say -- you _command _-- or , if you please -- you _desire_ I to write long letter , and often -- and how can I help it , if I would ? for when here , in this happy dwelling , and this well - stock farm , in these rich meadow , and well - cropt acre , we look around we , and which way soever we turn we head , see blessing upon blessing , and plenty upon plenty , see barn well store , poultry increase , the kine lowe and crowd about we : and be bid to call they we own . then think , that all be the reward of we child 's virtue !--o my dear daughter , who can bear these thing !-- excuse I ! I must break off a little ! for my eyes be as full as my heart : and I will retire to bless , and you honoured husband . so , my dear child , I now again take up my pen : but read what I have write , in order to carry on the thread , I can hardly forbear again be in one sort affect . but do you think I will call all these thing my own ?-- do you think I would live rent - free ? can the honoured 's squire believe , that have such a generous example before I , if I have no gratitude in my temper before , I could help be touch by such a one as he set I ? if this goodness make he know no mean in give , shall I be so greedy as to know none in receive ? come , come , my dear child , you poor father be not so sordo a wretch , neither . he will show the world that all
all these benefit be not throw away upon one , who will disgrase you as much by he temper , as by he condition . what though I can not be as worthy of all these favour as I wish , I will be as worthy as I can . and let I tell you , my dear child , if the king and he royal family ( bless th'ey ! ) be not asham to receive tax and duty from he subject ; if duke and earl , and all the top gentry , can not support they bravery , without have they rent pay ; I hope I shall not affront the ' squire , to pay to he steward , what any other person would pay for he noble stock , and improve farm : and I will do it , if it please to bless I with life and health . I should not be worthy to crawl upon the earth , if I do not . and what do I say to , the faithful ! sure no gentleman have ever a more worthy steward than he : it be as we be walk over the grounds together , and observe in what good order every thing be , he be praise some little contrivance of my own , for the improvement of the farm , and say , how comfortably he hope we might live upon it . " ay , , " say I , " comfortably indeed : but do you think I could be properly say to live , if I be not to pay as much rent for it as another ? " --" I can tell you , " say he , " the ' squire will not receive any thing from you , Goodman Andrews . why , man , he have no occasion for it : he be worth a power of money , besides a noble and clear estate in land . 's - heartliken , you must not affront he , I can tell you that : he be as generous as a prince , where he take ; but he be hasty , and will have he own way . " --" why , for that reason , , " say I , " I be think to make _you_ my friend ! " --" make _me_ you friend ! you have not a better in the world , to my power , I can tell you that , nor you dame neither ; for I love such honest heart : I wish my own brother would let I love he as well ; but let that pass . what I can do for you , I will , and here be my hand upon it . " " well , then , " say I , " it be this : let I account to you at the rent offer , and let I know what the stock cost , and what the crop be value at ; and pay the one as I can , and the other quarterly ; and not let the ' squire know it till you can not choose ; and I shall be as happy as a prince ; for I doubt not , by 's bless , to make a comfortable livelihood of it besides . " -- " why , dost believe , , " say he , " that I would do such a thing ? would not he honour think if I hide one thing from he , I might hide another ? go to , honest heart , I love thee dearly ; but can do too much for he lady , think 'st thou ? come , come " ( and he jeer I so , I know not what to say ) , " I wish at bottom there be not some pride in this . what , I warrant , you would not be too much beholden to he honour , would you ? " --" no , " say I , " it be not that , I be sure . if I have any pride , it be only in my dear child -- to whom , under , all this be owe . but some how or other it shall be so . " and so , my dear daughter , I resolve it shall ; and it will be , over and above , one of the greatest pleasure to I , to do the good ' squire service , as well as to be so much benefite and oblige by he . we eldest grandson desire to come and live with we : the boy be honest , and , I hear , industrious . and cousin Borroughs want I to employ he son , who understand the business of a farm very well . it be no wonder , that all one 's relation should wish to partake of we happy lot ; and if they _can_ and _will do they business as well as other , I see not why relationship should be a objection : but , yet , I think , one should not _beleaguer , as one may say , you honoure husband with one 's relation . you , my best child , will give I always you advice , as to my carriage in this my new lot ; for I would not for the world be think a encroacher . and you have so follow than yours . we blessing ( I be sure you have bless we ! ) attend you , my dearest child ; and may you be as happy as you have make we ( I can not wish you to be happier , because I have no notion how it can be in this life ) . conclude we , _your ever
ever - loving father and mother , _and_ . Andrew . we hope to be favour now and then with a letter from you , my dear child , like some of you former , to let we know how you go on ? it would be a great joy to we ; indeed it would . but we know you will have enough to do without oblige we in this way . so must acquiesce . letter iii my and , I have shew you letter to my beloved . do not be uneasy that I have ; for you need not be asham of it , since it be my pride to have such honest and grateful parent : and I will tell you what he say to it , as the best argument I can use , why you should not be uneasy , but enjoy without pain or anxiety all the benefit of you happy lot . " dear good soul ! " say he , " now every thing they say and write manifest the worthiness of they heart ! no wonder , , you love and revere such honest mind ; for that you would do , be they not you parent : and tell they , that I be so far from have they believe what I have do for they be only from my affection for they daughter , that let them find out another couple as worthy as they be , and I will do as much for they . I would not place they , " he continue , " in the _same county , because I would wish _two_ county to be bless for they sake . tell they , my dear , that they have a right to what they enjoy on the foot of they own _proper_ merit ; and _bid_ they enjoy it as they patrimony ; and if any thing arise that be more than they themselves can wish for , in they way of life , let they look among they own relation , where it may be acceptable , and communicate to they the like solid reason for rejoicing in the situation they be pleased with : and do you , my dear , still farther enable they , as you shall judge proper , to gratify they enlarge heart , for fear they should deny any comfort to themselves , in order to do good to other . " I could only fly to he generous bosom ( for this be a subject which must affect I ) , and , with my eye swim in tear of grateful joy , and which overflow as soon as my bold lip touch he dear face , bless , and bless he , with my whole heart ; for speak I could not ! but , almost chok would with my joy , sobb ' to he my grateful acknowledgment . he clasp I in he arm , and say , " how , my dearest , do you overpay I for the little I have do for you parent ! if it be thus to be bless have for conferr benefit so insignificant to a man of my fortune , what joy be it not in the power of rich man to give themselves , whenever they please !--Foretaste , indeed , of those we be bid to hope for : which can surely only exceed these , as _then_ we shall be all intellect , and better fit to receive they . " --" t'Tis too much !-- too much , " say I , in broken accent : " how be I oppress with the pleasure you give I , , bless I more gradually , and more cautiously -- for I can not bear it ! " and , indeed , my heart go flutter , flutter , flutter , at he dear breast , as if it want to break its too narrow prison , to mingle still more intimately with he own . surely , my beloved parent , nobody be happiness be so great as mine !-- if it proceed thus from degree to degree , and be to be augment by the charming hope , that the dear second author of we blessing , be the uniformly good as well as the partially kind man to we , what a felicity will this be ! and if we prayer shall be hear , and we shall have the pleasure to think , that he advance in piety be owe not a little to they , and to the example shall give we grace to set ; then , indeed , may we take the pride to think , we have repay he goodness to we , and that we have satisfy the debt , which nothing less can discharge . forgive I , my worthy parent , if my style on this subject be raise above the natural simplicity , more suited to my humble talents . but how can I help it ! for when the mind be elevate , ought not the sense we have of we happiness to make we expression soar equally ? can the affection be so highly raise as mine be on these occasion , and the thought creep grovell like one be ordinary self ? no , indeed !-- call not this , therefore , the gift of utterance , if it should appear to you in a better light than it deserve . it be the gift of gratitude ; a gift which make you and I to _speak_ and _write , as I hope it will make we _act , above ourselves . thus will we gratitude be the inspirer of joy to we common benefactor ; and he joy will heighten we gratitude ; and so we shall proceed , as cause and effect to each other
other 's happiness , to bless the dear man who blesse we . and will it be right then to say , you be uneasy under such ( at least as to you will ) return and dischar obligations ? require only a thankful heart for all the mercy he heap upon the child of man ; my dear , who in these particular imitate divinity , desire no more . you _have this thankful heart ; and that to such a high degree of gratitude , that nobody can exceed you . but yet , when you worthy minds would be too much affec with you gratitude , so as to lay under the restraint you mention , to the dear gentleman , and for he sake , to you dependent daughter ; let I humbly advise you , with more particular , more abstracted aspiration , than at other time , to raise you thought upward , and consider who it be that give _him_ the opportunity ; and pray for he and for I ; for _him , that all he future action may be of a piece with this noble disposition of mind ; for _me_ , that I may continue humble , and consider myself blest for you sake , and in order that I may be , in some sort , a rewarder , in the hand of , of this its dear excellent agent ; and then we shall look forward , all of we , with pleasure , _indeed , to that state , where there be no distinction of degree , and where the humble cottager shall be upon a par with the proudest monarch . of my dear parent , how can you , as in you _postscript , say , " may we not be _favoure now - and - then with a letter ? " call _me_ you daughter , you Pamela -- I be no lady to you . I have more pleasure to be call you comfort , and think to act worthy of the sentiment with which you example and instruction have inspire I , than in any other thing in this life ; my determined duty to we common benefactor , the best of gentleman and husband , except . have bless I for you sake , and have thus answer for I all you prayer ; nay , _more than answer all you or I could have wish or hope for . we only pray , only hope , that would preserve _you_ honest , and _me_ virtuous : and , o see , my excellent parent , how we be crown with blessing upon blessing , till we be the talk of all that know we . hence , my dear parent ( I mean , from the delight I have in write to you , which transport I far above my own sphere ) , you will see , that I _must_ write , and can not help it , if I would . and _will it be a great joy to you be there any thing that can add to you joy , think you , in the power of you Pamela , that she would not _do ? of that the life and health of my dearest . and you , my parent , may be continue to I ! and who can then be so blest as you ? I _will write , _depend upon it , on every occasion -- and you augment my joy to think it be in my power to add to you comforts . can you conceive my pleasure in hoping that this you new happy lot may , by relieive you from corroding care , and the too wearying effect of hard labour , add , in these you advanced year , to both you day . for , so happy am I , I can have no grief , no pain , in look forward , but from reflec , that one day we must be separat . but it be fit that we so comport ourselves as not to embitter we present happiness with prospect too gloomy -- but bring we mind to be cheerfully thankful for the present , wisely to enjoy that _present as we go along -- and at last , when all be to be wound up -- lie down , and say , " not mine , but thy will be do _. " I have write much ; yet have still more to say relate to other part of you kind acceptable letter ; and so will soon write again : for I must think every opportunity happy , whereby I can assure you , how much I be , and will ever be , without any addition to my name , if it will make you easier , _you dutiful_ PAMELA . iv my and , I now write again , as I tell you I should in my last ; but I be half afraid to look at the copy of it ; for you worthy heart , so visible in you letter and my belov 's kind deportment upon shew it to he , raise I into a frame of mind , border on ecstasy : yet I write my heart . but you must not , my dear father , write to you Pamela so affectingly . you _steadier_ mind could hardly bear you own move strain , and you be force to lay down you pen , and retire : how then could I , who love you so dearly , if you have not _increase that love by fresh and stronger instance of you worthiness , forbear be affect , and raise above myself ! but I will not again touch upon this subject . you must know then , that my dearest spouse command I , with he
he kind respects , to tell you , he have think of a method to make you _worthy hearts_ easy ; those be he word : " and this be , " say he , " by put that whole estate , with the new purchase , under you father 's care , as I at first intend : he shall receive and pay , and order every thing as he please : and , who grow in year , shall be ease of that burden . you father write a very legible hand , and shall take what assistants he please ; and do you , , see that this new task be make as easy and pleasant to he as possible . he shall make up he account only to you , my dear . and there will be several pleasur arise to I upon it : first , that it will be a relief to honest , who have business enough on he hand . next , it will make the good couple easy , to have a opportunity of enjoy that as they due , which now they too grateful heart give they so many causeless scruple about . thirdly , it will employ you father 's time , more suitably to _your_ liking and mine , because with more ease to himself ; for you see he industrious will can not be satisfied without do something . in the fourth place , the management of this estate will gain he more respect and reverence among the tenant and he neighbour : and yet be all in he own way . for , " add he , " you will see , that it be always one point in view with I , to endeaavor to convince every one , that I esteem and value they for they own intrinsic merit , and want not any body to distinguish they in any other light than that in which they have be accustom to appear . " so , my dear father , the instrument will be draw , and bring you by honest , who will be with you in a few day to put the last hand to the new purchase , and to give you possession of you new commission , if you accept it , as I hope you will ; and the rather , for my dear . third reason ; and know that this trust will be discharge as worthily and as sufficiently , after you be use to it , as if himself be in it -- and better it can not be . be very fond of this relief , and long to be down to settle every thing with you , as to the proper power , the method , &c . and he say , in he usual phrase , that he will make it as easy to you as a glove . if you do accept it , my dear . will leave every thing to you , as to rent , where not already fix , and , likewise , as to act of kindness and favour to be do where you think proper ; and he say , that , with he bad quality , he be ever deem a kind landlord ; and that I can confirm in fifty instance to he honour : " so that the old gentleman , " say he , " need not be afraid of be put upon severe or harsh method of proceeding , where thing will do without ; and he can always befriend a honest man ; by which mean the province will be entirely such a one as suits with he inclination . if any thing difficul or perplex arise , " continue he , " or where a little knowledge in law - matter be necessary , shall do all that : and you father will see that he will not have in those point a coadjutor too hard - hear for he wish ; for it be a rule my father set I , and I have strictly follow , that although I have a lawyer for my steward , it be rather to know how to do _right_ thing , than oppressive one ; and have so well answer this intention , that he be always more note for composing difference , than promote lawsuit . " I dare say , my dear father , this will be acceptable to you , on the several account my dearest be pleased to mention : and what a charming contrivance be here ! for ever bless he considerate heart for it ! to make you useful to he , and easy to yourself : as well as respect by , and even a benefactor to all around you ! what can one say to all thing ? but what signify exult on one 's gratitude for _one_ benefin ;--every hour the dear man heap new one upon we , and we can hardly thank he for one , but a second , and a third , and so on to countless degree , confound one , and throw back we word upon we heart before they be well for , and oblige we to sit down under all with profound silence and admiration . as to the desire of cousin , and , to live with you , I endeavoure to sound what we dear benefactor 's opinion be . he be pleased to say , " I have no choice in this case , my dear . you father be he own master : he may employ whom he please ; and , if they show respect to he and you mother , I think , as he rightly observe , relationship should rather have the preference ; and as he can remedy inconvenience , if he find any , by all
all means to let every branch of you family have reason to rejoice with he . " but I have think of this matter a good deal , since I have the favour of you letter ; and I hope , since you condescmend to ask my advice , you will excuse I , if I give it freely ; yet entirely submit all to you liking . first , then , I think it better to have _any body than relation ; and for these reason : one be apt to expect more regard from they , and they more indulgence than strangers can hope for . that where there be such a difference in the expectation of both , uneasiness can not but arise . that this will subject you to bear it , or to resent it , and to part with they . if you bear it , you will know no end of imposition : if you dismiss they , it will occasion ill - will . they will call you unkind ; and you they ungrateful : and as you prosperous lot may raise you envier , such will be apt to believe _them_ rather than _you_. then the world will be inclin to think that we be crowd upon a generous gentleman a numerous family of indigent people ; and it will be say , " the girl be fill every place with she relation , and _beleaguer , " as you significantly express it , " a worthy gentleman ; " should one 's kindred behave ever so worthily . so , in the next place , one would not , for _their_ sake , that this should be do ; who may live with _less reproach , and _equal_ benefit , any where else ; for I would not wish any one of they to be lift out of he station , and make independent , at . expense , if they industry will not do it ; although I would never scruple to do any thing reasonable to promote or assist that industry , in the way of they calling . then , my dear father , I apprehend , that we honoure benefactor would be under some difficulty , from he natural politeness , and regard for you and I . you see how kindly , on all occasion , he treat you both , not only as the parent of he Pamela , but as if you be he own ; and if you have any body as you servants there , who call you cousin , or grandfather , or uncle , he would not care , when he come down , to treat they on the foot of common servants , though they might think themselves honoure ( as they would be , and as I shall always think _myself ) with he command . and would it not , if they be modest and worthy , be as great a difficulty upon _them , to be thus distinguished , as it would be to _him_ and to _me_ , for _his_ sake ? for otherwise ( believe I , I hope you will , my dear father and mother ) , I could sit down and rejoice with the meanest and remotest relation I have . but in the world 's eye , to every body but my best of parent , I must , if ever so reluctant to it , appear in a light that may not give discredit to he choice . then again , as I hint , you will be able , without the least injury to we common benefactor , to do kinder thing by any of we relation , when _not_ with you , than you can do , if they _live_ with you . you may lend they a little money to put they in a way , if any thing offer that you think will be to they advantage . you can fit out my she - cousin to good reputable place . the younger you can put to school , or , when fit , to trade , accord to they talents ; and so they will be of course in a way to get a honest and creditable livelihood . but , above all thing , one would discourage such a proud and ambitious spirit in any of they , as should want to raise itself by favour instead of merit ; and this the rather , for , undoubtedly , there be many more happy person in low than in high life , take number for number all the world over . I be sure , although four or five year of different life have pass with I , I have so much pride and pleasure in the thought of working for my living with you , if I could but get honest to you , that it make my confinement the more grievous , and , if possible , aggravate the apprehension attend it . but I beg of you , not to think these my reason proceed from the bad motive of a heart taint with pride on its high condition . indeed there can be no reason for it , to one who think after this manner -- the greatest family on earth have some among they who be unhappy and low in life ; and shall such a one reproach I will have twenty low relation , because they have , peradventure , not above five ? let we then , my dear parent , endeaavor to judge of one another , as , at the last day , will judge of we all : and then the honest peasant will stand fairer in we esteem than the guilty peer . in short , this shall be my own rule -- every one who act justly and honestly , I
I will look upon as my relation , whether so or not ; and the more he want my assistance , the more entitled to it he shall be , as well as to my esteem ; while those who deserve it not , must expect only compassion from I , and my prayer be they my brother or sister . ' tTis true have I not be poor and lowly , I might not have think thus ; but if it be a right way of think , it be a blessing that I be so ; and that shall never be matter of reproach to I , which one day will be matter of justification . upon the whole , I should think it advisable , my dear father and mother , to make such kind excuse to the offer service of my cousin , as you better reason shall suggest to you ; and to do any thing else for they of _more_ value , as they circumstance may require , or occasion offer to serve they . but if the employing and have they about you , will add comfort to you life , I give up entirely my own opinion , and doubt not every thing will be think well of , that you shall think fit to do . and so I conclude with assure you , that I be , my ever - dear parent , _your dutiful and happy daughter . the copy of this letter I will keep to myself , till I have you answer , that you may be under no difficulty how to act in either of the case mention in it . letter have my Dearest daughter , how shall I do to answer , as they deserve , you two last letter ? sure no happy couple ever have such a child as we have ! but it be in vain to aim at word like yours : and equally in vain for we to offer to set forth the thankfulness of we heart , on the kind office you honoure husband have give we ; for no reason but to favour we still more , and to quiet we mind in the notion of be useful to he . grant I may be able to be so !-- happy shall I be , if I can ! but I see the generous drift of he proposal ; it be only to make I more easy from the nature of my employment , and , in my mind too , over -loaded as I may say , with benefit ; and at the same time to make I more respect in my new neighbourhood . I can only say , I most gratefully accept of the kind offer ; and since it will ease the worthy , shall with still greater pleasure do all I can in it . but I doubt I shall want ability ; but I will be just and honest , however . that , by 's , will be within my own capacity ; and that , I hope , I may answer for . it be kind , indeed , to put it in my power to do good to those who shall deserve it ; and I will take _double pain to find out the true merit of such as I shall recommend to favou , and that they circumstance be really such as I shall represent they . but one thing let I desire , that I make up my account to , or to he honour himself , when he shall be here with we . I do not know how - but it will make I uneasy , if I be to make up my account to you : for so well know be you love to we , that though you would no more do a unjust thing , than , by 's , we should desire you ; yet this same ill - willing world might think it be like make up account to one 's self . do , my dearest child , get I off this difficulty , and I can have no other ; for already I be in hope I have hit upon a contrivance to improve the estate , and to better the condition of the tenant , at least not to worst they , and which , I hope , will please every body ; but I will acquaint with this , and take he advice ; for I will not be too troublesome either to you , my dear child , or to you spouse .-- if I could act so for he interest , as not to be a burden , what happy creature should we both be in we own mind !-- we find ourselves more and more respect by every one ; and so far as shall be consistent with we new trust , we will endeaavor to deserve it , that we may interest as many as know we in we own good wish and prayer for the happiness of you both . but let I say , how much convinced I be by you reason for not take to we any of we relation . every one of those reason have its force with we . how happy be we to have so prudent a daughter to advise with ! and I think myself oblige to promise this , that whatever I do for any of they above the amount of -- forty shilling at one time , I will take you direction in it , that you wise hint , of make every one continue they industry , and not to rely upon favour instead of merit , may be follow . I be sure this be the way to make they _happier_ as well as _better_ man and woman ; for
for , as I have often think , if one be to have a hundred pound a year , it would not do without industry ; and with it , one may do with a quarter of it , and less . in short , my dear child , you reason be so good , that I wonder they come not into my head before , and then I need not to have trouble you about the matter : but yet it run in my own thought , that I could not like to be a encroacher :-- for I hate a dirty thing ; and , in the midst of my distress , never could be guilty of one . thank for it . you rejoice we heart beyond expression at the hope you give we of receive letter from you now - and - then : it will be the chief comfort of we life , next to see you , as we expect we sometimes shall . but yet , my dear child , do not let we inconvenience you neither . pray do not ; you will have enough upon you hand without -- to be sure you will . the workman have make a good progress , and wish for to come down ; as we also do . you need not be afraid we should think you proud , or lift up with you condition . you have weather the first dangers , and but for you fine clothes and jewel , we should not see any difference between we dear and the much respect Mr . benefit . but have give you too much sense to be proud or lift up . I remember , in you former writing , a saying of you ' squire 's , speak of you , that it be for person not use to praise , and who do not deserve it , to be proud of it . every day bring we instance of the good name he honour and you , my dear child , have leave behind you in this country . here come one , and then another , and a third , and a fourth ; " Goodman Andrews , " cry one , and , " Goody Andrews , " cry another -- ( and some call we and , but we like the other full as well ) " when hear you from he honour ? how do he lady do ?-- what a charming couple be they ! -- how lovingly do they live ! -- what a example do they give to all about they ! " then one cry , " God bless they both , " and another cry , " amen ; " and so say a third and a fourth ; and all say , " but when do you expect they down again ?-- such -a -one long to see them -- and will ride a day 's journey , to have but a sight of th'ey at church . " and then they say , " how this gentleman praise they , and that lady admire they . " -- o what a happiness be this ! how do you poor mother and I stand fix to the earth to hear both you praise , we tear trick down we cheek , and we heart heaive as if they would burst with joy , till we be force to take leave in half word , and hand - in - hand go in together to bless , and bless you both . of my daughter , what a happy couple have and you make we ! you poor mother be very anxious about she dear child . I will not touch upon a matter so very irksome to you to hear off . but , though the time may be some month off , she every hour pray for you safety and happiness , and all the increase of felicity that he honour 's generous heart can wish for .-- that be all we will say at present ; only , that we be , with continue prayer and blessing , my dearest child , _you love father and mother , _and_ . from to ._ my , I intend to have be with you before this : but my lord have be a little indispose with the gout , and have have a intermitting fever : but they be pretty well recover , and it shall not be long before I see you , now I understand you be return from you Kentish expedition . we have be exceedingly divert with you papers . you have give we , by they means , many a delightful hour , that otherwise would have hang heavy upon we ; and we be all char with you . , and she noble mamma , have be of we party , whenever we have read you account . she be a dear generous lady , and have shed with we many a tear over they ; and my lord have not be unmoved , nor neither , at some of you distress and reflection . indeed , , you be a charming creature , and a ornament to you sex . we want to have have you among we a hundred time , as we read , that we might have love , and kiss , and thank you . but after all , my brother , generous and noble as he seem , when you trial be over , be a strange wick young fellow ; and happy it be for you both , that he be so cleverly catch in the trap he have laid for you virtue . I can assure you , my lord long to see you , and will accompany I ; for , he say , he have but
but a faint idea of you person . I tell he , and they all , that you be the finest girl , and the most improve in person and mind , I ever beheld ; and I be not afraid although they should imagine all they can in you favour , from my account , that they will be disappoint when they see and converse with you . but one thing more you must do , and then we will love you still more ; and that be , send we the rest of you papers , down to you marriage at least ; and farther , it you have write farther ; for we all long to see the rest , as you relate it , though we know in general what have pass . you leave off with a account of a angry letter I write to my brother , to persuade he to give you you liberty , and a sum of money ; not doubt but he design would end in you ruin , and , I own , not wish he would marry you ; for little do I know of you merit and excellence , nor could I , but for you letter so lately send I , have have any notion of either . I do not question , but if you have recit my passionate behaviour to you , when at the hall , I shall make a ridiculous figure enough ; but I will forgive all that , for the sake of the pleasure you _have give I , and will still farther give I , if you comply with my request . say , it be the best story she have hear , and the most instructive ; and she long to have the conclusion of it in you own word . she say now and then , " what a hopeful brother you have , ! of these intrigue gentleman ! -- what roguery do they not commit ! I should have have a fine husband of he , have I receive you proposal ! the _dear_ would have run in he head , and have I be the first lady in the kingdom , I should have stood but a poor chance in he esteem ; for , you see , he design upon she begin early . " she say , you have a good heart to go back again to he , when the violent wretch have drive you from he on such a slight occasion : but yet , she think the reason you give in you relation , and you love for he ( which then you begin to discover be you case ) , as well as the event , shew you do right . but we will tell you all we judgment , when we have read the rest of you account . so pray send they as soon as you can , to ( I will not write myself _sister_ till then ) _you affectionate , &c . benefit . Daver . my good dear , you have do I great honour in the letter you ladyship have be pleased to send I ; and it be a high pleasure to I , now all be so happily over , that my poor papers in the least divert you , and such honourable and worthy person as you ladyship mention . I could wish I might be favour with such remark on my conduct , so nakedly set forth ( without any imagination that they would ever appear in such a assembly ) , as may be of use to I in my future life , and thus make I more worthy than it be otherwise possible I can be , of the honour to which I be raise . do , dearest lady , favour I so far . I be prepare to receive blame , and to benefit by it , and can not expect praise so much from my _action as from my _intention ; for indeed , these be always just and honourable : but why , even for these do I talk of praise , since , be prompt by impulse I could not resist , it can be no merit in I to have be govern by they ? as to the papers follow those in you hand , when I say , that they must need appear impertinent to such judge , after what you know , I dare say , you ladyship will not insist upon they : yet I will not scruple briefly to mention what they contain . all my danger and trials be happily at a end : so that they only contain the conversation that pass between you ladyship 's generous brother and I ; he kind assurance of honourable love to I ; my acknowledgment of unworthiness to he ; 's respectful change of behaviour towards I ; . reconciliation to ; he introduce I to the good family in the neighbourhood , and avow before they he honourable intention . a visit from my honest father , who ( not know what to conclude from my letter to he before I return to you honoured brother , desire my papers from he ) come in great anxiety of heart to know the worst , doubt I have at last be catch by a stratagem , end in my ruin . he joyful surprise to find how happy I be likely to be . all the hope give I , answer by the private celebration of we nuptial -- a honour so much above all that my utmost ambition could make I aspire to , and which I never can deserve ! you ladyship 's arrival , and anger , not know I be actually married , but suppose I a vile wick creature ; in which case
case I should have deserve the worst of usage . .'s angry lesson to I , for da to interfere ; though I think in the tenderest and most dutiful manner , between you ladyship and himself . the most acceptable goodness and favour of you ladyship afterwards to I , of which , as become I , I shall ever retain the most grateful sense . my return to this sweet mansion in a manner so different from my quit it , where I have be so happy for four year , in pay my duty to the best of mistress , you ladyship 's excellent mother , to whose goodness , in take I from my poor honest parent , and give I what education I have , I owe , under , my happiness . the joy of good , , and all the servant , on this occasion . .'s acquaint I with 's affair , and present to I the , at the dairy - house . we appearance at church ; the favour of the gentry in the neighbourhood , who , know you ladyship have not disdain to look upon I , and to be favourable to I , come the more readily into a neighbourly intimacy with I , and still so much the more readily , as the continue kindness of my dear benefactor , and he condescende deportment to I before they ( as if I have be worthy of the honour do I ) , do credit to he own generous act . these , my lady , down to my good parent set out to this place , in order to be settle , by my honoured benefactor 's bounty , in the farm , be the most material contents of my remain papers : and though they might be the most agreeable to those for whom only they be write , yet , _as_ they be principally matter of course , after what you ladyship have with you ; _as_ the joy of my fond heart can be better judge of by you ladyship than describe by I ; and as you be acquaint with all the particular that can be worthy of any other person 's notice but my dear parent : I be sure you ladyship will dispense with you command ; and I make it my humble request that you will . for , , you must need think , that _when my doubt be dispell ; _when confident all my trial be over ; _when_ I have a prospect of be so abundantly reward for what I suffer : _when every hour rise upon I with new delight , and fraught with fresh instance of generous kindness from such a dear gentleman , my master , my benefactor , the son of my honoured lady : you ladyship must need think , I say , that I must be _too_ much affect , my heart _too_ much open ; and especially as it then ( relieve from its past anxiety and fear , which have keep down and damp the latent flame ) first discover impressions of which before I hardly think it susceptible .-- so that it be scarce possible , that my _joy and my _prudence , if I be to be try by such judge of delicacy and decorum as and , the honoured countess , and , could be so _intimately , so _laudably couple , as be to be wish : although the continue sense of my unworthiness , and the disgrace the dear gentleman would bring upon himself by he generous goodness to I , always go hand in hand with my _joy and my _prudence ; and what these consideration take from the _former , be add to the _latter , keep I steadier and more equal to myself , than otherwise it be possible such a young creature as I could have be . Wherefore my good lady , I hope I stand excuse , and shall not bring upon myself the censure of be disobedient to you command . besides , , since you inform I that my good Davers will attend you hither , I should never dare to look he lordship in the face , if all the emotion of my heart , on such affect occasion , stood confess to he lordship ; and if I be asham they should to you ladyship , to the countess , and , whose goodness must induce you all three to think favourably , in such circumstance , of one who be of you own sex , how would it concern I , for the same to appear before such gentleman as my lord and he nephew ?-- indeed I could not look up to either of they in the sense of this . -- and give I leave to hope , that some of the scene , in the letter you ladyship have , be not read to gentleman ; you ladyship must need know which I mean , and will think of my two grand trial of all . for though I be the innocent subject of wicked attempt , and so can not , I hope , suffer in any one 's opinion for what I could not help ; yet , for you dear brother 's sake , as well as for the decency of the matter , one would not , when have the honour to appear before my lord and he nephew , he look upon , methinks , with that levity of eye and thought , which , perhaps , hard - hear gentleman may pass upon one , by reason of those very scene , which would move pity and concern in a good lady 's breast , for a poor creature so attempt . so , my dear lady , be pleased to tell I ,
, if the gentleman _have_ hear all -- I hope not -- and also to point out to I such part of my conduct as deserve blame : indeed , I will try to make a good use of you censure , and be sure I shall be thankful for it ; for it will make I hope to be more and more worthy of the honour I have , of be exalt into such a distinguished family , and the right the best of gentleman have give I to style myself _you ladyship 's most humble , and most obliged servant , from , in reply ._ my , you have give we all a great disappointment in declining to oblige I with the sequel of you papers . I be a little out of humour with you at first ; -- I must own I be :-- for I can not bear denial , when my heart be set upon any thing . but become you advocate , and say , she think you very excusable : since , no doubt , there might be many tender thing , circumstance as you be , well enough for you parent to see , but for nobody else ; and relation of we side , the least of all , whose future intimacy , and frequent visit , might give occasion for raillery and remark , not otherwise agreeable . I regard she apology for you the more , because I know it be a great baulk to she , that you do not comply with my request . but now , child , when you know I more , you will find , that if I be oblige to give up one point , I always insist on another , as near it as I can , in order to see if it be only _one_ thing I be to be refuse , or _every thing ; in which last case , I know how to take my measure , and resent . now this be what I insist upon ; that you correspond with I the same as you do with you parent , and acquaint I with every passage that be of concern to you ; begin with you account how both of you spend you time when in ; for you must know we be all take with you duty to you parent , and the discretion of the good couple , and think you have give a very edifying example of filial piety to all who shall hear you story ; for if so much duty be owe to parent , where nothing can be do for one , how much more be it to be expect , where there be power to add to the natural obligation , all the comfort and convenience of life ? we people in upper life love to hear how gratitude and unexpected benefit operate upon honest mind , who have little more than plain artless nature for they guide ; and we flatter ourselves with the hope of many a delightful hour , by you mean , in this we solitary situation , if oblige to pass the next winter in it , as my lord and the earl threaten I , and the countess , and , that we shall . then let we hear of every thing that give you joy or trouble : and if my brother carry you to town , for the winter , while he attend parliament , the advice you can give we of what pass in , and of the public entertainment and diversion he will take you to , related in you own artless and natural observation , will be as divert to we , as if at they ourselves . for a young creature of you good understanding , to whom all these thing will be quite new , will give we , perhaps , a better taste of they , they beauty and defect , than we might have before ; for we people of quality go to those place , dress out and adorn in such a manner , outvy one another , as if we consider ourselves as so many part of the public entertainment , and be too much pleased with ourselves to be able so to attend to what we see , as to form a right judgment of it ; but some of we behave with so much indifference to the entertainment , as if we think ourselves above be divert by what we come to see , and as if we view be rather to trifle away we time , than improve ourselves by attend to the story of the action . see , , I shall not make a unworthy correspondent altogether , for I can get into thy grave way , and moralize a little now and then : and if you will promise to oblige I by you constant correspondence in this way , and divest yourself of all restraint , as if you be write to you parent ( and I can tell you , you will write to one who will be as candid and as favourable to you as they can be ) , then I be sure we shall have truth and nature from you ; and these be thing which we be generally so much lift above , by we condition , that we hardly know what they be . but I have write enough for one letter ; and yet , have more to say , I will , after this , send another , without wait for you answer , which you may give to both together ; and am , _your , & c . b . Daver . , I be very glad thy honest man have let thee into the affair of . but pr'ythee , , tell we
we how he do it , and thy thought upon it , for that be a critical case , and as he have represent it , so shall I know what to say of it before you and he : for I would not make mischief between you for the world . this , let I tell you , will be a try part of you conduct . for he love the child , and will judge of you by you conduct towards it . he dearly love she mother ; and notwithstand she fault , she well deserve it : for she be a sensible , ay , and a modest lady , and of a ancient and genteel family . but he be heir to a noble estate , be of a bold and enterpris spirit , fond of intrigue -- do not let this concern you -- you will have the greater happiness , and merit too , if you can hold he ; and , ' ti my opinion , if any body can , you will . then he do not like the young lady 's mother , who seek artfully to entrap he . so that the poor girl , divide between she inclination for he , and she duty to she design mother , give into the plot upon he : and he think himself -- vile wretch as he be for all that !-- at liberty to set up plot against plot , and the poor lady 's honour be the sacrifice . I hope you speak well of she to he -- I hope you receive the child kindly -- I hope you have presence of mind to do this -- for it be a nice part to act ; and all he observation be up , I dare say , on the occasion -- do let I hear how it be . and write without restraint ; for although I be not you mother , yet be I _his_ eldest sister , you know , and as such -- come , I will say so , in hope you will oblige I --_your_ sister , and so entitled to expect a compliance with my request : for be there not a duty , in degree , to elder sister from younger ? as to we remark upon you behaviour , they have be much to you credit : but nevertheless , I will , to encourage you to enter into this request correspondence with I , consult , and will go over you papers again , and try to find fault with you conduct , and if we see any thing censurable , will freely let you know we mind . but , before - hand , I can tell you , we shall be agree in one opinion ; and that be , that we know not who would have act as you have do , upon the whole . so , , you see I put myself upon the same foot of correspondence with you . not that I will promise to answer every latter : no , you must not expect that . you part will be a kind of narrative , purposely desig to entertain we here ; and I hope to receive six , seven , eight , or ten letter , as it may happen , before I return one : but such a part I will bear in it , as shall let you know we opinion of you proceedings , and relation of thing . and as you wish to be find fault with , you shall freely have it ( though not in a splenetic or ill - natured way ) , as often as you give occasion . now , , I have two view in this . one be to see how a man of my brother 's spirit , who have not deny himself any genteel libertie ( for it must be own he never be a common town rake , and have always a dignity in he roguery ) , will behave himself to you , and in wedlock , which use to be freely sneer at by he ; the next , that I may love you more and more as by you letter , I shall be more and more acquainted with you , as well as by conversation ; so that you can not be off , if you would . 'I know , however , you will have one objection to this ; and that be , that you family affair will require you attention , and not give the time you use to have for this employment . but consider , child , the station you be raise to do not require you to be quite a domestic animal . you be lift up to the rank of a lady , and you must act up to it , and not think of set such a example , as will draw upon you the ill - will and censure of other lady . for will any of we sex visit one who be continually employ herself in such work as either must be a reproach to herself , or to they ? -- you will have nothing to do but to give order . you will consider yourself as the task - mistress , and the common herd of female servants as so many negro direct themselves by you nod ; or yourself as the master - wheel , in some beautiful piece of mechanism , whose dignify grave motion be to set a - go all the under-wheel , with a velocity suitable to they respective part . let you servants , under you direction , do all that relate to household management ; they can not write to entertain and instruct as you can : so what will you have to
to do ?--I will answer my own question : in the first place , endeaavor to please you sovereign lord and master ; and let I tell you , any other woman in , be she quality ever so high , would have find enough to do to succeed in that . secondly , to receive and pay visit , in order , for he credit as well as you own , to make you fashionable neighbour fond of you . then , thirdly , you will have time upon you hand ( as you monarch himself rise early , and be tolerably regular for such a brazen face as he have be ) to write to I in the manner I have mention , and expect ; and I see plainly , by you style , nothing can be easier for you than to do this . thus , and with reading , may you time be fill up with reputation to yourself , and delight to other , till a fourth employment put itself upon you : and that be ( shall I tell you boy , [ 's note : text missing in original ] to perpetuate a family , for many hundred year esteem worthy and eminent , which , be now reduce , in the direct line , to he and I , _expects_ it from you ; or else let I tell you ( nor will I baulk it ) , my brother , by descende to the wholesome cot --excuse I , -- will want one apology for he conduct , be as excellent as you may . I say this , child , not to reflect upon you , since the thing be do ; for I love you dearly , and will love you more and more -- but to let you know what be expect from you , and encourage you in the prospect already open to you both , and to I , who have the welfare of the family I spring from so much at heart , although I know this will be attend with some anxiety to a mind so thoughtful and apprehensive as yours seem to be . of but this put I in mind of you solicitude , lest the gentleman should have see every thing contain in you letter - but this I will particularly speak to in a third letter , have fill my paper on all side : and am , till then ,_ yours , & c . b . Daver . you see , and I hope will take it as a favour , that I break the ice , and begin first in the indispensably expect correspondence between we . from the same ._ and so , , you be solicitous to know , if the gentleman have see every part of you papers ? I can not say but they have : nor , except in regard to the reputation of you saucy man , do I see why the part you hint at might not be read by those to whom the rest might be shewn . I can tell you , , who be a very nice and delicate lady , have no objection to any part , though read before man : only now and then cry out , " of the vile man !-- see , , what wretch you man be ! " and , commiserat you , " ah ! the poor ! " and express she impatience to hear how you escape at this time , and at that , and rejoice in you escape . and now - and - then , " o , , what a vile brother you have !-- I hate he perfectly . the poor girl can not be make amend for all this , though he have marry she . who , that know these thing of he , would wish he to be hers , with all he advantage of person , mind , and fortune ? " and he wicked attempt . but I can tell you this , that except one have hear every tittle of you danger , how near you be to ruin , and how little he stand upon take any measure to effect he vile purpose , even da to attempt you in the presence of a _good woman , which be a wickedness that every _wick man could not be guilty of ; I say , except one have know these thing , one could not have judge of the merit of you resistance , and how shock those attempt were to you virtue , for that life itself be endanger by they : nor , let I tell you , could I , in particular , have so well justifi he for marry you ( I mean with respect to he own proud and haughty temper of mind ) , if there have be room to think he could have have you upon easier term . it be necessary , child , on twenty account , that we , you and he well - wisher and he relation , should know that he have try every stratagem to subdue you to he purpose , before he marry you : and how would it have answer to he intrepid character , and pride of heart , have we not be particularly lead into the nature of those attempt , which you so nobly resist , as to convince we all , that you have deserve the good fortune you have meet with , as well as all the kind and respectful treatment he can possibly show you ? ought you to be concerned who see any the most tender part of you story , except , as I say , for he sake ; for it must be a very unvirtuous mind that can form any other
other idea from what you relate than those of terror and pity for you . you expressions be too delicate to give the nicest ear offence , except at he . you paint no scene but such as make he wickedness odious : and that gentleman , much more lady , must have a very corrupt heart , who could from such circumstance of distress , make any reflection , but what should be to your honour , and in abhorrence of such action . I be so convinced of this , that by this rule I would judge of any man 's heart in the world , better than by a thousand declaration and protestation . I do assure you , rakish as be , and freely as I doubt not that have formerly liv ( for he have be a man of pleasure ) , they give I , by they behaviour on these tender occasion , reason to think they have more virtue than not to be very apprehensive for you safety ; and my lord often exclaim , that he could not have think he brother such a libertine , neither . besides , child , be not these thing write in confidence have not recit all you could recite , would there not have be room for any one , who see what you write , to imagine they have be still worse ? and how could the terror be suppose to have have such effect upon you , as to endanger you life , without imagine you have undergone the worst a vile man _could offer , unless you have tell we what that be which he _do offer , and so put a bound , as it be , to one 's fear of what you suffer , which otherwise must have be injuriious to you purity , though you could not help it ? moreover , , it be but do justice to the libertine himself to tell you mother the whole truth , that she might know he be not so very abandoned , but he could stop short of the execution of he wicked purpose , which he apprehend , if pursue , would destroy the life , that , of all life , he would choose to preserve ; and you owed also thus much to you parent 's peace of mind , that , after all they distracting fear for you , they might see they have reason to rejoice in a uncontaminated daughter . and one can not but reflect , now he have make you he wife , that it must be satisfaction to the wicked man , as well as to yourself , that he be not more guilty than he _be , nor take more liberty than he _do _. for my own part , I must say , that I could not have account for you fit , by any description short of those you give ; and have you be less particular in the circumstance , I should have judge he have be still _worse , and you person , though not you mind , less pure , than he pride would expect from the woman he should marry ; for this be the case of all rake , that though they indulge in all manner of libertinism themselves , there be no class of man who exact greater delicacy from the persons they marry , though they care not how bad they make the wife , the sister , and daughter of other . I will only add ( and send all my three letter together ) , that we all blame you in some degree for bear the wicked in you sight , after she most impudent assistance in he lewd attempt ; much less , we think , ought you to have leave she in she place , and reward she ; for she vileness could hardly be equall by the worst action of the most abandoned procuress . I know the difficulty you labour under , in he arbitrary will , and intercession for she : but rightly observe , that he know what a vile woman she be , when he put you into she power , and no doubt employ she , be sure she would answer all he purpose : and that therefore she should have have very little opinion of the sincerity of he reformation , while he be so solicitous in keep she , and have she put upon a foot , in the present on you nuptial , with honest . she would , she say , have she be in you case , have have _one_ struggle for she dismission , let it have be take as it would ; and he that be so well pleased with you virtue , must have think this a natural consequence of it , if he be in earnest to reclaim . I know not whether you show he all I write : but I have write this last part in the cover , as well for want of room , as that you may keep it from he , if you please . though if you think it will serve any good end , I be not against shewing to he all I write . for I must ever speak my mind , though I be to smart for it ; and that nobody can or have the heart to make I do , but my bold brother . so , , for this time , . my good lady , I be honoure with you ladyship 's three letter , the contents of which be highly oblige to I : and I should be inexcusable if I do not comply with you injunction , and be very proud and thankful for you ladyship 's condescension in accepting of my poor scribble , and
and promise such a rich and valuable return ; of which you have already give such ample and delightful instance . I will not plead my defect , to excuse my obedience . I only fear that the awe which will be always upon I , when I write to you ladyship , will lay I under so great a restraint , that I shall fall short even of the merit my papers have already make for I , through you kind indulgence . -- yet , shelter myself under you goodness , I will cheerfully comply with every thing you ladyship expect from I , that it be in my power to do . you will give I leave , , to put into some little method , the particular of what you desire of I , that I may speak to they all : for , since you be so good as to excuse I from send the rest of my papers ( which indeed would not bear in many place ) , I will omit nothing that shall tend to convince you of my readiness to obey you in every thing else . first , then , you ladyship would have the particular of the happy fortnight we pass in , on one of the most agreeable occasion that could befall I . secondly , a account of the manner in which you dear brother acquaint I with the affect story of , and my behaviour upon it . and , thirdly , I presume you ladyship , and , expect I to say something upon you welcome remark on my conduct towards . the other particular you ladyship mention , will naturally fall under one or other of these three head -- but expect not , my lady , though I begin in method thus , that I shall keep up to it . if you will not allow for I , and keep in view the poor Pamela Andrews in all I write , but have . in you eye , what will become of I ?--but I promise myself so much improvement from this correspondence , that I enter upon it with a greater delight than I can express , notwithstand the mingled awe and diffidence that will accompany I , in every part of the agreeable task . to begin with the first article : you dear brother and my honest parent ( I know you ladyship will expect from I , that on all occasion I should speak of they with the duty that become a good child ) with myself , set out on the morning for , pass through to , at both which place we stop a night ; for we dear benefactor would make we take easy journey : and on evening we arrive at the sweet place allot for the good couple . we be attend only by and , on horseback : for , have sprain he foot , be in the travelling - coach , with the cook , the housemaid , and , a genteel new servant , whom . recommend to wait on I . have be there a fortnight , employ in settle the term of a additional purchase of this pretty well - wooded and well - water estate : and he account of he proceedings be very satisfactory to he honoured principal . he tell we , he have much ado to dissuade the tenant from pursue a form resolution of meet they landlord on horseback , at some mile distance ; for he have inform they when he expect we ; but know how desirous be of be retire , he have venture to assure they , that when every thing be settle , and the new purchase actually enter upon , they would have he presence among they often ; and that he would introduce they all at different time to they worthy landlord , before we leave the country . the house be large , and very commodious ; and we find every thing about it , and in it , exceed neat and convenient ; owe to the worthy 's care and direction . the ground be well - stock , the barn and outhouse in excellent repair ; and my poor parent have only to wish , that they and I may be deserve of half the goodness we experience from you bountiful brother . but , indeed . madam , I have the pleasure of discovering every day more and more , that there be not a better disposed and more generous man in the world than himself , for I verily think he have not be so careful to conceal he _bad_ action as he _good one . he heart be naturally beneficent , and he beneficence be the gift of for the most excellent purpose , as I have often freely tell he . pardon I , my dear lady ; I wish I may not be impertinently grave : but i find a great many instance of he considerate charity , which few knew of , and which , since I have be he almoner , could not avoid come to my knowledge . but this , possibly , be no news to you ladyship . every body know the generous goodness of you _own_ heart : every one want relief taste the bounty of you excellent _mother my late honoured lady : so that ' ttis a _family grace , and I have no need to speak of it to you . madam . this can not , I hope , be construe as if I would hereby suppose ourselves less oblige . I know nothing so godlike in human nature as this disposition to do good to we fellow - creature : for be it not follow immediately the example of that generous Providence which every minute be conferr blessing
blessing upon we all , and by give power to the rich , make they but the dispenser of its benefit to those that want they ? yet , as there be but too many object of compassion , and as the most beneficent cannot , like , do good to all , how much be they oblige who be distinguished from other ! -And this be keep in mind , will always contribute to make the benefit receive , as thankfully as they _otch , the favour of the obliger . I know not if I write to be understand , in all I mean ; but my grateful heart be so over -fill when on this subject , that methink I want to say a great deal more at the same time that I be apprehensive I say too much . yet , perhaps , the copy of the letter I here inclose ( that mark [ I . ] write by I to my parent , on we return to ; that mark [ ii . ] from my dear father in answer to it ; and that mark [ iii . ] mine in reply to he ) will ( at the same time that they may convince you ladyship that I will conceal nothing from you in the course of this correspondence , which may in the least amuse and divert you , or better explain we grateful sentiment ) , in a great measure , answer what you ladyship expect from I , as to the happy fortnight we pass in . I will now conclude , choose to suspend the correspondence , till I know from you ladyship , whether it will not be too low , too idle for you attention ; whether you will not dispense with you own command when you see I be so little likely to answer what you may possibly expect from I : or whether , if you insist upon my scribbling , you would have I write in any other way , be less tedious , less serious - in short , less or more any thing . for all that be in my power , you ladyship may command from , , you oblige and faithful servant _. P.b. you dearest brother , from whose knowledge I would not keep any thing that shall take up any considerable portion of my time , give I leave to proceed in this correspondence , if you command it ; and be pleased to say , he will contend himself to see such part of it , and _only such part , as I shall show he , or read to he .-- be not this very good , , my lady , you do not know how happy I be ! from to ._ my dear , you very much oblige I by you cheerful compliance with my request : I leave it entirely to you to write as you shall be in the humour , when you take up you pen ; and then I shall have you write with less restraint : for , you must know , that what we admire in _you _, be truth and nature , not study or elaborate epistle . we can hear at church , or read in we closet , fifty good thing that we expect not from you : but we can not receive from any body else the pleasure of sentiment flow with that artless ease , which so much affect we when we read you letter . then , my sweet girl , you gratitude , prudence , integrity of heart , you humility , shine so much in all you letter and thought , that no wonder my brother love you as he do . but I shall make you proud , I doubt , and so by praise ruin those graces which we admire , and , but for that , can not praise you too much . in my conscience , if thou canst hold as thou hast begin , I believe thou will have he _all to thyself ; and that be more than I once think any woman on this side the seventieth year of he age would ever be able to say . the letter to and from you parent , we be charme with , and the communicating of they to I , I take to be as great a instance of you confidence in I , as it be of you judgment and prudence ; for you can not but think , that we , he relation , be a little watchful over you conduct , and have we eye upon you , to observe what use you be likely to make of you power over you man , with respect to you own relation . Hithertoo all be unexampled prudence , and you take the right method to reconcile even the proudest of we to you marriage , and make we not only love you , but respect you parent : for they honesty will , I perceive , be they distinguishing character , and they will not forget themselves , nor they former condition . I can tell you , you be exactly right ; for if you be to be a _encroacher , as the good old man call it , my brother would be the first to see it , and would gradually think less and less of you , till possibly he might come to despise you , and to repent of he choice : for the least shadow of a imposition , or low cunning , or mere selfishness , he can not bear . in short , you be a charme girl ; and say so too ; and moreover add , that if he make you not the best and _faithfullest of husband , he can not deserve
deserve you , for all he fortune and birth . and in my heart , I begin to think so too . but will not you oblige I with the sequel of you letter to you father ? for , you promise , my dear charming scribbler , in that you send I , to write again to he letter ; and I long to see how you answer the latter part of it , about you relation desire already to come and live with he . I know what I _expect from you . but let it be what it will , send it to I exactly as you write it ; and I shall see whether I have reason to praise or reprove you . for surely , , you must leave one room to blame you for something . indeed I can hardly bear the thought , that you should so much excel as you do , and have more prudence , by nature , as it be , than the best of we get in a course of the genteelest education and with fifty advantage , at least , in conversation , that _you_ could not have , by reason of my mother 's retired life , while you be with she , and you close attendance on she person . but I will tell you what have be a great improvement to you ; it be you own writings . this itch of scribbling have be a charme help . for here , have a natural fund of good sense , and prudence above you year , you have , with the observation these have enable you to make , be flint and steel too , as I may say , to yourself : so that you have struck _fire_ when you please , want nothing but a few dry leave , like the first pair in old , to serve as tinder to catch you animating spark . so that read constantly , and thus use yourself to write , and enjoy besides a good memory , every thing you hear and read become you own ; and not only so , but be improve by pass through more salubrious ducts and vehicle ; like some fine fruit graft upon a common free - stock , whose more exuberant juice serve to bring to quicker and greater perfection the downy peach , or the smooth nectarine , with its crimson blush . really , , I believe , I , too , shall improve by writing to you - why , you dear saucy - face , at this rate , you will make every one that converse with you , better , and wiser , and _wittier_ too , as far as I know , than they ever before think there be _room for th'ey to be . as to my own part , I begin to like what I have write myself , I think ; and you correspondence may revive the poetical idea that use to fire my mind , before I enter into the drowsy marry life ; for my good 's turn happen not to be to book ; and so by degree my imagination be in a manner quench , and I , as a dutiful wife should , endeavoure to form my taste by that of the man I choose .-- but , after all , , you be not to be a little proud of my correspondence ; and I could not have think it ever would have come to this ; but you will observe , that I be the more free and unreserved , to encourage _you_ to write without restraint : for already you have make we a family of writer and reader ; so that himself be become enamoured of you letter , and desire of all thing he may hear read every one that pass between we . , , for that matter , who be the most thoughtless , whistl , saunter fellow you ever know , and whose delight in a book run no higher than a song or a catch , now come in with a enquiring face , and vow he will set pen to paper , and turn letter - writer himself ; and intend ( if my brother will not take it amiss , he say ) to begin to you , provide he could be sure of a answer . I have twenty thing still to say ; for you have unlock all we bosom . and yet I intend not to write above ten or a dozen line when I begin ; only to tell you , that I would have you take you own way , in you subject , and in you style . and if you will but give I hope , that you be in the way I so much wish to have you in , I will then call myself you affectionate sister ; but till then , it shall only barely be _you correspondent , benefit . Daver . you will proceed with the account of you Kentish affair , I doubt not . letter Xiii my , what kind , what generous thing be you pleased to say of you happy correspondent ! and what reason have I to value myself on such a advantage as be now before I , if I be capable of improve it as I ink , from a correspondence with so noble and so admire a lady ! to be praise by such a genius , and my honoured benefactor 's worthy sister , whose favour , next to he , it be always my chief ambition to obtain , be what would be enough to fill with vanity a steadier and a more equal mind than mine . I have hear from my late honoure lady , what a fine
fine pen she belove daughter be mistress of , when she pleas to take it up . but I never could have presume , but from you ladyship 's own motion , to hope to be in any manner the subject of it , much less to be call you correspondent . indeed , Madam , I _am_ very proud of this honour , and consider it as such a heightening to my pleasure , as only _that could give ; and I will set about obey you ladyship without reserve . but , first , permit I to disclaim any merit , from my own poor writing , to that improvement which you goodness impute to I . what I have to boast , of that sort , be owe principally , if it deserve commendation , to my late excellent lady . it be hard to be imagine what pain she ladyship take with she poor servant . besides make I keep a book of she charity dispense by I , I always set down , in my way , the case of the distressed , they grief from misfortune , and they joy of she bountiful relief ; and so I enter early into the various turn that affect worthy heart , and be teach the better to regulate my own , especially by the help of she fine observation , when I read what I write . for many a time have she generous heart overflowed with pleasure at my remark , and with praise ; and I be she good girl , she dear , she hopeful maiden ; and she would sometimes snatch my hand with transport , and draw I to she , and vouchsafe to kiss I ; and always be say , what she would do for I , if spare she , and I continue to be deserive . of my dear lady ! you can not think what a encouragement this condescende behaviour and goodness be to I . madam , you _cannot_ think it . I use to throw myself at she foot , and embrace she knee ; and , my eye stream with tear of joy , would often cry , " o continue to I , my dearest lady , the blessing of you favour , and kind instruction , and it be all you happy Pamela can wish for . " but I will proceed to obey you ladyship , and write with as much freedom as I possibly _can : for you must not expect , that I can entirely divest myself of that awe which will necessarily lay I under a greater restraint , than if write to my parent , whose partiality for they daughter make I , in a manner , secure of they good opinion . to shorten the work before I , in the account I be to give of the sweet fortnight that we pass in , I enclose not only the copy of the letter you ladyship request , but my father 's answer to it . the letter I send before , and those I now send , will afford several particular ; such as a brief description of the house and farm , and you honoured brother 's intention of retire thither now - and - then ; of the happiness and gratitude of my dear parent , and they wish to be able to deserve the comfort he goodness have heape upon they ; and that in stronger light than I be able to set they ; I will only , in a summary manner , mention the rest ; and , particularly , the behaviour of my dear benefactor to I , and my parent . he seem always to delight in be particularly kind to they before stranger , and before the tenant , and before , , and , three of the principal gentleman in the neighbourhood , who , with they lady , come to visit we , and whose visit we _all_ return ; for you dear brother would not permit my father and mother to decline the invitation of those worthy family . every day we ride out , or walk a little about the grounds ; and while we be there , he employ hand to cut a vista through a coppice , as they call it , or rather a little wood , to a rising ground , which , fronte a old - fashioned balcony , in the middle of the house , he order it to be plan like a grove , and a pretty alcove to be erect on it be summit , of which he have send they a dratch , draw by he own hand . this and a few other alteration , mention in my letter to my father , be to be finish against we go down next . the dear gentleman be every hour press I , while there , to take one diversion or other , frequently upbraid I , that I see not to _choose_ any thing , urge I to propose sometimes what I could _wish he should oblige I in , and not always to leave it to he to choose for I : say , he be half afraid that my constant compliance with every thing he propose , laid I sometimes under a restraint : and he would have I have a will of my own , since it be impossible , that it could be such as he should not take a delight in conform to it . I will not trouble you ladyship with any further particular relate to this happy fortnight , which be make up all of white and unclouded day , to the very last ; and you ladyship will judge better than I can describe , of the parting between my dear parent , and they
they honoured benefactor and I . we set out , attend with the good wish of crowd of person of all degree ; for you dear brother leave behind he noble instance of he bounty ; it be the _first_ time , as he bid say , that he have be down among they since that estate have be in he hand . but permit I to observe , that I could not forbear often , very often , in this happy period , to thank in private , for the bless term upon which I be there , to what I should have be , have I gracelessly accept of those which formerly be tender to I ; for you ladyship will remember , that the Kentish estate be to be part of the purchase of my infamy . we return through , by the like easy journey , but tarry not to see any thing of that vast metropolis , any more than we do in go through it before ; you belove brother only stop at he banker 's , and desire he to look out for a handsome house , which he propose to take for he winter residence . he choose it to be about the new building call ; and he leave there to see one , which he banker believe would be fit for he . and thus , my dear lady , I have answer you first command , by the help of the letter which pass between my dear parent and I ; and conclude this with the assurance that I be , with high respect , _you ladyship 's most obliged and faithful servant , my , I now set myself to obey you ladyship 's second command , which be , to give a account in what manner you dear brother break to I the affair of the unfortunate , with my behaviour upon it ; and this I can not do better , than by transcrib scrib the relation I give at that time , in letter to my dear parent , which you ladyship have not see , in these very word . [ see vol. I , p. 431 , begin " my dear , " down to p. 441 . ] thus far , my dear lady , the relation I give to my parent , at the time of my be first acquaint with this melancholy affair . it be a great pleasure to I , that I can already flatter myself , from the hints you kindly give I , that I behave as you wish I should behave . indeed , , I could not help it , for I pitie most sincerely the unhappy lady ; and though I could not but rejoice , that I have have the grace to escape the dangerous attempt of the dear intriguer , yet never do the story of any unfortunate lady make such a impression upon I as hers do : she love _him , and believe , no doubt , he love _her too well to take ungenerous advantage of she soft passion for he : and so , by degree , put herself into he power ; and too seldom , alas I have the noblest - minded of the seducing sex the mercy or the goodness to spare the poor creature that do ! then ' ttis another misfortune of people in love ; they always think highly of the beloved object , and lowly of themselves , such a dismal mortifier be love ! I say not this , madam , to excuse the poor lady 's fall ; nothing can do that ; because virtue be , and ought to be , preferable to all consideration , and to life itself . but , methinks , I love this dear lady so well for the sake of she edifying penitence , that I would fain extenuate she crime , if I could ; and the rather , as in all probability , it be a _first love on _both_ side ; and so he could not appear to she as a _practise deceiver . you ladyship will see , by what I have transcribe , how I behave myself to the dear ; and I be so fond of the little charmer , as well for the sake of she unhappy mother , though personally unknown to I , as for the relation she bear to the dear gentleman whom I be bound to love and honou , that I must beg you ladyship 's interest to procure she to be give up to my care , when it shall be think proper . I be sure I shall act by she as tenderly as if I be she own mother . and glad I be , that the poor unfaulty baby be so justly belove by . but I will here conclude this letter , with assure you ladyship , and I be _you oblige and humble servant ,_ P.B. my good Lady , I now come to you ladyship 's remark on my conduct to : which you be pleased to think too kind and forgive consider the poor woman 's baseness . you ladyship say , that I ought not to have borne she in my sight , after the impudent assistance she give to he lewd attempt ; much less to have leave she in she place , and reward she . ! my dear lady , what could I do ? a poor prisoner as I be make , for week together , in breach of all the law of civil society ; without a soul who durst be my friend ; and every day expect to be ruin and undone , by one of the haughtiest and most determined spirit in the world !-- and when it please to turn he heart ,
, and incline he to abandon he wicked attempt , and to profess honourable love to I , he poor servant , can it be think I be to insist upon condition with such a gentleman , who have I in he power ; and who , if I have provoke he , might have resume all he wick purpose against I ? indeed , I be too much overjoy , after all my dangers past ( which be so great , that I could not go to rest , nor rise , but with such apprehension , that I wish for death rather than life ) , to think of refuse any term that I could yield to , and keep my honour . and though such noble lady , as you ladyship and , who be bear to independency , and be hereditarily , as I may say , on a foot with the highest - descende gentleman in the land , might have exert a spirit , and would have a right to choose you own servants , and to distribute reward and punishment to the deserving and undeserve , at you own good pleasure ; yet what have I , a poor girl , who owed even my title to common notice , to the bounty of my late good lady , and have only a kind of imputed sightliness of person , though enough to make I the subject of vile attempt ; who , from a situation of terror and apprehension , be lift up to a hope , beyond my highest ambition , and be bid to pardon the bad woman , as a instance , that I could forgive he own hard usage of I ; who have experience so often the violence and impetuosity of he temper , which even he belove mother never venture to oppose till it begin to subside , and then , indeed , he be all goodness and acknowledgment ; of which I could give you ladyship more than one instance . what , I say , have I to do , to take upon I lady - air , and to resent ? but , my dear lady ( let I , in this instance , bespeak the attention of you both ) , I should be inexcusable , if I do not tell you all the truth ; and that be , that I not only forgave the poor wretch , in regard to t_his command , but from _my own inclination also . if I be wrong in say this , I must submit it to you ladyship ; and , as I pretend not to perfection , be ready to take the blame I deserve in you ladyship 's judgment : but indeed , be it to be again , I verily think , I could not help forgive she .-- and be I not able to say this , I should be think to have make a mean court to my master 's passion , and to have do a wrong thing with my eye open : which I humbly conceive , no one should do . when full power be give I over this poor creature ( seemingly at least , though it might possibly have be resume , and I might have be re-commit to hers , have I give he reason to think i make a arrogant use of it ) , you can not imagine what a triumph I have in my mind over the mortified guilt , which ( from the highest degree of insolence and imperiousness , that before have harden she masculine feature ) appear in she countenance , when she find the table likely to be soon turn upon she . this change of behaviour , which at first discover itself in a sullen awe , and afterwards in a kind of silent respect , shew I , what a influence power have over she : and that when she could treat she late prisoner , when take into favour , so obsequiously , it be the less wonder the bad woman could think it she duty to obey command so unjust , when she obedience to they be require from she master . to be sure , if a look could have kill she , after some of she bad treatment , she have be slain over and over , as I may say : but to I , who be always teach to distinguish between the person and the action , I could not hold my resentment against the poor passive machine of mischief one day together , though she action be so odious to I . I should indeed except that time of my grand trial when she appear so much a wretch to I , that I see she not ( even after two day that she be keep from I ) without great flutter and emotion of heart : and I have represent to you brother before , how hard a condition it be for I to forgive so much unwomanly wickedness . but , my dear lady , when I consider the latter in _one_ particular light , I could the more easily forgive she ; and _have forgive she , _bear she in my sight , and act by she ( as a consequence of that forgiveness ) as if she have not so horridly offen . else how would it have be forgiveness ? especially as she be asham of she crime , and there be no fear of she repeat it . thus then I think on the occasion : " poor wretch agent , for purpose little less than infernal ! I _will forgive thee , since _thy master and _my_ master will have it so . and indeed thou be beneath the resentment even of such a poor girl as I . I
I will _pity_ thee , base and abject as thout art . and she who be the object of my _pity be surely beneath my _anger _. " such be than my thought , my proud thought , so far be I from be guilty of _intentional_ meanness in forgive , at . interposition , the poor , low , creeping , abject _self_-mortified , and _master_ - mortify , . and do you think , lady , when you revolve in you thought , _who_ I be , and _what I be , and what I have be _design for ; when you revolve the amazing turn in my favour , and the prospects before I ( so much above my hope , that I leave they entirely to to direct for I , as it please , without da to look forward to what those prospect seem naturally to tend ) ; when I could see my haughty persecutor become my repentant protector ; the lofy spirit that use to make I tremble , and to which I never could look up without awe , except in those animating case , where he guilty attempt , and the concern I have to preserve my innocence , give a courage more than natural to my otherwise dastardly heart : when this impetuous spirit could stoop to request one whom he have sink beneath even she usual low character of he servant , who be he prisoner , under sentence of a ruin worse than death , as he have intend it , and have seize she for that very purpose , could stoop to acknowledge the vileness of that purpose ; could say , at one time , that my forgiveness of should stand I in greater stead than I be aware of : could tell she , before I , that she must for the future show I all the respect due to one he must love ; at another , acknowledge before she , that he have be stark natch , and that I be very forgive ; again , to , put himself on a level with she , as to guil , " we be both in generous hand : and , indeed , if do not pardon _you_, I should think she but half forgave _me_ , because you act by my instruction : " another time to the same , " we have be both sinner , and must be both include in one act of grace :" -- when I be thus lift up to the state of a sovereign forgiver , and my lordly master become a petitioner for himself , and the guilty creature , whom he put under my foot ; what a triumph be here for the poor ? and could I have be guilty of so mean a pride , as to trample upon the poor abject creature , when I find she thus lowly , thus mortified , and wholly in my power ? then , my dear lady , while I be enjoy the soul - charme fruit of that innocence which the have enable I to preserve , in spite of so many plot and contrivance on my master 's side , and such wicked instigation and assistances on hers , and all my prospect be improve upon I beyond my wish ; when all be unclouded sunshine , and I possess my mind in peace , and have only to be thankful to , which have be so gracious to my unworthiness ; when I see my persecutor become my protector , my active enemy no longer my enemy , but creepe with slow , doubtful foot , and speak to I with awful hesitat doubt of my acceptance ; a stamp of a insolent foot now turn into curtsey half - bent knee ; threaten hand into supplicat fold ; and the eye unpity to innocence , run over with the sense of she own guilt ; a falter accent on she late menacing tongue , and uplift handkerchief , " I see she will be my lady : and then I know how it will go with I ! " -- be not this , my lady , a triumph of triumph to the late miserable , now exalt , !-- could I do less than pardon she ? and have declare that I do so , be I not to show the sincerity of my declaration ? would it not have shew my master , that the low - bear be incapable of a generous action , have she refuse the only request she humble condition have give she the opportunity of granting , at that time , with innocence ? would he not have think the humble cottager as capable of insolence , and vengeance too , in she turn , as the better bear ? and that she want but the power , to show the like unrelenting temper , by which she have so grievously suffer ? and might not this have give he room to think I ( and to have resume and prosecute he purpose accordingly ) fitter for a arrogant keep mistress , than a humble and oblige wife ! " I see " ( might he not have say ? ) , " the girl have strong passion and resentment ; and she that have , will be sometimes _govern by they . I will improve upon the hint she herself have now give I , by she inexorable temper : I will gratify she revenge , till I turn it upon herself : I will indulge she pride , till I make it administer to she fall ; for a wife I can not think of in the low - bear cottager , especially when she have lurk in she all the pride and arrogance " ( you know , my lady ,
, he haughty way of speak of we sex ) " of the better descende . and by a little perseverance , and watch she unguarded hour , and apply temptation to she passion , I shall first discover they , and then make my advantage of they . " might not this have be the language , and this the resolution , of such a dear wicked intriguer ? -- for , my lady , you can hardly conceive the struggle he apparently have to bring down he high spirit to so humble a level . and though , I hope , all would have be , even in this _worst_ case , ineffectual , through , yet how do I know what lurking vileness might have appear by degree in this frail heart , to encourage he design , and to augment my trials and my dangers ? and perhaps downright violence might have be use , if he could not , on one hand , have subdue he passion , nor , on the other , have overcome he pride -- a pride , that every one , reflect upon the disparity of birth and condition between we , would have dignify with the name of _decency ; a pride that be become such a essential part of the dear gentleman 's character , in this instance of a wife , that although he know he could not keep it up , if he make _me_ happy , yet it be no small motive of he choose I , in one respect , because he expect from I more humility , more submission , than he think would be pay he by a lady equally bear and educate ; and of this I will send you a instance , in a transcription from that part of my journal you have not see , of he lesson to I , on my incurr he displeasure by interposing between yourself and he in you misunderstanding at the hall : for , , I intend to send , at time , any thing I think worthy of you ladyship 's attention , out of those papers you be so kind as to excuse I from send you in a lump , and many of which must need have appear very impertinent to such judge . thus ( could you ladyship have think it ? ) have I venture upon a strange paradox , that even this strongest instance of he debasing himself , be not the weakest of he pride : and he venture once at 's to say , in you hearing , as you may remember , that , in he conscience , he think he should hardly have make a tolerable husband to any body but : and why ? for the reason you will see in the inclose papers , which give a account of the noblest and earliest curtain - lecture that ever girl have : one of which be , that he expect to be _borne_ with ( _complied_ with , he mean ) even when in the wrong : another , that a wife should never so much as expostulate with he , though he be in the wrong , till , by comply with all he insist upon , she should have shew he , she design rather to convince he , for he _own_ sake , than for _contradiction 's sake ; and then , another time , perhaps he might take better resolution . I hope , from what I have say , it will appear to you lady - ship , and to too , that I be justifi , or at least excuse , in pardoning . but you dear brother have just send I word , that supper wait for I : and the post be ready to go off , I defer till the next opportunity which I have to say as to these good effect : and be , in the mean time , _you ladyship 's most obliged and faithful servant , my , I will now acquaint you with the good effect my behaviour to have have upon she , as a farther justification of my conduct towards the poor woman . that she begin to be affect as I wish , appear to I before I leave the hall , not only in the conversation I have with she after my happiness be complete ; but in she general demeanour also to the servants , to the neighbour , and in she devout behaviour at church : and this still further appear by a letter I have receive from . I dare say you ladyship will be pleased with the perusal of the whole letter , although a part of it would answer my present design ; and in confidence , that you will excuse , for the sake of its other beautie , the high and undeserved praise which she so lavishly bestow upon I , I will transcribe it all . from to b._ " my , " I must depend upon you known goodness to excuse I for not write before now , in answer to you letter of compliment to we , for the civility and favour , as you call they , which you receive from we in , where we be infinitely more obliged to you than you to we . " the truth be , my papa have be much disorder with a kind of rambling rheumatism , to which the physician , learnedly speak , give the name of _arthritici vaga_ , or the fly gout ; and when he ail ever so little ( it signify nothing conceal he infirmity , where they be so well know , and when he care not who know they ) , he be so peevish , and want so much attendance , that my mamma , and
and she two girl ( one of which be as waspish as she papa ; you may be sure I do not mean myself ) have much ado to make he worship keep the peace ; and I be he favourite , when he be indispose , have most patience , if I may give myself a good word , he call upon I continually , to read to he when he be grave , which be not often , and to tell he story , and s to he when he be merry ; and so I have be employ as a principal person about he , till I have frequently become sad to make he cheerful , and happy when I could do it at any rate . for once , in a pet , he fling a book at my head , because I have not attend he for two hour , and he could not bear to be slighte by little bastard , that be he word , that be fathere upon he for he vexation ! of these man ! father or husband , much alike ! the one tyrannical , the other insolent : so that , between one and t'other , a poor girl have nothing for it , but a few week ' courtship , and perhaps a first month 's bridalry , if that : and then she be as much a slave to she husband , as she be a vassal to she father -- I mean if the father be a , and the spouse a . " but I will be a little more grave ; for a graver occasion call for it , yet such as will give you real pleasure . it be the very great change that you example have have upon you housekeeper . " you desire she to keep up as much regularity as she could among the servants there ; and she be next to exemplary in it , so that she have every one 's good word . she speak of she lady not only with respect , but reverence ; and call it a bless day for all the family , and particularly for herself , that you come into . she read prayer , or make one of the servants read they , every night ; and never miss be at church , morning and afternoon ; and be prepare herself , by 's advice and direction , for receive the sacrament ; which she earnestly long to receive , and say it will be the seal of she reformation . " give we this account of she , and say she be full of contrition for she past mis-spent life , and be often ask he , if such and such sins can be forgive ? and among they , name she vile behaviour to she angel lady , as she call you . " it seem she have write a letter to you , which pass 's revisal , before she have the courage to send it ; and pride herself that you have favour she with a answer to it , which , she say , when she be dead , will be find in a cover of black silk next she heart ; for any thing from you hand , she be sure , will contribute to make she keep she good purpose : and for that reason she place it there ; and when she have have any bad thought , or be guilty of any faulty word , or passionate expression , she recollect she lady 's letter , which recover she to a calm , and put she again into a better frame . " as she have write to you ' ttis possible I might have spare you the trouble of read this account of she ; but yet you will not be displease , that so free a liver and speaker should have some testimonial besides she own assurance , to vouch for the sincerity of she reformation . " what a happy lady be you , that persuasion dwell upon you tongue , and reformation follow you example ! " you ladyship will forgive I what may appear like vanity in this communication . be a charming young lady . I always admire she ; but she letter be the sweetest , kindest ! -- yet I be too much the subject of she encomium , and so will say no more ; but add here a copy of the poor woman 's letter to I ; and you ladyship will see what a ample correspondence you have open to yourself , if you go on to countenance it . " , " I have be long labour under two difficulty ; the desire I have to write to you , and the fear of be think presumptuous if I do . but I will depend on you goodness , so often try ; and put pen to paper , in that very closet , and on that desk , which once be so much use by yourself , when I be act a part that now cut I to the heart to think off . but you forgave I . madam , and shew I you have too much goodness to revoke you forgiveness ; and could I have silence the reproach of my heart , I should have have no cause to think I have offend . " but , oh I , how have you goodness to I , which once fill I with so much gladness , now , on reflection , make I sorrowful , and at time , miserable .-- to think I should act so barbarously as I do , by so much sweetness , and so much forgiveness . every place that I remember to have use you hardly in , how
how do it now fill I with sadness , and make I often smite my breast , and sit down with tear and groan , bemoan my vile action , and my hard heart !-- how many place be there in this melancholy fine house , that call one thing or other to my remembrance , that give I remorse ! but the pond , and the woodhouse , whence I drag you so mercilously , after I have drive you to despair almost , what thought do they bring to my remembrance ! then my wicked instigation .-- what a odious wretch be I ! " have he honour be as abandon as myself , what virtue have be destroy between _his_ order and _my too rigorous execution of they ; nay , stretch they to show my wicked zeal , to serve a master , whom , though I honoure , I should not ( as you more than once hint to I , but with no effect at all , so resolutely wick be my heart ) have so well obey in he unlawful command ! " he honou have make you amend , have do justice to you merit , and so aton for t_his fault . but as for _me_, it be out of my power ever to make reparation .-- all that be leave I , be , to let you ladyship see , that you pious example have make such a impression upon I , that I be miserable now in the reflection upon my past guilt . " _You have forgive I , and _god_ will , I hope ; for the creature can not be more merciful than the Creator ; that be all my hope ! --yet , sometimes , I dread that I be forgive here , at least not punish , in order to be punish the more hereafter ! -- what then will become of the unhappy wretch , that have thus live in a state of sin , and so qualified herself by a course of wickedness , as to be think a proper instrument for the worst of purpose ! " pray you ladyship , let not my honoure master see this letter . he will think I have the boldness to reflect upon he : when , know my heart , I only write to condemn myself , and my _unwomanly action , as you be pleased often most justly to call they . " but I might go on thus for ever accuse myself , not consider whom I be write to , and whose precious time I be take up . but what I chiefly write for is , to beg you ladyship 's prayer for I . for , oh ! madam , I fear I shall else be ever miserable ! we every week hear of the good you do , and the charity you extend to the body of the miserable . , I beseech you , good madam , to the unhappy , the mercy of you prayer , and tell I if you think I have not sinn beyond hope of pardon ; for there be a woe denounce against the presumptuous sinner . " you ladyship assure I , at you departure , on the confession of my remorse for my misdoing , and my promise of amendment , that you would take it for proof of my be in earnest , if I would endeaavor to keep up a regularity among the servants here ; if I would subdue they with kindness , as I have own myself subdue ; and if I would endeaavor to make every one think , that the best security they could give of do they duty to they master in he _absence , be by do it to , from whose all - see eye nothing can be hide . this , I remember , you ladyship tell I , be the best test of fidelity and duty , that any servants could show ; since it be impossible , without religion , but that worldly convenience , or self - interest , must be the main tie ; and so the worst action might succeed , if servants think they should find they sordid advantage in sacrifice they duty . " so well be I convince of this truth , that I hope I have begin the example to good effect : and as no one in the family be so wicked as I , it be therefore less difficult to reform they ; and you will have the pleasure to know , that you have now servants here , whom you need not be asham to call yours . " t'Tis true , I find it a little difficult at first to keep they within sight of they duty , after you ladyship depart : but when they see I be in earnest , and use they courteously , as you advise , and as you usage of I convince I be the rightest usage ; when they be tell I have you command to acquaint you how they conform to you injunction ; the task become easy : and I hope we shall all be still more and more worthy of the favour of so good a lady and so bountiful a master . " I dare not presume upon the honour of a line to you unworthy servant . yet it would pride I much , if I could have it . but I shall ever pray for you ladyship' and he honour 's felicity , as become _you undeserving servant , " . . " I have already , with these transcribe letter of and , write a great deal : but nevertheless , as there yet remain one passage in you ladyship 's letter , relate to , that seem to require a answer
answer , I will take notice of it , if I shall not quite tire you patience . that passage be this ; rightly observe , say you ladyship , that he know what a vile woman she [ ] be , when he put you into she power ; and no doubt , employ she , because he be sure she would answer all he purpose : and therefore she should have have very little opinion of the sincerity of he reformation , while he be so solicitous in keep she there . she would , she say , have she be in you case , have have one struggle for she dismission , let it have be take as it would ; and he that be so well pleased with you virtue , must have think this a natural consequence of it , if in earnest to become virtuous himself . but , alas ! madam , he be not so well please with my virtue for virtue 's sake , as think he be .-- he would have be glad , even then , to have find I less resolve on that score . he do not so much as _pretend to any disposition to virtue . no , not he ! he have entertain , as it prove , a strong passion for I , which have be heighten by my _resisting it . he pride , and he advantage both of person and fortune , would not let he brook control ; and when he could not have I upon he own term , turn he evil purpose to good one ; and he resolve to submit to mine , or rather to such as he find I would not yield to he without . but think , I be to blame to put upon a foot , in the present I make on my nuptial , with . but I rather put on a foot with ; for the dear gentleman have _named_ the sum for I to give , and I would not give _less , because I love she better ; nor _more_ could I give she , on that occasion , without make such a difference between two person equal in station , on a solemnity too where one be present and assist , the other not , as would have shewn such a partiality , as might have induce they master to conclude , I be not so sincere in my forgiveness , as he hope from I , and as I really be . but a stronger reason still be behind ; that I could , much more agreeably , both to and myself , show my love and gratitude to the dear good woman : and this I have take care to do , in the manner I will submit to you ladyship ; at the tribunal of whose judgment I be willing all my action , respecte you dear brother , shall be try . and I hope you will not have reason to think I a too profuse or lavish creature ; yet , if you have , pray , my dear lady , do not spare I ; for if you shall judge I profuse in one article , I will endeaavor to save it in another . but I will make what I have to say on this head the subject of a letter by itself : and am , mean time , _you ladyship 's most obliged and obedient servant , my , it be needful , in order to let you more intelligibly into the subject where I leave off in my last , for you ladyship to know that you generous brother have make I he almoner , as I be my late dear lady 's ; and order to pay I fifty pound quarterly , for purpose of which he require no account , though I have one always ready to produce . now , , as I know be far from be easy in she circumstance , think herself oblige to pay old debt for two extravagant child , who be both dead , and maintain in schooling and clothes three of they child , which always keep she bare , I say to she one day , as she and I sit together , at we needle ( for we be always run over old story , when alone ) --" my good , will you allow I to ask you after you own private affair , and if you be tolerably , easy in they ? " " you be very good , madam , " say she , " to concern yourself about my poor matters , so much as you thought be employ , and every moment of you time be take up , from the hour you rise , to the time of you rest . but I can with great pleasure attribute it to you bounty , and that of my honoured master , that I be easier and easier every day . " " but tell I , my dear , " say I , " how you matter _particularly stand . I love to mingle concern with my friend , and as I hide nothing from _you_, I hope you will treat I with equal freedom ; for I always love you , and always will ; and nothing but death shall divide we friendship . " she have tear of gratitude in she eye , and take off she spectacle , " I can not bear , " she say , " so much goodness !-- oh ! my lady ! " " oh ! my Pamela , say , " reply I . " how often must I chide you for call I any thing but you , when we be alone together ? " " my heart , "
" say she , " will burst with you goodness ! I can not bear it ! " " but you _must bear it , and bear still greater exercise to you grateful heart , I can tell you that . a pretty thing , truly ! here I , a poor helpless girl , raise from poverty and distress by the generosity of the best of man , only because I be young and sightly , shall put on lady - air to a gentlewoman bear , the wisdom of whose year , she faithful service , and good management , make she a much greater merit in this family , than I can pretend to have ! and shall I return , in the day of my power , insult and haughtiness for the kindness and benevolence I receive from she in that of my indigence !-- indeed , I will not forgive you , my dear , if I think you capable of look upon I in any other light than as you daughter ; for you have be a mother to I , when the absence of my own could not afford I the comfort and good counsel I receive every day from you . " then move my chair nearer , and take she hand , and wipe , with my handkerchief in my other , she reverend cheek , " come , my dear second mother , " say I , " call I you daughter , you : I have pass many sweet hour with you under that name ; and as I have but too seldom such a opportunity as this , open to I you worthy heart , and let I know , if I can not make my _second_ mother as easy and happy as we dear master have make my _first_. " she hang she head , and I wait till the discharge of she tear give time for utterance to she word ; provoke only she speech , by say , " you use to have three grand - child to provide for in clothes and schooling . they be all live , I hope ? " " yes , madam , they be live : and you last bounty ( twenty guinea be a great sum , and all at once ! ) make I very easy and very happy ! " " how easy and how happy , ? " " why , my dear lady , I pay five to one old creditor of my unhappy son ; five to a second ; and two and a half to two other , in proportion to they respective demand ; and with the other five I pay off all arrear of the poor child 's schooling and maintenance ; and all be satisfied and easy , and declare they will never do harsh thing by I , if they be pay no more . " " but tell I , , the whole you owe in the world ; and you and I will contrive , with justice to we best friend , to do all we can to make you quite easy ; for , at you time of life , I can not bear that you shall have any thing to disturb you , which I can remove , and so , my dear , let I know all . I know you debt ( dear , just , good woman , as you be ! ) like 's sins , be ever before you : so come , " put my hand in she pocket , " let I be a friendly pick - pocket ; let I take out you memorandum - book , and we will see how all matters stand , and what can be do . come , I see you be too much move ; you worthy heart be too much affect " ( pull out she book , which she always have about she ) ; " I will go to my closet , and return presently . " so I leave she , to recover she spirits , and retire with the good woman 's book to my closet . you dear brother step into the parlour just after I have go out , " where be you lady , ? " say he . and be tell , come up to I :-- " what ail the good woman below , my dear ? " say he : " I hope you and she have have no word ? " " no , indeed , , " answer I . " if we have , I be sure it would have be my fault : but I have pick she pocket of she memorandum - book , in order to look into she private affair , to see if I cannot , with justice to we common benefactor , make she as easy as you . , have make my other dear parent . " " a blessing , " say he , " upon my charmer 's benevolent heart !-- I will leave every thing to you discretion , my dear .-- do all the good you prudently can to you . " I clasp my bold arm about he , the start tear testify my gratitude .--" , " say I , " you affect I as much as I do ; and if any one but you have a right to ask , what ail you ? as you do , what ail ? I must say , I be hourly so much oppress by you goodness , that there be hardly any bearing one be own joy . " he salute I , and say , I be a dear obliging creature . " but , " say he , " I come to tell you , that after dinner we will
will take a turn , if you please , to 's : she have a family of friend for she guest , and beg I will prevail upon you to give she you company , and attend you myself , only to drink tea with she ; for I have tell she we be to have friend to sup with we . " " I will attend you , , " reply I , " most willingly ; although I doubt I be to be make a shew of . " " something like it , " say he , " for she have promise they this favour . " " I need not dress otherwise than I be ? " " no , " he be pleased to say , I be always what he wish I to be . so he leave I to my _good work ( those be he kind word ) and I run over 's account , and find a balance draw of all she matter in one leaf , and a thankful acknowledgment to , for she master 's last bounty , which have enable she to give satisfaction to other , and to do herself great pleasure , write underneath . the balance of all be thirty - five pound eleven shilling and odd pence ; and I go to my escritoir , and take out forty pound , and down I hast to my good , and I say to she , " here , my dear good friend , be you pocket - book ; but be thirty - five or thirty - six pound all you owe , or be bound for in the world ? " " it be , , " say she , " and enough too . it be a great sum ; but ' ti in four hand , and they be all in pretty good circumstance , and so convinced of my honesty , that they will never trouble I for it ; for I have reduce the debt every year something , since I have be in my master 's service . " " shall it ever be in any body 's _power , " say I , " to trouble you : I will tell you how we will order it . " so I sit down , and make she sit by I . " here , my dear , be forty pound . it be not so much to I now , as the two guinea be to you , that you would have give I at my go away from this house to my father 's , as I think . I will not _give it you neither , at least at _present , as you shall hear : indeed I will not make you so uneasy as that come to . but take this , and pay the thirty - five pound odd money to the utmost farthing ; and the remain four pound odd will be a little fund in advance towards the child 's schooling . and thus you shall repay it ; I always design , as we dear master add five guinea per annum to you salary , in acknowledgement of the pleasure he take in you service , when I be , to add five pound per annum to it from the time I become . . but from that time , for so many year to come , you shall receive no more than you do , till the whole forty pound be repay . so , my dear , you will not have any obligation to I , you know , but for the advance ; and that be a poor matter , not to be speak of : and I will have leave for it , for fear I should die . " have you ladyship see the dear good woman 's behaviour , on this occasion , you would never have forget it . she could not speak ; tears run down she cheek in plentiful current : she modest hand put gently from she my offer hand , she bosom heav' , and she sobb ' with the painful tumult that seem to struggle within she , and which , for some few moment , make she incapable of speak . at last , I rise , and put my arm round she neck , wip she eye , and kiss she cheek , she cry , " my excellent lady ! ' ttis too much ! I can not bear all this . " -- she then throw herself at my foot ; for I be not strong enough to hinder it ; and with uplifted hand -- " , " say she -- I knee by she , and clasp she hand in mine , both uplift together -- " , " say I , drown she voice with my louder voice , " bless we both together , for many happy year ! and bless and reward the dear gentleman , who have thus enable I to make _to widow 's heart to s for joy !_ " and thus , my lady , do I force upon the good woman 's acceptance the forty pound . permit I , Madam , to close this letter here , and to resume the subject in my next : till when I have the honour to be _you ladyship 's most obliged and faithful servant , my , I now resume my last subject where I leave off , that you ladyship may have the whole before you at one view . I go after dinner , with my dear benefactor , to 's ; and meet with fresh call upon I for humility , have the two natural effect of the praise and profess admiration of that lady 's guest , as well as my dear
dear . , and those of and , to guard myself against : and you good brother be pleased to entertain I in the chariot , go and come , with a account of the order he have give in relation to the house , which be actually take , and the furniture he should direct for it ; so that I have no opportunity to tell he what I have do in relation to . but after supper , retire from company to my closet , when he friend be go , he come up to I about we usual bedtime : he enquire kindly after my employment , which be try to read in the french Telemachus : for , my lady , I be learn , I will assure you ! and who , do you think , be my master ?-- why , the best I _could have in the world , you dearest brother , who be pleased to say , I be no dunce : how inexcusable should I be , if I be , with such a master , who teach I on he knee , and reward I with a kiss whenever I do well , and say , I have already nearly master the accent and pronunciation , which he tell I be a great difficulty get over . I request he to render for I into two or three place that be beyond my reach ; and when he have do it , he ask I , in , what I have do for . I say , " permit I , ( for I be not proficient enough to answer you in my new tongue ) , in , to say , I have make the good woman quite happy ; and if I have you approbation , I shall be as much so myself in this instance , as I be in all other . " " I dare answer for you prudence , my dear , " he be pleased to say : " but this be you favourite : let I know , when you have so bountiful a heart to strangers , what you do for you favourite ? " I then say , " permit my bold eye , , to watch yours , as I obey you ; and you know you must not look full upon I then ; for if you do , how shall I look at you again ; how see , as I proceed , whether you be displease ? for you will not chide I in word , so partial have you the goodness to be to all I do . " he put he arm round I , and look down now and then , as I desire ! for of ! madam , he be all condescension and goodness to he unworthy , yet grateful ! I tell he all I have write to you about the forty pound .-- " and now , dear , " say I , half hide my face on he shoulder , " you have hear what I have do , chide or beat you Pamela , if you please : it shall be all kind from you , and matter of future direction and caution . " he raise my head , and kiss I two or three time , say , " thus then I chide , I beat , my angel !-- and yet I have one fault to find with you , and let , if not in bed , come up to we , and hear what it be ; for I will _expose_ you , as you deserve before she . " -- my be in hearing , attend to know if I want she assistance to undress , I bay she call . and though I think from he kind look , and kind word , as well as tender behaviour , that I have not much to fear , yet I be impatient to know what my fault be , for which i be to be expose . the good woman come ; and as she enter with all that modesty which be so graceful in she , he move he chair further from I , and , with a set aspect , but not unpleasant , say , " step in , : you lady " ( for so , Madam , he will always call I to , and to the servants ) " have incur my censure , and I would not tell she in what , till I have you face to face . " she look surprised -- now on I , now on she dear master ; and I , not know what he would say , look a little attentive . " I be sorry -- I be very sorry for it , , " say she , curtsey low :--" but should be more sorry , if _i_ be the unhappy occasion . " " why , , I can not say but it be on you account that I must blame she . " this give we both confusion , but especially the good woman ; for still I hope much from he kind behaviour to I just before -- and she say , " indeed , , I could never deserve ---- " he interrupt she -- " my charge against you , , " say he , " be that of niggardliness , and no other ; for I will put you both out of you pain : you ought not to have find out the method of repayment . " the dear creature , " say he , to , " seldom do any thing that can be mende ; but , I think , when you good conduct deserve a annual acknowledgment from I , in addition to you
you salary , the lady should have shew herself no less pleased with you service than the gentleman . have it be for old acquaintance - sake , for sex -ake , she should not have give I cause to upbraid she on this head . but I will tell you , that you must look upon the forty pound you have , as the effect of just distinction on many account : and you salary from last quarter - day shall be advanced , as the dear niggard intend it some year hence ; and let I only add , that when my first begin to show a coldness to she , I shall then suspect she be begin to decline in that humble virtue , which be now peculiar to herself and make she the delight of all who converse with she . " he be thus pleased to say : thus , with the most graceful generosity , and a nobleness of mind _truly peculiar to himself , be he pleased to _act : and what could or I say to he ?-- why , indeed , nothing at all !-- we could only look upon one another , with we eye and we heart full of a gratitude that would not permit either of we to speak , but which express itself at last in a manner he be pleased to call more elegant than word -- with uplifted fold hand , and tear of joy . of my dear lady ! how many opportunity have the beneficent _rich to make _themself , as well as they _fellow - creature , happy ! all that I could think , or say , or act , be but my duty before ; what a sense of obligation then must I lie under to this most generous of man ! but here let I put a end to this tedious subject ; the principal part of which can have no excuse , if it may not serve as a proof of my cheerful compliance with you ladyship 's command , that I recite _every thing of concern to I , and with the same freedom as I use to do to my dear parent . I have do it , and at the same time offer what I have to plead in behalf of my conduct to the two housekeeper , which you expect from I ; and I shall therefore close this my humble defence , if I may so call it , with the assurance that I be , _my dearest lady , you oblige and faithful servant , from to in answer to the six last letter ._ " where she have it , I can not tell I but I think I never meet with the fellow of she in my life , at any age ; " be , as I remember , my brother 's word , speak of he in the early part of you papers . in truth , thou be a surprising creature ; and every letter we have from you , we have new subjects to admire you for .--" do you think , , " say I , when I have read to the end of the subject about , " I will not soon set out to hit this charming girl a box of the ear or two ? " --" for what , Lady Davers ? " say she . " for what ! " reply I .--" why , do not you see how many slap of the face the bold slut hit I ! _I'll_ lady - air she !

Daver . MY , I read with pleasure you command , in you last kind and oblige letter : and you may be sure of a ready obedience in every one of they , that be in my power . that which I can most easily do , I will first do ; and that be , to transcribe the answer I send to , and that to , the former of which , ( and a long one it be ) be as follow : " , " I begin now to be afraid I shall not have the pleasure and benefit I promise myself of pass a fortnight or three week at the , in you sweet conversation , and that of you worthy family , as well as those other in you agreeable neighbourhood , whom I must always remember with equal honour and delight . " the occasion will be principally , that we expect , very soon , and , who propose to tarry here a fortnight at least ; and after that , the advanced season will carry we to , where . have take a house for he winter residence , and in order to attend parliament : a service he say , which he have be more deficient in hitherto , than he can either answer to he constituent , or to he own conscience ; for though he be but one , yet if any good motion should be lose by one , every absent member , who be independent , have to reproach himself with the consequence of the loss of that good which might otherwise redound to the commonwealth . and besides , he say , such excuse as he could make , _every one_ might plead ; and then public affair might as well be leave to the administration , and no parliament be choose . " see you , my dear , from the humble cottager , what a public person you favourite friend be grow ! how easy be it for a bold mind to look forward , and , perhaps , forget what she be , now she imagine she have a stake in the country , take upon herself to be as important , as significant , as if , like my dear , she have be bear to it ! " well ; but may I not ask , whether , if the mountain can not come to , will not come to the mountain ? since 's visit be so uncertain as to its beginning and duration , and so great a favour as I be to look upon it , and really shall , it be she first visit to _me _:-- and since we must go and take possession of we residence , why can not Sir spare to we the dear lady whom he could use hardly , and whose attendance ( though he be indeed entitle to all she duty ) he do not , just in that instance , quite so much deserve ? " ' well , but after all , , ' would I say , if I have be in presence at he peevish hour , ' you be a fine gentleman , be you not ? to take such a method to show you good daughter , that because she do not come _soon enough to you , she come too soon ! and do ever papa before you put a _good book ( for such I doubt not it be , _because you be in affliction , though so little affect by its precept ) to such a _bad use_ ? as parent 's example be so prevalent , suppose you daughter have take it , and fling it at she sister ; at she waiting - maid ; and so it have go through the family ; would it not have be a excuse for every one to say , that the father , and head of the family have set the example ? " ' you almost wish , my dear miss tell I , that I would undertake _you_!-- this be very good of you . ,' I might ( would he patience have suffer I to run on thus ) have add ; ' but I hope , since you be so sensible that you want to be undertaken , ( and since this peevish rashness convince I that you _do ) that you will undertake _yourself ; that you will not , when you indisposition require the attendance and duty of you dear lady and daughter , make it more uncomfortable to they , by _add a difficulty of be pleased , and a impatience of spirit , to the concern they duty and affection make they have for you ; and , _at least , resolve never to take a book into you hand again , if you can not make a better use of
of it , than you do then . ' " but will say , I have _already undertaken_ he , be he to see this . yet my once beg I would give he a hint or two on this subject , which , she be pleased to say , would be better receive from I than from any body : and if it be a little too severe , it be but a just reprisal make by one whose ear , he know , he have cruelly woun more than once , twice , or thrice , besides , by what he call he _innocent double entendre , and who , if she have not resent it , when a opportunity offer , must have be believe , by he , to be neither more nor less than a hypocrite . there be for you , : and so here end all my malice ; for now I have speak my mind . " yet I hope you dear papa will not be so angry as to deny I , for this my freedom , the request I make to _him , to you _mamma_ , and to you _dear self , for you beloved company , for a month or two in , and at : and if you might be permit to winter with we at the latter , how happy should I be ! it will be half do the moment you desire it . love you too well to refuse you , if you be earnest in it . you honoured mamma be always indulgent to you request : and as well in kindness to I , as for the great respect he bear you , join with I to beg this favour of you , and of and my lady . " if it can be obtain , what pleasure and improvement may I not propose to myself , with so polite a companion , when we be carry by to the play , the opera , and other of the town diversion ! we will work , visit , read , and s together , and improve one another ; you _me_ , in every word you shall speak , in every thing you shall do ; I you _, by my question , and desire of information , which will make you open all you breast to I : and so unlocking that dear storehouse of virtuous knowledge , improve you own notion the more for communicate they . of my dear I how happy be it in you power to make I ! " I be much affect with you account of 's reformation , I could have wish , have I not _other and _stronger inducement ( in the pleasure of so agreeable a neighbourhood , and so sweet a companion ) , I could have be down at the , in hope to have confirm the poor woman in she newly assume penitence . give she to persevere in it !-- to be a humble means of save a soul from perdition ! of my dear , let I enjoy that heart - ravish hope !-- to pluck such a brand as this out of the fire , and to assist to quench its flaming susceptibility for mischief , and make it useful to edify purpose , what a pleasure do this afford one ! how do it encourage one to proceed in the way one have be guide to pursue ! how do it make I hope , that I be raise to my present condition , in order to be a humble instrument in the hand of Providence to communicate great good to other , and so extend to many those benefit I have receive , which , be they to go no further than myself , what a vile , what a ungrateful creature should I be ! " I see , my dearest , how useful in every condition of life a virtuous and a serious turn of mind may be ! " in hope of see you with we , I will not enlarge on several agreeable subject , which I could touch upon with pleasure , besides what I give you in my former ( of my reception here , and of the kindness of we genteel neighbour ) : such , particularly , as the arrival here of my dear parent , and the kind , generous entertainment they meet with from my best friend ; he condescension in not only permit I to attend they to , but accompany we thither , and settle they in a most happy manner , beyond they wish and my own ; but yet so much in character , as I may say , that every one must approve he judicious benevolence ; the favour of my good Lady Daver to I , who , pleased with my letter , have vouchsaf to become my correspondent ; and a thousand thing , which I want personally to communicate to my dear . " be pleased to present my humble respects to , and to ; to good Madam , and to you kind friend at ; also to and , and they kins-woman : and beg of that good gentleman from I to encourage he new proselyte all he can ; and I doubt not , she will do credit , poor woman ! to the pain he shall take with she . in hope of you kind compliance with my wish for you company , I remain , _dearest , you faithful and obliged friend and servant ,_ " P.B . " this , my good lady , be the long letter I send to , who , at parting , engage I to keep up a correspondence with she , and put I in hope of passing a month or two at the hall
hall , if we come down , and if she could persuade and she mamma to spare she to my wish . you ladyship will excuse I for so faintly mention the honour you confer upon I : but I would not either add or diminish in the communication I make to you . the follow be the copy of what I write to : " you give I , Jewkes , very great pleasure , to find , that , at length , have touch you heart , and let you see , while health and strength last , the error of you way . many a unhappy one have not be so graciously touche , till they have smart under some heavy affliction , or be confine to the bed of sickness , when , perhaps , they have make vow and resolution , that have hold they no longer than the discipline last ; but you give I much better hope of the sincerity of you conversion ; as you be so well convince , before some sore evil have overtake you : and it ought to be a earnest to you of the favour , and should keep you from despondency . " as to I , it become I to forgive you , as I must cordially do ; since you usage of I , as it prove , be but a necessary means in the hand of , to exal I to that state of happiness , in which I have every day more and more cause give I to rejoice , by the kindest and most generous of gentleman . " as I have often pray for you , even when you use I the most unkindly , I now praise for have hear my prayer , and with high delight look upon you as a reclaim soul give to my supplication . may the goodness enable you to persevere in the course you have begin ! and when you can taste the all - surpassing pleasure that fill the worthy breast , on be place in a station where you example may be of advantage to the soul of other , as well as to you own -- a pleasure that every good mind glory in , and none else can truly relish ; then may you be assure , that nothing but you perseverance , and the consequential improvement result from it , be want to convince you , that you be in a right way , and that the woe that be pronounce against the presumptuous sinner , belong not to you . " let I , therefore , dear ( for now _indeed you be dear to I ) , caution you against two thing ; the one , that you return not to you former way , and wilfully err after this repentance ; for the divine goodness will then look upon itself as mock by you , and will withdraw itself from you ; and more dreadful will you state then be , than if you have never repent : the other , that you do not despair of the mercy , which have so evidently manifest itself in you favour , and have awaken you out of you deplorable lethargy , without those sharp medicines and operation , which other , and perhaps not more faulty person , have suffer . but go on cheerfully in the same happy path . Depend upon it , you be now in the right way , and turn not either to the right hand or to the left ; for the reward be before you , in reputation and a good fame in this life , and everlast felicity beyond it . " you letter be that of a sensible woman , as I always think you ; and of a truly contrite one , as I hope you will prove yourself to be : and I the rather hope it , as I shall be always desirous , then of take every opportunity that offer of do you real service , as well with regard to you present as future life : for I be , _good_ , as I now hope I may call you , _you love friend to serve you , " whatever good book the worthy will be so kind as to recommend to you , and to those under you direction , send for they either to , , or , and place they to my account : and may they be the effectual means of confirm you and they in the good way you be in ! I have do as much for all here : and , I hope , to no bad effect : for I shall now tell they , by , if there be occasion , that I hope they will not let I be out - do in , by in ; but that the servants of both house may do credit to the best of master . , _good woman ; as once more I take pleasure to style you . " * * * * * thus , my good lady , have I obey you , in transcrib these two letter . I will now proceed to you ladyship 's twelve article . as to the 1 . I will oblige you ladyship , as I have opportunity , in my future letter , with such account of my dear lady 's favour and goodness to I , as I think will be acceptable to you , and to the noble lady you mention . 2 . I be extremely delighted , that you ladyship think so well of my dear honest parent : they be good people , and ever have mind that set they above low and sordid action : and and you good brother have reward they most amply in this world
world , which be more than they ever expect , after a series of unprosperousness in all they undertake . you ladyship be pleased to say , that people in upper life love to see how plain nature operate in honest mind , who have hardly any thing else for they guide : and if I might not be think to descmend too low for you ladyship 's attention ( for , as to myself , I shall , I hope , always look back with pleasure to what I _be , in order to increase my thankfulness for what I _am ) , I would give you a scene of resignation , and contente poverty , of which otherwise you can hardly have a notion . I _will_ give it , because it will be a scene of nature , however low , which you ladyship love , and it shall not tire you by its length . it be upon occasion of a great loss and disappointment which happen to my dear parent ; for though they be never high in life , yet they be not always so low as my honoured lady find they , when she take I . my poor father come home ; and as the loss be of such a nature , as that he could not keep it from my mother , he take she hand , and say , after he have acquaint she with it , " come , my dear , let we take comfort , that we do for the best . we leave the issue to , as we ink , and that have turn it as it please ; and we must be content , though not favour as we wish .-- all the business be , we lot be not cast for this life . let we resign ourselves to the divine will , and continue to do we duty , and this short life will soon be past . we trouble will be quickly overblown ; and we shall be happy in a better , I make no doubt . " then my dear mother throw she arm about he neck , and say , with tear , " 's will be do , my dear love ! all can not be rich and happy . I be contente , and have rather say , I have a poor honest husband , than a guilty rich one . what signify repin : let the world go as it will , we shall have we length and we breadth at last . and , I doubt not , will be a better friend to we good girl here , because she be good , than we could be , if this have not happen , " point to I , who , then about eleven year old ( for it be before my lady take I ) , sit weeping in the chimney corner , over a few dying ember of a fire , at they move expression . I arise , and kiss both they hand , and bless they , say , " and this length and breadth , my dear parent , will be , one day , all that the rich and the great can possess ; and , it may be , they ungracious heirs will trample upon they ash , and rejoice they be go : while such a poor girl as I , be honour the memory of mine , who , in they good name , and good lesson , will have leave I the best of portion . " and then they both hug I to they fond bosom , by turn ; and all three be fill with comfort in one another . for a farther proon that _honest poverty be not such a deplorable thing as some people imagine , let I ask , what pleasure can those over -happy person know , who , from the luxury of they taste , and they affluent circumstance , always eat before they be hungry , and drink before they be thirsty ? this may be illustrate by the instance of a certain eastern monarch , who , as I have read , march at the head of a vast army , through a wide extended desert , which afforde neither river nor spring , for the first time , find himself ( in common with he soldier ) overtake by a craving thirst , which make he pant after a cup of water . and when , after diligent search , one of he soldier find a little dirty puddle , and carry he some of the filthy water in he nasty helmet , the monarch greedily swallow it , cry out , that in all he life he never taste so sweet a dratch ! but when I talk or write of my worthy parent , how I run on !-- excuse I , my good lady , and do not think I , in this respect , too much like the cat in the fable , turn into a fine lady ; for though I would never forget what I be , yet I would be think to know _how gratefully to enjoy my present happiness , as well with regard to my obligation to , as to you dear brother . but let I proceed to you ladyship 's third particular . 3 . and you can not imagine . madam , how much you have set my heart at rest , when you say , that my dear . give I a just narrative of this affair with : for when you ladyship desire to know how he have recount that story , lest you should make a misunderstanding between we unaware , I know not what to think . I be afraid some blood have be she on the occasion
occasion by he : for the lady be ruin , and as to she , nothing could have happen worse . the regard I have for . future happiness , which , in my constant supplication for he in private , cost I many a tear , give I great apprehension , and not a little uneasiness . but as you ladyship tell I that he give I a just account , I be happy again . I now come to you ladyship 's fourth particular . and highly delighted I be for have obtain you approbation of my conduct to the child , as well as of my behaviour towards the dear gentleman , on the unhappy lady 's score . you ladyship 's wise intimation about have the child with I , make due impressions upon I ; and I see in they , with grateful pleasure , you unmerited regard for I . yet , I do not know how it be , but I have conceive a strange passion for this dear baby ; I can not but look upon she poor mamma as my sister in point of trial ; and shall not the prosperous sister pity and love the poor dear sister that , in so slippery a path , have _fallen , while _she have the happiness to keep she foot ? the rest of you ladyship 's article give I the greatest pleasure and satisfaction ; and if I can but continue myself in the favour of you dear brother , and improve in that of he noble sister , how happy shall I be ! I will do all I can to deserve both . and I hope you will take as a instance of it , my cheerful obedience to you command , in writing to so fine a judge , such crude and indigested stuff , as , otherwise I ought to be asham to lay before you . I be impatient for the honour of you presence here ; and yet I perplex myself with the fear of appear so unworthy in you eye when near you , as to suffer in you opinion ; but I promise myself , that however this may be the case on you first visit , I shall be so much improve by the benefit I shall reap from you lesson and good example , that whenever I shall be favour with a _second you shall have fewer fault to find with I ; till , as I shall be more and more favoured , I shall in time be just what you ladyship will wish I to be , and , of consequence , more worthy than I be of the honour of stiling myself _your ladyship 's most humble and obedient servant , , in answer to . , p_. 60 . my . , you be highly oblige in expressing so warmly you wish to have I with you . I know not any body in this world , out of we own family , in whose company I should be happier ; but my papa will not part with I , I think ; though I have secure my mamma in my interest ; and I know would be glad of my absence , because the dear , perversely envious , think _me_ more valued than _she_ be ; and yet , foolish girl , she do not consider , that if she envy be well grounde , I should return with more than double advantage to what I now have , improve by you charming conversation . my papa affect to be in a fearful pet , at you lecturing of he so justly ; for my mamma would show he the letter ; and he say he will positively demand satisfaction of for you treat he so freely . and yet he shall hardly think he , he say , on a rank with he , unless will , on occasion of the new commission , take out he Dedimus : and then if he will bring you down to , and join with he to commit you prisoner for a month at the hall , all shall be well . it be very obliging in to join in you kind invitation : but -- yet I be loth to say it to you -- the character of you worthy gentleman , I doubt , stand a little in the way with my papa . my mamma plead he be marry . " ads - dine , madam , " say he , " what of all that ! " " but , , " say I , " I hope , if I may not go to , you will permit I to go to , when go ? " " no , " say he , " positively no ! " " well , , I have do . I could hope , however , you would enable I to give a better reason to good Mr . b . why I be not permit to accept of the kind invitation , than that which I understand you have be pleased to assign . " he stike he hand in he side , with he usual humourous positiveness . " why , then tell she she be a very saucy lady , for she last letter to you , and she lord and master be not to be trust ; and it be my absolute will and pleasure that you ask I no more question about it . " " I will very faithfully make this report , . " -- " do so . " and so I have . and you poor be disappointed of one of the greatest pleasure she could have have . I can not help it -- if you truly pity I you can make I ease under the
the disappointment , than otherwise possible , by favour I with a epistolary conversation , since I be deny a personal one ; and my mamma join in the request ; particularly let we know how 's first visit pass ; which and , who know my lady so well , likewise long to hear . and this will make we the best amend in you power for the loss of you good neighbourhood , which we have all promise to ourselves . this denial of my papa come out , since I write the above , to be principally owe to a proposal make he of a humble servant to one of he daughter : he will not say which , he tell we , in he usual humourous way , lest we should fall out about it . " I suppose , " I tell he , " the young gentleman be to pick and choose which of the two he like best . " but be he a duke , ' tis all one to , if he be not something above we common Lincolnshire class of fox - hunter . I have shew and Peter you letter . they admire you beyond expression ; and say , he do not know , that ever he do any thing in he life , that give he so much inward reproach , as he deny you the protection of he family , which seek to move he to afford you , when you be confine at the hall , before come down to you , with he heart bend on mischief ; and all he comfort himself with be , that very denial , as well as the other hardship you have meet with , be necessary to bring about that work of Providence which be to reward you unexampled virtue . yet , he say , he doubt he shall not be think excusable by you , who be so exact in _your_ own duty , since he have the unhappiness to lose such a opportunity to have do honou to he function , have he have the fortitude to have do _he ;_ and he have begge of I to hind he concern to you on this head ; and to express he hope , that neither religion nor he cloth may suffer in you opinion , for the fault of one of its professor , who never be wante in he duty so much before . he have it often upon he mind , he say , to write to you on this very subject ; but he have not the courage ; and beside , do not know _how might take it , if he should see that letter , as the case have such delicate circumstance in it , that in blame himself , as he should very freely have do , he must , by implication , have cast still greater blame upon he . be certainly a very good man , and my favourite for that reason ; and I hope _you ,_ who could so easily forgive the late wicked , but now penitent Jewkes , will overlook with kindness a fault in a good man , which proceed more from pusillanimity and constitution , than from want of principle : for once , talk of it to my mamma , before I , he accuse himself on this score , to she , with tear in he eye . she , good lady , would have give you this protection at 's desire ; but want the power to do it . so you see , my dear , how you virtue have sham every one into such a sense of what they ink to have do , that good , bad , and indifferent , be seek to make excuse for past misbehaviour , and to promise future amendment , like penitent subject return to they duty to they conquering sovereign , after some unworthy defection . happy , happy lady ! may you ever be so ! may you always convert you enemy , invigorate the lukewarm , and every day multiply you friend , wish _you most affectionate ,_ POLLy Darnford . p.s. how I rejoice in the joy of you honest parent ! bless th'ey ! I be glad be so wise . every one I have name desire they best respects . write oftener , and omin not the minutest thing : for every line of yours carry instruction with it . from to . , do I think I should ever have occasion to make a formal complaint against a person very dear to you , and who I believe deserve to be so ; but do not let she be so proud and so vain of oblige and pleas you , as to make she not care how she affront every body else . the person be no other than the wife of you bosom , who have take such liberty with I as ought not to be take , and seek to turn my own child against I , and make a dutiful girl a rebel . if people will set up for virtue , and all that , let th'ey be uniformly virtuous , or I would not give a farthing for they pretence . here I have be plagu with gout , rheumatism , and nameless disorder , ever since you leave we , which have make I call for a little more attendance than ordinary ; and I have reason to think myself slighte , where a indulgent father can least bear to be so , that be , where he must love ; and that by young upstart , who be grow up to the enjoyment of those pleasure which have run away from I , fleeting rascal as they be ! before I be willing to part
part with they . and I ring and ring , and " 's ? " ( for I honour the slut with too much of my notice ) , " where 's Polly ? " be all my cry , to every one who come up to ask what I ring for . and , at last , in burst the pert baggage , with a air of assurance , as if she think all must be well the moment she appear , with " do you want I , papa ? " " do I want you , confidence ? yes , I do . where have you be these two hour , that you never come near I , when you know ' tbe my time to have my foot rub , which give I mortal pain ? " for you must understand , , that nobody 's hand be so soft as 's . she give I a saucy answer , as I be dispose to think it , because I have just then a twinge , that I could scarce bear ; for pain be a plaguy thing to a man of my lively spirit . she give I , I say , a careless answer , and turn upon she heel ; and not come to I at my first word , I fling a book which I have in my hand , at she head . and , this fine lady of you 's , this paragon of meekness and humility , in so many word , bid I , or , which be worse , tell my own daughter to bid I , never to take a book into my hand again , if I will not make a better use of it :-- and yet , what better use can a offended father make of the best book , than to correct a rebellious child with they , and oblige a saucy daughter to jump into she duty all at once ? reflect upon I for make she blush formerly , and say thing before my daughter , that , truly , I ought to be asham of ? then avow malice and revenge . why neighbour , be these thing to be borne ?-- do you allow you lady to set up for a general corrector of every body 's moral but you own ?-- do you allow she to condemn the only instance of wit that remain to this generation ; that dear polite _double entendre , which keep alive the attention , and quicken the apprehension , of the best company in the world , and be the salt , the sauce , which give a poignancy to all we genteeler entertainment ! very fine , truly ! that more than half the world shall be shut out of society , shall be preclude they share of conversation amongst the gay and polite of both sex , be you lady to have she will ! let she first find people who can support a conversation with wit and good sense like she own , and then something may be say : but till then , I positively say , and will swear upon occasion , that double entendre shall not be banish from we table ; and where this will not raise a blush , or create a laugh , we will , if we please , for all Mr . b . and she new - fangled notion , force the one and the other by still plainer hint ; and let she help herself how she can . thus , , you find my complaint be of a high nature , regard the quiet of a family , the duty of a child to a parent , and the freedom and politeness of conversation ; in all which you lady have greatly offend ; and I insist upon satisfaction from you , or such a correction of the fair transgressor , as be in you power to inflict , and which may prevent worse consequence from _you offended friend and servant , . from in to the preceding one ._ , you can not but believe that I be much surprised at you letter , complain of the behaviour of my wife . I could no more have expect such a complaint from such a gentleman , than I could , that she would have deserve it : and I be very sorry on _both account . I have talk to she in such a manner , that , I dare say , she will never give you like cause to appeal to I . it happen , that the criminal herself receive it from she servant , and bring it to I in my closet ; and , make she honour ( for I can not say but she be very obliging to I , though she take such saucy freedom with my friend ) away she tript ; and I , inquire for she , when , with surprise , as you may believe , I have read you charge , find she be gone to visit a poor sick neighbour ; of which indeed I know before because she take the chariot ; but I have forget it in my wrath . at last , in she come , with that sweet composure in she face which result from a consciousness of do _generally just and generous thing . I resume , therefore , that sternness and displeasure which she entrance have almost dissipated . I take she hand ; she charme eye ( you know what a eye she have , ) quiver at my overclouded aspect ; and she lip , half draw to a smile , trembl with apprehension of a countenance so change from what she leave it . and then , all stiff and stately as I could look ,
, do I accost she -- " come along with I , , to my closet . I want to talk with you . " " what have I do ? let I know , good Sir ! " look round , with she half - affright eye , this way and that , on the book , and picture , and on I , by turn . " you shall know soon , " say I , " the _crime_ you have be guilty of . " --" _Crime , ! pray let I -- this closet , I hope , would not be a _second time witness to the flutter you put I in . " there hang a tale , , which I be not very fond of relating , since it give begin to the triumph of this little sorceress . I still hold one hand , and she stand before I , as criminal ought to do before they judge , but say , " I see , , sure I do , -- or what will else become of I !-- less severity in you eye , than you affect to put on in you countenance . dear sir , let I but know my fault : I will repent , acknowledge , and amend . " " you must have great presence of mind , , such be the nature of you fault , if you can look I in the face , when I tell it you . " " then let I , " say the irresistible charmer , hide she face in my bosom , and put she other arm about my neck , " let I thus , my dear , hide this guilty face , while I hear my fault tell ; and I will not seek to extenuate it , by my tear , and my penitence . " I could hardly hold out . what infatuat creature be these woman , when they thus soothey and calm the tumult of a angry heart ! when , instead of _scornful_ look dart in return for _angry one , word of _defiance for word of _peevishness ,_ persist to defend _one_ error by _another , and return _vehement wrath for _slight indignation ,_ and all the hostile provocation of the marriage warfare ; they can thus hide they dear face in we bosom , and wish but to _know_ they fault , to _amend they ! I could hardly , I say , resist the sweet girl 's behaviour ; nay , I believe , I do , and in defiance to my resolved displeasure , press she forehead with my lip , as the rest of she face be hid on my breast ; but , consider it be the cause of my _friend ,_ I be to assert , my _injure friend , wounded and insult , in so various a manner by the fair offender , thus haughtily speak I to the trembling mischief , in a pomp of style theatrically tragic : " I will not , too inadvertent , and undistinguishing , keep you long in suspense , for the sake of a circumstance , that , on this occasion , ought to give you as much joy , as it have , till now , give I -- since it become a advocate in you favour , when otherwise you might expect very severe treatment . know then , that the letter you give I before you go out , be a letter from a friend , a neighbour , a worthy neighbour , complain of you behaviour to he ; -- no other than " ( for I would not amuse she too much ) , " a gentleman I must always respect , and whom , as my friend , I expect _you_ should : since , by the value a wife expressis for one esteem by she husband , whether she think so well of he herself , or not , a man ought always to judge of the sincerity of she regards to himself . " she raise she head at once on this :-- " , " say she , " it be no worse !-- I be at my wit 's end almost , in apprehension : but I know how this must be . dear sir , how could you frighten I so ?-- I know how all this be !-- I can now look you in the face , and hear all that can charge I with ! for I be sure , I have not so affront he as to make he angry indeed . and truly " ( run she on , secure of pardon as she seem to think ) , " I should respect not only as you friend , but on he own account , if he be not so sad a rake at a time of life -- " then I interrupt she , you must need think . ; for how could I bear to hear my worthy friend so freely treat ! " how now , ! " say I ; " and be it thus , by _repeating_ you fault , that you _ato for it ? do you think I can bear to hear my friend so freely treat ? " " indeed , " say she , " I do respect very much as you _friend , permit I to repeat ; but can not for he wilful failings . would it not be , in some measure , to approve of faulty conversation , if one can hear it , and not discourage it , when the occasion come in so pat ?-- and , indeed , I be glad of a opportunity , " continue she , " to give he a little rub ; I must need own it : but
but if it displease you , or have make he angry in earnest , I be sorry for it , and will be less bold for the future . " " read then , " say I , " the heavy charge , and I will return instantly to hear you answer to it . " so I go from she , for a few minute . but , would you believe it , ? she seem , on my return , very little concerned at you just complaint . what self - justify mind have the meekest of these woman !--Instead of find she in repentant tear , as one would expect , she take you angry letter for a jocular one ; and I have great difficulty to convince she of the heinousness of _her_ fault , or the reality of you resentment . upon which , be determined to have justice do to my friend , and a due sense of she own great error impress upon she , I begin thus : " Pamela , take heed that you do not suffer the purity of you own mind , in breach of you charity , to make you too rigorous a censurer of other people 's action : do not be so puffe up with you own perfection , as to imagine , that , because other person allow themselves libertie you can not take , _therefore_ they must be wick . be a gentleman who indulge himself in a pleasant vein , and , I believe , as well as you , _have be a great rake and libertine : " ( you will excuse I , , because I be take you part ) , " but what then ? you see it be all over with he now . he say , that he _must , and therefore he _will be virtuous : and be a man for ever to hear the fault of he youth , when so willing to forget they ? " " ah ! but , , , " say the bold slut , " can you say he be _will to forget they ? -- do he not repine in this very letter , that he _must forsake they ; and do he not plainly cherish the _inclination , when he own -- " she hesitate -- " what ? " --" you know what i mean . , and I need not speak it : and can there well be a more censurable character ?-- then before he maie daughter ! he virtuous lady ! _before_ any body !-- what a sad thing be this , at a time of life , which should afford a better example ! " but , dear , " continue the bold prattler , ( take advantage of a silence more owing to displeasure than approbation ) " let I , for I would not be too _censorious " ( no , not she ! in the very act of censoriousness to say this ! ) , " let I offer but one thing : do not you think himself would be loth to be think a reform gentleman ? do not you see he delight , when speak of he former prank , as if sorry he could not play they over again ? see but how he simper , and _enjoys , as one may say , the relation of he own rakish action , when he tell a bad story ! " " but , " say I , " be this the case " ( for I profess , , I be at a grievous loss to defend you ) , " for you to write all these free thing against a father to he daughter , be that right , ? " " o , ! the good gentleman himself have take care , that such a character as I presume to draw to of she papa , be no strange one to she . you have see yourself , , whenever he arch leer , and he humourous attitude on those occasion , have teach we to expect some shock story , how he lady and daughter ( use to he as they be ) , have suffer in they apprehension of what he would say , before he speak it : how , particularly , dear have look at I with concern , desirous , as it be , if possible , to save she papa from the censure , which he faulty expression must naturally bring upon he . and , dear , be it not a sad thing for a young lady , who love and honour she papa , to observe , that he be discredite himself , and _want the example he ought to _give ?_ and pardon I , Sir , for smile on so serious a occasion ; but be it not a fine sight to see a gentleman , as we have often see , when he have think proper to read a passage in some bad book , pull off t_his spectacle , to talk filthily upon it ? Methink I see he now , " add the bold slut , " split he arch face with a broad laugh , shew a mouth , with hardly a tooth in it , and make obscene remark upon what he have read . " and then the dear saucy - face laugh out , to bear _me_ company ; for I could not , for the soul of I , avoid laugh heartily at the figure she bring to my mind , which I have see my old friend more than once make , with he dismount spectacle , arch mouth , and gum of shining jet , succeed those of polished ivory , of which he often boast , as one ornament of he youthful day .
. -- and I the rather in my heart , , give you up , because , when I be a sad fellow , it be always my maxim to endeaavor to touch a lady 's heart without wounde she ear . and , indeed , I find my account sometimes in observe it . but , resume my gravity --" , say I , do you think I will have my old friend thus make the object of you ridicule ?--Suppose a challenge should have ensue between we on you account -- what might have be the issue of it ? to see a old gentleman , stumping , as he say , on crutch , to fight a duel in defence of he wounded honour ! " --" very bad , , to be sure : I see that , and be sorry for it : for have you carry off 's crutch , as a trophy , he must have lain sighing and groan like a wounded soldier in the field of battle , till another have be bring he , to have stump home with . " but , dear , I have bring this matter to a issue , that will , I hope , make all easy ;-- , and my , shall both be punish as they deserve , if it be not you own fault . I be tell , that the sins of you youth do not sit so heavily upon you limb , as in you imagination ; and I believe change of air , and the gratification of you revenge , a fine help to such lively spirit as yours , will set you up . you shall then take coach , and bring you pretty criminal to mine ; and when we have they together , they shall humble themselves before we , and you can absolve or punish they , as you shall see proper . for I can not bear to have my worthy friend insult in so heinous a manner , by a couple of saucy girl , who , if not take down in time , may proceed from fault to fault , till there will be no live with they . if ( to be still more serious ) you lady and you will lend to my 's wish , whose heart be set upon the hope of she winter with we in town , you will lay a obligation upon we both ; which will be acknowledge with great gratitude by , dear Sir , _you affectionate and humble servant . from in reply ._ , .-- a word in you ear :-- to be plain : I like neither you nor you wife well enough to trust my with you . but here 's war declare against my poor gum , it seem . well , I will never open my mouth before you lady as long as I live , if I can help it . I have for these ten year avoid to put on my cravat ; and for what reason , do you think ?-- why , because I could not bear to see what ruin a few year have make in a visage , that use to inspire love and terror as it please . and here you -- what - shall - I -call - she of a wife , with all the insolence of youth and beauty on she side , follow I with a glass , and would make I look in it , whether I will or not . I be a plaguy good - humour old fellow -- if I be a old fellow -- or I should not bear the insult contain in you letter . between you and you lady , you make a wretch figure of I , that be certain .-- and yet ' tis _tak my part _. but what must I do ?--I would be glad at any rate to stand in you lady 's graces , that I would ; nor would I be the last rake libertine unreform by she example , which I suppose will make virtue the fashion , if she go on as she do . but here I have be use to cut a joke and toss the squib about ; and , as far as I know , it have help to keep I alive in the midst of pain and ach , and with two woman - grow girl , and the rest of the mortification that will attend on _advanced year ; for I will not ( hang I if I will ) give it up as absolute _old age !_ but now , it seem , I must leave all this off , or I must be mortify with a look glass hold before I , and every wrinkle must be make as conspicuous as a furrow -- and what , pray , be to succeed to this reformation ?-- I can neither fast nor pray , I doubt . -- and beside , if my stomach and my jest depart from I , farewell , ! but can not I pass as one necessary character , do you think : as a foil ( as , by - the - bye , some of you own action have be to you lady 's virtue ) to set off some more edifying example , where variety of character make up a feast in conversation ? well , I believe I might have trust you with my daughter , under you lady 's eye , rake as you have be yourself ; and fame say wrong , if you have not be , for you time a bolder sinner than ever I be , with you maxim of touching lady ' heart , without wounde they ear , which make surer work with they , that be
be all ; though ' tis to be hope you be now reform ; and if you be , the whole country round you , east , west , north , and south , owe great obligation to you fair reclaimer . but here be a fine prim young fellow , come out of , with one estate in one county , another in another , and jointure and settlement in he hand , and more wit in he head , as well as more money in he pocket , than he can tell what to do with , to visit we Polly ; though I tell she I much question the former quality , he wit , if he be for marrying . here then be the reason I can not comply with you kind . . 's request . but if this matter should go off ; if he should not like _her , or she _him ; or if I should not like _his_ term , or he _mine _; -- or still another _or_, if he should like Nancy better why , then perhaps , if Polly be a good girl , I may trust to she virtue , and to you honour , and let she go for a month or two . now , when I have say this , and when I say , further , that I can forgive you severe lady , and yourself too , ( who , however , be less to be excuse in the air you assume , which look like one chimney - sweeper call another a sooty rascal ) I give a proof of my charity , which I hope with . . will cover a multitude of fault ; and the rather , since , though I can not be a _follower of she virtue in the strictest sense , I can be a _admirer_ of it ; and that be some little merit : and indeed all that can be at present pleade by _yourself , I doubt , any more than _you humble servant , . my Honoured and , I hope you will excuse my long silence , which have be owe to several cause , and have have nothing new to entertain you with : and yet this last be but a poor excuse to you , who think every trifling subject agreeable from you daughter . I daily expect here my and . this give I no small pleasure , and yet it be mingl with some uneasiness at time ; lest I should not , when view so intimately near , behave myself answerably to she ladyship 's expectation . but I resolve not to endeaavor to move out of the sphere of my own capacity , in order to emulate she ladyship . she must have advantage , by conversation , as well as education , which it would be arrogance in I to assume , or to think of imitating . all that I will attempt to do , therefore , shall be , to show such a respectful obligingness to my lady , as shall be consistent with the condition to which I be raise ; so that she may not have reason to reproach I of pride in my exaltation , nor she dear brother to rebuke I for meanness in condescending : and , as to my family arrangement , I be the less afraid of inspection , because , by the natural bia of my own mind , I bless , I be above dark reserve , and have not one selfish or sordid view , to make I wish to avoid the most scrutinising eye . I have begin a correspondence with , a young lady of uncommon merit . but yet you know she character from my former writings . she be very solicitous to hear of all that concern I , and particularly how Lady Davers and I agree together . I love she from the moment I see she first ; for she have the least pride , and the most benevolence and solid thought , I ever know in a young lady , and do not envy any one . I shall write to she often : and as I shall have so many avocation besides to fill up my time , I know you will excuse I , if I procure from this lady the return of my letter to she , for you perusal , and for the entertainment of you leisure hour . this will give you , from time to time , the account you desire of all that happen here . but as to what relate to we own particular , I beg you will never spare writing , as I shall not answer ; for it be one of my greatest delight , that I have such worthy parent ( as I hope in , I long shall ) to bless I and to correspond with I . the papers I send herewith will afford you some diversion , particularly those relate to ; and I must desire , that when you have peruse they ( as well as what I shall send for the future ) , you will return they to I . greatly please I , on he last return , in he account of you health , and the satisfaction you take in you happy lot ; and I must recite to you a brief conversation on this occasion , which , I dare say , will please you as much as it do I . after have adjust some affair with he dear principal , which take up two hour , my best beloved send for I . " my dear , " say he , seat I by he , and make the good old gentleman sit down , ( for he will always rise at
at my approach ) " and I have settle , in two hour , some account , which would have take up as many month with some persons : for never be there a exacter or more methodical accomptant . he give I ( greatly to my satisfaction , because I know it will delight you ) a account of the concern , and of the pleasure you father and mother take in it .-- now , my charmer , " say he , " I see you eye begin to glisten : of how this subject raise you whole soul to the window of it !-- never be so dutiful a daughter , ; and never do parent better deserve a daughter 's duty . " I endeavoure before to rein in a gratitude , that my throbb heart confess through my handkerchief , as I perceive : but the good old gentleman could not hinder he from shewing itself at he worthy eye , to see how much I be favour --_oppressed_, I should say -- with the tenderest goodness to I , and kind expression .--" excuse I , " say he , wip he cheek : " my delight to see such merit so justly reward will not be contain , I think . " and so he arise and walk to the window . " well , good , " say I , as he return towards we , " you give I the pleasure to know that my father and mother be well ; and happy then they _must be , in a goodness and bounty , that I , and many more , rejoice in . " " well and happy , madam ; -- ay , that they be , indeed ! a worthier couple never liv . most nobly do they go on in the farm . you honour be one of the happiest gentleman in the world . all the good you do , return upon you in a trice . it may well be say you cast you bread upon the water ; for it presently come to you again , richer and heavier than when you throw it in . all the tenant , madam , be hugely delighted with they good steward : every thing prosper under he management : the gentry love both he and my dame ; and the poor people adore they . " thus run on , to my inexpressible delight , you may believe ; and when he withdraw --" 'Tis a honest soul , " say my dear . " I love he for he respectful love to my angel , and he value for the worthy pair . very glad I be , that every thing answer _their_ wish . may they long live , and be happy ! " the dear man make I spring to he arm , whenever be touch this str : for he speak always thus kindly of you ; and be glad to hear , he say , that you do not live only to yourselves ; and now and then add , that he be as much satisfied with you prudence , as he be with mine ; that parent and daughter do credit to one another : and that the praise he hear of you from every mouth , make he take as great pleasure in you , as if you be he own relation . how delighte , how transport rather , my dear parent , must this goodness be to you happy daughter ! and how could I forbear repeat these kind thing to you , that you may see how well every thing be take that you do ? when the expect visit from and be over , the approaching winter will call we to ; and as I shall then be nearer to you , we may oftener hear from one another , which will be a great heightening to my pleasure . but I hear such a account of the immorality which person may observe there , along with the public diversion , that it take off a little from the satisfaction I should otherwise have in the thought of go thither . for , they say , quarrel , and duel , and gallantry , as they be call , so often happen in , that those enormity be hear of without the least wonder or surprise . this make I very thoughtful at time . but , I hope , will preserve we dearest benefactor , and continue to I he affection , and then I shall be always happy ; especially while you healt and felicity confirm and cry the delight of _your ever dutiful daughter ,_ P.B. letter Xxvi my Dearest child , it may not be improper to mention ourselves , what the nature of the kindness be , which we confer on we poor neighbour , and the labouring people , lest it should be surmise , by any body , that we be lavish away wealth that be not we own . not that we fear either you honoured husband or you will suspect so , or that the worthy would insinuate as much ; for he see what we do , and be highly pleased with it , and say he would make such a report of it as you write he do . what we do be in small thing , though the good we hope from they be not small perhaps : and if a very distressful case should happen among we poor neighbour , require any thing considerable , and the objects be deserve , we would acquaint you with it , and leave it to you to do as should direct you . my dear child , you be very happy , and if it _can_ be , may you be happier still ! yet I
I verily think you can not be more happy than you father and mother , except in this one thing , that all we happiness , under , proceed from you ; and , as other parent bless they child with plenty and benefit , you have bless you parent ( or you honoure husband rather for you sake ) with all the good thing this world can afford . you papers be the joy of we leisure hour ; and you be kind beyond all expression , in take care to oblige we with they . we know how you time be take up , and ought to be very well contente , if but now and then you let we hear of you health and welfare . but it be not enough with such a good daughter , that you have make we life _comfortable , but you will make they _joyful too , by communicate to we , all that befal you : and then you write so piously , and with such a sense of 's goodness to you , and intermix such good reflection in you writings , that whether it be we partial love or not , I can not tell , but , truly , we think nobody come up to you : and you make we heart and eye so often overflow , as we read , that we join hand in hand , and say to each other , in the same breath -- " bless be , and bless be you , my love , " -- " for such a daughter , " say the one -- " for such a daughter , " say the other -- " and she have you own sweet temper , " cry I .--" and she have you own honest heart , " cry she : and so we go on , bless , and you , and bless you spouse , and ourselves ! -- be any happiness like ours , my dear daughter ? we be really so enrapture with you writings , that when we spirit flag , through the infirmity of year , which hath begin to take hold of we , we have recourse to some of you papers :-- " come , my dear , " cry I , " what say you to a banquet now ? " -- she know what I mean . " with all my heart , " say she . so I read although it be on a , so good be you letter ; and you must know , I have copy of many , and after a little while we be as much alive and brisk , as if we have no nagging at all , and return to the duty of the day with double delight . consider then , my dear child , what joy you writing give we : and yet we be afraid of oppress you , who have so much to do of other kind ; and we be heartily glad you have find out a way to save trouble to yourself , and rejoice we , and oblige so worthy a young lady as , all at one time . I never shall forget she dear goodness , and notice of I at the hall , kindly press my rough hand with she fine hand , and look in my face with _so_ much kindness in she eye ! -- what good people , as well as bad , there be in high stations !-- thank God there be ; else we poor child would have have a sad time of it too often , when she be obliged to _step out of herself , as once I hear you phrase it , into company you could not _live with _. well , but what shall I say more ? and yet how shall I end ?-- only , with my prayer , that will continue to you the bless and comfort you be in possession of ! -- and pray now , be not over-thoughtful about ; for why should you let the dread of future evils lessen you present joy ?-- there be no absolute perfection in this life , that be true ; but one would make one 's self as easy as one could . ' tTis time enough to be troublead when trouble come --" _Sufficient unto the day be the evil thereof _. " , then , as you have often say you would , in you present blessing , and leave the event of thing to the of all event . and what have _you_ to do but to rejoice ? you _, who can not see a sun rise , but it be to bless you , and to raise up from they bed number to join in the blessing ! _You_ who can bless you high - born friend , and you low - born parent , and obscure relation ! the rich by you example , and the poor by you bounty ; and bless besides so good and so brave a husband ;-- of my dear child , what , let I repeat it , have _you_ to do but rejoice ?--_for many daughter have do wisely , but you have excel they all . I will only add , that every thing the ' squire order be just upon the point of be finish . and when the good time come , that we shall be again favoured with he presence and yours , what a still greater joy will this afford to the already overflowe heart of _you ever love father and mother , _and_ . Andrew . my , the interest I take in everything that concern you , make I very importunate to know how you approve the gentleman , whom some of you best friend and well
well - wisher have recommend to you favour . I hope he will deserve you good opinion , and then he must excel most of the unmarried gentleman in . you papa , in he humourous manner , mention he large possession and riche ; but be he as rich as , he should not have my consent , if he have no greater merit ; though that be what the generality of parent look out for first ; and indeed a easy fortune be so far from be to be disregard , that , when attend with equal merit , I think it ought to have a _preference_ give to it , suppose affections disengage . for ' tis certain , that a man or woman may stand as good a chance for happiness in marriage with a person of fortune , as with one who have not that advantage ; and notwithstand I have neither riche nor descent to boast of , I must be of opinion with those who say , that they never know any body despise either , that have they . but to permit riche to be the _principal_ inducement , to the neglect of superior merit , that be the fault which many a one smart for , whether the choice be they own , or impos upon they by those who have a title to they obedience . here be a saucy body , might some who have not 's kind consideration for she friend , be apt to say , who be thus meanly descende , nevertheless presume to give she opinion , in these high case , unasked . -- but I have this to say ; that I think myself so entirely divest of partiality to my own case , that , as far as my judgment shall permit , I will never have that in view , when I be presum to hint my opinion of general rule . for , most surely , the honour I have receive , and the debasement to which my best friend have subject himself , have , for they principal excuse , that the gentleman be entirely independent , have no question to ask , and have a fortune sufficient to make himself , as well as the person he choose , happy , though she bring he nothing at all ; and that he have , moreover , such a character for good sense , and knowledge of the world , that nobody could impute to he any other inducement , but that of a noble resolution to reward a virtue he have so frequently , and , I will say , so wickedly , try , and could not subdue . my dear miss , let I , as a subject very pleasing to I , touch upon you kind mention of the worthy 's sentiment to that part of he conduct to I , which ( oppress by the terror and apprehension to which I be subject ) once I censure ; and the readier , as I have so great a honour for he cloth , that I think , to be a clergyman , and all that be compassionate , good , and virtuous , be the same thing . but when I come to know , I have a high opinion of he worthiness , and as no one can be perfect in this life , thus I think to myself : how hard be then my lot , to be the cause of stumbl to so worthy a heart . to be sure , a gentleman , one who know , and practise so well , he duty , in every other instance , and preach it so efficaciously to other , must have be _one day sensible , that it would not have mis -become he function and character to have afforde that protection to oppress innocence , which be request of he : and how would it have grieve he considerate mind , have my ruin be complete , that he do not ! but as he have once a nameake , as one may say , that fail in a much greater instance , let not _my want of charity exceed _his_ fault ; but let I look upon it as a infirmity , to which the most perfect be liable ; I be a stranger to he ; a servant girl carry off by she master , a young gentleman of violent and lawless passion , who , in this very instance , shew how much in earnest he be set upon effect all he vile purpose ; and whose heart , although might touch , it be not probable any lesser influence could . then he be not sure , that , though he might assist my escape , I might not afterwards fall again into the hand of so determine a violator : and that difficulty would not , with such a one , enhance he resolution to overcome all obstacle . moreover , he might think , that the person , who be move he to this worthy measure , possibly seek to gratify a view of he own , and that while endeavour to save , to outward appearance , a virtue in danger , he be , in reality , only help another to a wife , at the hazard of expose himself to the vindictiveness of a violent temper , and a rich neighbour , who have power as well as will to resent ; for such be he apprehension , entirely groundless as it be , though not improbable , as it might seem to he . for all these consideration , I must pity , rather than too rigorously censure , the worthy gentleman , and I will always respect he . and thank he a thousand time , my dear , in
in my name , for he goodness in condescending to acknowledge , by you hand , he infirmity , as such ; for this give a excellent proof of the natural worthiness of he heart ; and that it be beneath he to seek to extenuate a fault , when he think he have commit one . indeed , my dear friend , I have so much honour for the clergy of all degree , that I never forget in my prayer one article , that will make they shine light to the world ; since so much depend on they ministry and example , as well with respect to we public as private duty . nor shall the fault of a few make impression upon I to the disadvantage of the order ; for I be afraid a very censorious temper , in this respect , be too generally the indication of a uncharitable and perhaps a profligate heart , level character , in order to cover some inward pride , or secret enormity , which they be asham to avow , and will not be instruct to amend . forgive , my dear , this tedious scribble ; I can not for my life write short letter to those I love . and let I hope that you will favour I with a account of you new affair , and how you proceed in it ; and with such of you conversation , as may give I some notion of a polite courtship . for , alas ! you poor friend know nothing of this . all she courtship be sometimes a hasty snatch of the hand , a black and blue gripe of the arm , and -- " Whither now ? " --" come to I when I bid you ! " and Saucy - face , and , and such like , on he part -- with fear and trembl on mine ; and -- " I will , I will !-- , have mercy ! " at other time a scream , and nobody to hear or mind I ; and with uplift hand , bend knee , and tearful eye -- " for 's sake , pity you poor servant . " this , my dear , be the hard treatment that attend my courtship -- pray , then , let I know , how gentleman court they equal in degree ; how they look when they address you , with they knee bent , sigh , supplicat , and _all that , as say , with the word , , , continually at they tongue 's end . but after all , it will be find , I believe , that be the language and behaviour ever so obsequious , it be all design to end alike -- the , the plain , of the politest address , be ,-- " I be now , dear madam , you humble servant : pray be so good as to let I be you master , "-- " yes , and thank you too , " say the lady 's heart , though not she lip , if she like he . and so they go to church together ; and , in conclusion , it will be happy , if these obsequious courtship end no worse than my frightful one . but I be convince , that with a man of sense , a woman of tolerable prudence _must be happy . that whenever you marry , it may be to such a man , who then must value you as you deserve , and make you happy as I now be , notwithstand all that be past , wish and pray _you oblige friend and servant ,_ [ .--Although could not receive the above letter so soon , as to answer it before other be send to she by she fair correspondent ; yet we think it not amiss to dispense with the order of time , that the reader may have the letter and answer at one view , and shall on other occasion take the like liberty . ] in answer to the preceding_ my . , you charm we all with you letter . say , he will never go to bed , nor rise , but he will pray for you , and desire I will return he thankful acknowledgment for you favourable opinion of he , and kind allowances . if there be a angel on earth , he say , you be one . my papa , although he have see you stinge reflection upon he refusal to protect you , be delighted with you too ; and say , when you come down to again , he will be _undertake by you in good earnest : for he think it be wrong in he to deny you he protection . we all smile at the description of you own uncommon courtship . and , as they say the day of courtship be the happiest part of life , if we have not know that you day of marriage be happier by far than any other body 's courtship , we must need have pitie . but as the one be day of trial and temptation , the other be day of reward and happiness : may the last always continue to be so , and you will have no occasion to think any body happier than . .! I thank you heartily for you good wish as to the man of sense . have be here , and continue he visit . he be a lively gentleman , well enough in he person , have a tolerable character , yet love company , and will take he bottle freely ; my papa like he ne 'er the worse for that : he talk a good deal ; dress gay , and even richly , and seem
seem to like he own person very well -- no great pleasure this for a lady to look forward to ; yet he fall far short of that genteel ease and graceful behaviour , which distinguish you from any body I know . I wish would apply to my sister . she be a ill - natured girl ; but would make a good wife , I hope ; and fancy she would like he well enough . I can not say I do . he laugh too much ; have something boisterous in he conversation : he complaisance be not pretty ; he be , however , well verse in country sport ; and my papa love he for that too , and say --" he be a most accomplished gentleman . " --" yes , " cry I , " as gentleman go . " --" you _must be saucy , " say , " because the man offer himself to you acceptance . a few year hence , perhaps , if you remain single , you will alter you note , Polly , and be willing to jump at a much less worthy tender . " I could not help answer that , although I pay due honour to all my papa be pleased to say , I could not but hope he would be mistaken in this . but I have break my mind to my dear mamma , who tell I , she will do I all the pleasure she can ; but would be loth the youngest daughter should go _first , as she call it . but if I could come and live with you a little now and then , I do not care who marry , unless such a one offer as I never expect . I have great hope the gentleman will be easily persuade to quit I for ; for I see he have not delicacy enough to love with any great distinction . he say , as my mamma tell I by the bye , that I be the handsomest , and best humoure , and he have find out as he think , that I have some wit , and have ease and freedom ( and he tack innocence to they ) in my address and conversation . ' Tis well for I , _he_ be of this opinion : for if he think justly , which I must question , _any body may think so still much more ; for I have be far from take pain to engage he good word , have be under more reserve to he , than ever I be before to any body . indeed , I can not help it : for the gentleman be forward without delicacy ; and ( pardon I , ) my papa have not one bit of it neither ; but be for pushing matter on , with he rough raillery , that put I out of countenance , and have already adjust the sordid part of the preliminary , as he tell I . yet I hope 's three thousand pound fortune more than I be likely to have , will give she the wish - for preference with ; and then , as to a brother - in - law , in prospect , I can put off all restraint , and return to my usual freedom . this be all that occur worthy of notice from we : but from you , we expect a account of 's visit , and of the conversation that offer among you ; and you have so delightful a way of make every thing momentous , either by you subject or reflection , or both , that we long for every post-day , in hope of the pleasure of a letter . and yours I will always carefully preserve , as so many testimony of the honour I receive in this correspondence : which will be always esteem as it deserve , by , my dear , _you oblige and faithful_ POLLy Darnford . , , my papa , mamma , and sister , present they respects . I mention before . he continue to give a very good account of poor Jewkes ; and be much pleased with she . MY , at you desire , and to oblige you honoured mamma , and you good neighbour , I will now acquaint you with the arrival of Lady Davers , and will occasionally write what pass among we , I will not say worthy of notice ; for be I only to do so , I should be more brief , perhaps , by much , than you seem to expect . but as my time be pretty much take up , and I find I shall be obliged to write a bit now , and a bit then , you must excuse I , if I dispense with some form , which I ought to observe , when I write to one I so dearly love ; and so I will give it journal - wise , as it be , and have no regard , when it would fetter or break in upon my freedom of narration , to inscription or subscription ; but send it as I have opportunity , and if you please to favour I so far , as to lend it I , after you have read the stuff , for the perusal of my father and mother , to whom my duty , and promise require I to give a account of my proceedings , it will save I transcription , for which I shall have no time ; and then you will excuse blot and blurs , and I will trouble myself no farther for apology on that score , but this once for all . if you think it worth while when they have read it
it , you shall have it again . , . for my dear friend permit I to rise a hour sooner than usual , that I may have time to scribble ; for he be always pleased to see I so employ , or in reading ; often say , when I be at my needle , ( as he sister once write ) " you maid can do this , : but they can not write as you can . " and yet , as he say , when I choose to follow my needle , as a diversion from too intense study , ( but , alas ! I know not what study be , as may be easily guess by my hasty write , put down every thing as it come ) I shall then do as I please . but I promise at set out , what a good wife I would endeaavor to make : and every honest body should try to be as good as she word , you know , and such particular as I then mention , I think I ought to dispense with as little as possible ; especially as I promise no more than what be my duty to perform , if I have not promise . but what a preamble be here ? judge by it what impertinence you may expect as I proceed . yesterday evening arrive here my and , they nephew , and the Countess of , mother of , whom we do not expect , but take it for the greater favour . it seem she ladyship longe , as she say , to see _me_ ; and this be she principal inducement . the two lady , and they two woman , be in 's coach and six , and my lord and he nephew ride on horseback , attend with a train of servants . we have expect they to dinner ; but they could not reach time enough ; for the countess be a little incommod with she journey , the coach travel slowly . my lady would not suffer she lord , nor he nephew , to come hither before she , though on horseback , because she would be present , she say , when he lordship first see I , he have quite forgot _her mother 's pamela_ ; that be she word . it raine when they come in ; so the coach drive directly to the door , and receive they there ; but I be in a little sort of flutter , which observe , make I sit down in the parlour to compose myself . " 's ? " say my lady , as soon as she alight . I steep out , lest she should take it amiss : and she take my hand , and kiss I : " here , my lady countess , " say she , present I to she , " here be the girl ; see if I say too much in praise of she person . " the countess salute I with a visible pleasure in she eye , and say , " indeed , , you have not . 'Twould have be strange ( excuse I , , for I know you story ) , if such a fine flower have not be transplant from the field to the garden . " I make no return , but by a low curtsey , to she ladyship 's compliment . then take my hand again , present I to she lord : " see here , my lord , my mother 's . " -- " and see here , my lord , " say she generous brother , take my other hand most kindly , " see here you brother 's too ! " my lord salute I : " I do , " say he to he lady , and to he brother ; " and I see the first person in she , that have exceed my expectation , when every mouth have _prepar I to expect a wonder . " , whom every one call , after he aunt 's example , when she be in good humour with he , and who be a very _young gentleman , though about as old as my best friend , come to I next , and say , " Lovelier and lovelier , by my life !-- I never see you peer , . " will you excuse I , my dear , all this seem vanity , for the sake of repeat exactly what pass ? " well , but , " say my lady , take my hand , in she free quality way , which quite dash I , and hold it at a distance , and turn I half round , she eye fix to my waist , " let I observe you a little , my sweet - faced girl ; -- I hope I be right : I hope you will do credit to my brother , as he have do you credit . why do you let she lace so tight , b.? " I be unable to look up , as you may believe , : my face , all over scarlet , be hide in my bosom , and I look so _silly !_-- " ay , " say my naughty lady , " you may well look down , my good girl : for work of this nature will not be long hidden . -- and , oh ! my lady , " ( to the countess ) " see how like a pretty _thief she look ! " " dear my lady ! " say I : for she still keep look at I : and she good brother , see my confusion , in pity to I , press my blushing face a moment
moment to he generous breast , and say , " Lady Davers , you should not be thus hard upon my dear girl , the moment you see she , and before so many witness :-- but look up , my best love , take you revenge of my sister , and tell she , you wish she in the same way . " " it be so then ? " say my lady . " I be glad of it with all my heart . I will now love you better and better : but I almost doubt it , see she still so slender . but if , my good child , you lace too tight , I will never forgive you . " and so she give I a kiss of congratulation , as she say . do you think I do not look very silly ? my lord , smile , and gaze at I from head to foot ; grinn and laugh , like a oaf , as I then , in my spite , thought . indeed the countess say , encouragingly to I , but severely in person of birth , " Lady Davers , you be as much too teazing , as be too bashful . but you be a happy man , , that you lady 's bashfulness be the principal mark by which we can judge she be not of quality . " , in the language of some character in a play , cry out , " _a palpable hit , by !_ " and laugh egregiously , run about from one to another , repeat the same word . we talk only upon common topics till supper - time , and I be all ear , as I think it become I to be ; for the countess have , by she first compliment , and by a aspect as noble as intelligent , overaw I , as I may say , into a respectful silence , to which 's free , though pleasant raillery ( which she could not help carry on now - and - then ) contribute . besides , 's letter have give I still greater reason to revere she wit and judgment than I have before , when I reflect on she passionate temper , and such part of the conversation I have have with she ladyship in you neighbourhood ; which ( however to be admired ) fell short of she letter . when we be to sit down at table , I look , I suppose , a little diffidently : for I really then think of my lady 's anger at the , when she would not have permit I to sit at table with she ; and say , " take you place , my dear ; you keep we friend stand ; " I sit down in my usual seat . and my lady say , " none of you reproach eye , ; I know what you hint at by it ; and every letter I have receive from you have make I censure myself for my _lady - air , as you call th'ey , you sauce - box you : I tell you , I would _lady - air you when I see you ; and you shall have it all in good time . " " I be sure , " say I , " I shall have nothing from you ladyship , but what will be very agreeable : but , indeed , I never mean any thing particular by that , or any other word that I write ; nor could I think of any thing but what be highly respectful to you ladyship . " be pleased to say , that it be impossible I should either write or speak any thing that could be take amiss . lady Davers , after supper , and the servant be withdraw , begin a discourse on title , and say , " brother , I think you should hold yourself oblige to my ; for he have speak to who make he a visit a few day ago , to procure you a baronet 's patent . you estate , and the figure you make in the world , be so considerable , and you family beside be so ancient , that , methinks , you should wish for some distinction of that sort . " " yes , brother , " say my lord , " I do mention it to and tell he , withal , that it be without you knowledge or desire that I speak about it ; and I be not very sure you would accept of it ; but ' ttis a thing you sister have wish for a good while . " " what answer do my make to it ? " say . " he say , ' we , ' mean the ministers , I suppose , ' should be glad to oblige a man of . figure in the world ; but you mention it so slightly , that you can hardly expect courtier will tender it to any gentleman that be so indifferent about it ; for , , we seldom grant honour without a view : I tell you that , ' add he , smile . " " my might mention this as a jest , " return , " but he speak the truth . but you lordship say well , that I be indifferent about it . ' tTis true , ' ti a hereditary title ; but the rich citizen , who use to be satisfied with the title of , ( till they make it so common , that it be bring into as great contempt almost as that of the french knights of , [ 1 ] and nobody care to accept of it ) now
now be ambitious of this ; and , as I apprehend , it be hasten apace into like disrepute . besides , ' ti a novel honour , and what the ancestor of we family , who live at its institution , would never accept of . but be it a peerage , which have some essential privileges and splendour annex to it , to make it desirable to some man , I would not enter into condition for it . titles at best , " add he , " be but shadow ; and he that have the substance should be above value they ; for who that have the whole bird , would pride himself upon a single feather ? " " but , " say my lady , " although I acknowledge that the institution be of late date , yet , as abroad , as well as at home , it be regard as a title of dignity , and the best family among the gentry be suppose to be distinguished by it , I should wish you to accept of it . and as to citizen who have it , they be not many ; and some of this class of people , or they immediate descendant , have buy themselves into the peerage itself of the one kingdom or the other . " [ Footnote 1 : this order be become so scandalously common in , that , to order to suppress it , the hangman be vest with the ensign of it , which effectually abolish it . ] " as to what it be look upon abroad , " say , " this be of no weight at all ; for when a Englishman travel , be he of what degree he will , if he have a equipage , and squander he money away , he be a lord of course with foreigner : and therefore - a - one be rather a diminution to he , as it give he a lower title than he vanity would perhaps make he aspire to be think in the possession of . then , as to citizen , in a trading nation like this , I be not displease in the main , with see the overgrown one creepe into nominal honour ; and we have so many of we first title family , who have ally themselves to trade , ( whose inducement be money only ) that it cease to be either a wonder as to the fact , or a disgrace as to the honour . " " well , brother , " say my lady , " I will tell you farther , the thing may be have for ask for ; if you will but go to court , and desire to kiss the king 's hand , that will be all the trouble you will have : and pray now oblige I in it . " " if a title would make I either a better or a wiser man , " reply , " I would embrace it with pleasure . besides , I be not so satisfied with some of the measure now pursue , as to owe any obligation to the ministers . accept of a small title from they , be but like put on they badge , or list under they banners ; like a certain lord we all know , who accept of one degree more of title to show he be theirs , and would not have a higher , lest it should be think a satisfaction tantamount to half the pension he demand : and could I be easy to have it suppose , that I be a ungrateful man for voting as I please , because they give I the title of a baronet ? " the countess say , the world always think to be a man of steady principle , and not attach to any party ; but , in she opinion , it be far from be inconsistent with any gentleman 's honour and independency , to accept of a title from a prince he acknowledge as he sovereign . " ' very true . madam , that I be attach to no party , nor ever will . I will be a _country gentleman , in the true sense of the word , and will accept of no favour that shall make any one think I would _not be of the opposition when I think it a necessary one ; as , on the other hand , I should scorn to make myself a round to any man 's ladder of preferment , or a caballer for the sake of my own . " " you say well , brother , " return ; " but you may undoubtedly keep you own principle and independency , and yet pay you duty to the king , and accept of this title ; for you family and fortune will be a greater ornament to the title , than the title to you . " " then what occasion have I for it , if that be the case , ? " " why , I can not say , but I should be glad you have it , for you family 's sake , as it be a hereditary honour . then it would mmend the style of you spouse here ; for the good girl be at such a loss for a epithet when she write , that I see the constraint she lie under . it be , ' _My dear gentleman , my best friend , my benefactor , my dear B._' whereas would turn off she period more roundly , and no other softer epithets would be want . " " to I , " reply he , " who always desire to be distinguished as my 's best friend , and think
think it a honour to be call _her dear . and she dear man , this reason weigh very little , unless there be no other in the kingdom than _her_ : for I be very emulous of she favour , I can tell you , and think it no small distinction . " I blush at this too great honour , before such company , and be afraid my lady would be a little picque at it . but after a pause , she say , " well , then , brother , will you let decide upon this point ? " " Rightly put , " say the countess . " pray let . choose for you , . my lady have hit the thing . " " very good , by my soul , " say ; " let my _young aunt _, " that be he word , " choose for you , . " " well , then , , " say , " give we you opinion , as to this point . " " but , first , " say , " say you will be determine by it ; or else she will be lay under a difficulty . " " well , then , " reply he , " be it so -- I will be determine by you opinion , my dear ; give it I freely . " rub he hand together , " charme , charme , as I hope to live ! by , this be just as I wish ! " " well , now , , " say my lady , " speak you true heart without disguise : I charge you do . " " why then , gentleman and lady , " say I , " if I must be so bold as to speak on a subject , upon which on several account , it would become I to be silent , I should be _against the title ; but perhaps my reason be of too private a nature to weigh any thing : and if so , it would not become I to have any choice at all . " they all call upon I for my reason ; and I say , look down a little abashed , " it be this : here my dear . have disparage himself by distinguishing , as he have do , such a low creature as I ; and the world will be apt to say , he be seek to repair _one way the honour he have lose _another !_ and then perhaps , it will be attribute to my pride and ambition : ' here , they will perhaps say , ' the proud cottager will need be a lady in hope to conceal she descent ;' whereas , have I such a vain thought , it would be but make it the more remember against both and myself . and indeed , as to my own part , I take too much pride in have be lift up into this distinction for the cause to which I owe it , you brother 's _bounty and _generosity , than to be asham of what I _be : only now - and - then I be concerned for he own sake , lest he should be too much censured . but this would not be prevent , but rather be promote by the title . so I be humbly of opinion against the title . " . have hardly patience to hear I out , but come to I and fold he arm about I , say , " just as I wish , have you answer , my belov ; I be never yet deceive in you ; no , not once . " " madam , " say he to the countess , " , , do we want any title , think you , to make we happy but what we can confer upon ourselves ? " and he press my hand to he lip , as he always honour I most in company and go to he place highly pleased ; while he fine manner drew tear from my eye , and make he noble sister 's and the countess 's glisten too . " well , for my part , " say , " thou be a strange girl : where , as my brother once say , gottest thou all this ? " then pleasantly humorous , as if she be angry , she change she tone , " what signify thy _meek_ word and _humble speech when by thy _action , as well as _sentiment , thou reflectest upon we all ? , " say she , " have less merit , or take care to conceal it better : I shall otherwise have no more patience with thee , than thy monarch have just now shewn . " the countess be pleased to say , " you be a happy couple indeed ! " such sort of entertainment as this you be to expect from you correspondent . I can not do better than I can ; and it may appear such a mixture of self - praise , vanity , and impertinence , that I expect you will tell I freely , as soon as this come to you hand , whether it be tolerable to you . yet I must write on , for my dear father and mother 's sake , who require it of I , and be prepared to approve of every thing that come from I , for no other reason but that : and I think you ought to leave I to write to they only , as I can not hope it will be entertain to any body else , without expect as much partiality and favour from other , as I have from my dear parent
parent . mean time I conclude here my first conversation - piece ; and am , and will be , _always yours , &c._ P.B. , . we breakfast conversation yesterday ( at which only , my lady 's woman , and my attend ) be so whimsically particular , ( though I doubt some of it , at least , will appear too trifling ) that I must acquaint my dear with it , who be desirous of know all that relate to 's conduct towards I . you must know , then , I have the honour to stand very high in the graces of , who on every occasion be pleased to call I he _good sister , he _dear sister , and sometimes he _charm , and he say , he will not be out of my company for a hour together , while he stay here , if he can help it . my lady seem to relish this very well in the main , though she can not quite so readily , yet , frame she mouth to the sound of the word _Sister , as my lord do ; of which this that follow be one instance . he lordship have call I by that tender name twice before , and say , " I will drink another dish , I think , my _good " my lady say , " you lordship have get a word by the end , that you seem mighty fond of : I have take notice , that you have call , , , no less than three time in a quarter of a hour . " my lord look a little serious : " I shall one day , " say he , " be allow to choose my own word and phrase , I hope -- you sister , , " add he , " often question whether I be at age or not , though the house of Peers make no scruple of admit I among they some year ago . " say severely , but with a smile air , " 'Tis well she have such a gentleman as you lordship for a husband , whose affectionate indulgence to she make you overlook all she saucy sally ! I be sure , when you take she out of we family into you own , we all think ourselves , I in particular , bound to pray for you . " I think this a great trial of my lady 's patience : but it be from . and she say , with a half - pleasant , half - serious air , " how now , confidence !-- none but my brother could have say this , whose violent spirit be always much more intolerable than mine : but I can tell you , , I be always think very good - humoured and oblige to every body , till you impudence come from college , and from you travels ; and then , I own , you provoke way make I now - and - then a little out of the way . " " well , well , sister , we will have no more of this subject ; only let we see that my Davers want 's not he proper authority with you , although you use to keep _me_ in awe formerly . " " keep _you_ in awe !-- that nobody could ever do yet , boy or man . but , my lord , I beg you pardon ; for this brother will make mischief betwixt we if he can -- I only take notice of the word _sister_ so often use , which look more like affectation than affection . " " perhaps , , " say my lord , gravely , " I have two reason for use the word so frequently . " " I would be glad to hear they , " say the dear taunt lady ; " for I do not doubt they be mighty good one . what be they , my lord ? " " one be , because I love , and be fond of my new relation : the other , that you be so sparing of the word , that I call she so for we both . " " you lordship say well , " reply , smile : " and can give two reason why she do _not _. " " well , " say my lady , " now we be in r't , let we hear _your_ two reason likewise ; I doubt not they be wise one too . " " if they be _yours , , they must be so . one be , that every condescension ( to speak in a proud lady 's dialect ) come with as much difficulty from she , as a favour from the house of to the petty prince of . the second , because those of you sex --( excuse I , Madam , " to the countess ) " who have once make scruple , think it inconsistent with themselves to be over hasty to alter they own conduct , choose rather to persist in a error , than own it to be one . " this proceed from he impatience to see I in the least slighte by my lady ; and I say to , to soften matter , " never , my lord , be brother and sister so loving in earnest , and yet so satirical upon each other in , as my good lady and . but you lordship know they way . " my lady frown at she brother , but turn it off with a air : " I love the mistress of this house , " say she , " very well ; and be quite reconcile to she : but methink there be
be such a hiss sound in the word _Sister , that I can not abide it . ' tTis a true English word , but a word I have not be use to , have never have a sis - - s - ter before , as you know ," -- speak the first syllable of the word with a emphatical hiss . say , " observe you not , , that you use a word ( to avoid that ) which have twice the hissing in it that _sister have ? and that be tmis -s 's -tress , with two other hissing word to accompany it , of this - s - 's hous - s - e : but to what childish folly do not pride make one stoop !--Excuse , Madam " ( to the countess ) , " such poor low conversation as we be dwindle into . " " of , " say she ladyship , " the conversation be very agreeable ; -- and I think , , you be fairly catch . " " well , " say my lady , " then help I , good _sister _-- there be for you !-- to a little sugar . will that please you , ? " " I be always pleased , " reply she brother , smile , " when act up to she own character , and the good sense she be mistress of . " " ay , ay , my good brother , like other wise man , take it for grant that it be a mark of good sense to approve of whatever _he_ do . -- and so , for this one time , I be a very sensible body with he -- and I will leave off , while I have he good word . only one thing I must say to you , my dear , " turn to I , " that though I call you , as I please , be assure , I love you as well as if I call you _sister , as do , at every word . " " you ladyship give I great pleasure , " say I , " in this kind assurance ; and I do not doubt but I shall have the honour of be call by that tender name , if I can be so happy as to deserve it ; and I will lose no opportunity that shall be afforde I , to show how sincerely I will endeaavor to do so . " she be pleased to rise from she seat : " give I a kiss , my dear girl ; you deserve every thing : and permit I to say sometimes , as the word occur : for I be not use to speak in print ; and I will call you _sister_ when I think of it , and love you as well as ever sister love another . " " these proud and passionate folk , " say , " how good they can be , when they reflect a little on what become they character ! " " so , then , " rejoin my lady , " I be to have no merit of my own , I see , do what I will . this be not quite so generous in my brother , as one might expect . " " why , you saucy sister -- excuse I . -- what merit _would you assume ? can people merit by do they duty ? and be it so great a praise , that you think fit to own for a sister so deserve a girl as this , whom I take pride in call my wife ? " " thou be what thou always wert , " return my lady ; " and be I in this my imputed pride to want a excuse , I know not the creature live , that ought so soon to make one for I , as you . " " I _do_ excuse you , " say he , " for _that very reason , if you please : but it little become either you pride , or mine , to do any thing that want excuse . " " Mighty moral ! mighty grave , truly !-- , friend , sister , -- there be for you !-- thou art a happy girl to have make such a reformation in thy honest man 's way of _think as well as _acting . but now we be upon this topic , and only friend about we , I be resolve to be even with thee , brother -- , if you be not for another dish , I wish you would withdraw . , we do not want you . , you may stay . " obey ; and Polly go out ; for you must know , , that my lady Davers will have none of the man -fellow , as she call they , to attend upon we at tea . and I can not say but I think she entirely in the right , for several reason that might be give . when they be withdraw , my lady repeat , " now we be upon this topic of reclaiming and reformation , tell I , thou bold wretch ; for you know I have see all you roguery in 's papers ; tell I , if ever rake but thyself make such a attempt as thou didst , on this dear good girl , in presence of a virtuous woman , as be always note to be ? as to the other vile creature , , ' ttis less wonder , although in _that thou hadst the impudence of _him_ who set thee to work : but to make thy attempt before , and in spite of _her_ struggle and reproach ,
, be the very stretch of shameless wickedness . " seem a little disconcert , and say , " surly , , this be go too far ! look at 's blushing face , and downcast eye , and wonder at yourself for this question , as much as you do at I for the action you speak of . " the countess say to I , " my dear , I wonder not at this sweet confusion on so affect a question !-- but , indeed , since it be come in so naturally , I must say , , that we have all , and my daughter too , wonder at this , more than at any part of you attempt ; because , , we think you one of the most civilized man in , and that you could not but wish to have save appearances at least . " " though this be to you , my , the renewal of grief ; yet hold up you dear face . you may -- the triumph be yours -- the shame and the blush ought to be mine -- and I will humour my saucy sister in all she would have I say . " " Nay , " say , " you know the question ; I can not put it stronger . " " that be very true , " reply he : " but would you expect I should give you a _reason for a attempt that appear to you so very shocking ? " " , , " say the countess , " do not say _appear to Lady Davers ; for ( excuse I ) it will appear so to every one who hear of it . " " I think my brother be too hardly use , " say ; " he have make all the amend he could make :-- and _you_, my sister , who be the person offend , forgive he now , I hope ; do not you ? " I could not answer ; for I be quite confound ; and make a motion to withdraw : but say , " do not go , my dear : though I ought to be asham of a action set before I in so full a glare , in presence of and the countess ; yet I will not have you stir because I forget how you represent it , and you must tell I . " " indeed , , I can not , " say I ; " pray , my dear lady -- pray , my good lord -- and , dear , do not thus k_renow my grief , as you be pleased justly to phrase it . " " I have the representation of that scene in my pocket , " say my lady ; " for I be resolve , as I tell , to shame the wicked wretch with it the first opportunity ; and I will read it to you ; or rather , you shall read it yourself , bold - face , if you can . " so she pull those leave out of she pocket , wrap up carefully in a paper . " here ,-- I believe he who could act thus , must read it ; and , to spare 's confusion , read it to yourself ; for we all know how it be . " " I think , " say he , take the papers , " I can say something to abate the heinousness of this heavy charge , or else I should not stand thus at the insolent bar of my sister , answer she interrogatory . " I send you , my dear , a transcript of the charge . to be sure , you will say , he be a very wicked man . read it to himself , and say , " this be a dark affair , as here state ; and I can not say , but , and too , have great reason to apprehend the worst : but surely reader of it , who be less party in the suppose attempt , and not determine at all event to condemn I , might have make a more favourable construction for I , than you , , have do in the strong light in which you have set this heinous matter before we . " however , since my lady , " bow to the countess , " and seem to expect I particularly to answer this black charge , I will , at a proper time , if agreeable , give you a brief history of my passion for this dear girl ; how it commence and increase , and my own struggle with it , and this will introduce , with some little advantage to myself perhaps , what I have to say , as to this suppose attempt : and at the same time enable you the better to account for some fact which you have read in my pretty accuser 's papers . " this please every one , and they beg he to begin _than ; but he say , it be time we should think of dressing , the morning be far advanced ; and if no company come in , he would , in the afternoon , give they the particular they desire to hear . the three gentleman ride out , and return to dress before dinner : my lady and the countess also take a airing in the chariot . just as they return , compliment come from several of the neighbour lady to we noble guest , on they arrival in these part ; and to as many as sent , desire they company for to - morrow afternoon , to tea ; but . have fall in with some of the gentleman likewise ,
, he tell I , we should have most of we visiting neighbour at dinner , and desire might prepare accordingly for they . after dinner take a ride out , attend by , of whom he be very fond , ever since he frightene 's footman at the hall , threaten to chine they , if they offer to stop he lady : for , he say , he love a man of courage : very probably know he own defect that way , for my lady often call he a chicken - hear fellow . and then and , and the countess , revive the subject of the morning ; and be pleased to begin in the manner I shall mention by - and - bye . for here I be oblige to break off . now , my dear , I will proceed . " I begin , " say , " very early to take notice of this lovely girl , even when she be hardly thirteen year old ; for she charms increase every day , not only in my eye , but in the eyes of all who beheld she . my mother , as _you_ ( Lady Davers ) know , take the greatest delight in she , always call she , she , she good child : and she wait -maid and she cabinet of rarity be she boast , and equally shewn to every visitor : for besides the beauty of she figure , and the genteel air of she person , the dear girl have a surprising memory , a solidity of judgment above she year , and a docility so unequalled , that she take all part of learning which she lady , as fond of instruct she as she of improve by instruction , crowd upon she ; insomuch that she have master to teach she to dance , s , and play on the spinnet , whom she every day surprise by the readiness wherewith she take every thing . " I remember once , my mother praise she girl before I , and my aunt b . ( who be since dead ) , I could not but notice she fondness for she , and say , ' what do you design , Madam , to do _with or _for , this Pamela of yours ? the accomplishment you give she will do she more hurt than good ; for they will set she so much above she degree , that what you intend as a kindness , may prove she ruin . ' " my aunt join with I , and speak in a still stronger manner against give she such a education : and add , as I well remember , ' surly , sister , you do wrong . one would think , if one know not my nephew 's discreet pride , that you design she for something more than you own waiting - maid . ' " 'Ah ! sister , ' say the old lady , ' there be no fear of what you hint at ; he family pride , and stately temper , will secure my son : he have too much of he father in he . and as for , you know not the girl . she have always in she thought , and in she mouth , too , she parent 's mean condition , and I shall do nothing for _them , at least at present , though they be honest folk , and deserve well , because I will keep the girl humble . ' " ' but what can I do with the little baggage ? ' continue my mother ; ' she conquer every thing so fast , and have such a thirst after knowledge , and the more she know , I verily think , the humbler she be , that I can not help let go , as my son , when a little boy , use to do to he kite , as fast as she pull ; and to what height she will soar , I can not tell . " 'I intend , ' proceed the good lady , ' at first , only to make she mistress of some fine needle - work , to qualify she ( as she have a delicacy in she person , that make it a pity ever to put she to hard work ) for a genteel place ; but she master that so fast , that now as my daughter be marry and go from I , I be desirous to qualify she to divert and entertain I in my thoughtful hour : and be _you , sister , to know what she be capable of , and how divert she innocent prattle be to I , and she natural simplicity , which I encourage she to preserve amidst all she learn , you would not , nor my son neither , wonder at the pleasure I take in she . shall I call she in ? ' " 'I do not want , ' say I , 'to have the girl call in : if you , , be divert with she , that be enough . to be sure , be a better companion for a lady , than a monkey or a harlequin : but I fear you will set she above herself , and make she vain and pert ; and that , at last , in order to support she pride , she may fall into temptation which may be fatal to herself , and other too . ' " 'I be glad to hear this from my _son _, ' reply the good lady . ' but the moment I see my favour puff she up , I shall take other measure . ' " ' well , ' think I to myself
myself , ' I only want to conceal my view from you penetrating eye , my good mother ; and I shall one day take as much delight in you girl , and she accomplishment , as you now do ; so go on , and improve she as fast as you will . I will only now and then talk against she , to blind you ; and doubt not that all you do will qualify she the better for my purpose . only , ' think I , ' fly swiftly on , two or three more tardy year , and I will nip this bud by the time it begin to open , and place it in my bosom for a year or two at least : for so long , if the girl behave worthy of she education , I doubt not , she will be new to I .-- excuse I , lady ;--excuse I , ; -- if I be not ingenuous , I have better be silent . " I will not interrupt this affect narration , by mention my own alternate blush , confusion , and exclamation , as the naughty man go on ; nor the censure , and many out upon you be of the attentive lady , and , brother 's , of ; nor yet with apology for the praise on myself , so frequently intermingle -- contente myself to give you , as near as I can recollect , the very sentence of the dear relator . and as to we occasional exclaiming and observation , you may suppose what they be . " so , " continue , " I go on drop hints against she now and then ; and whenever I meet she in the passage about the house , or in the garden , avoid to look at , or to speak to she , as she pass I , curtsey , and put on a thousand bewitching air of obligingness and reverence ; while I ( who think the best way to demolish the influence of such a education , would be not to alarm she fear on one hand , or to familiarize myself to she on the other , till I come to strike the blow ) look haughty and reserve , and pass by she with a stiff nod at most . or , if I speak , ' how do you lady this morning , girl ?-- I hope she rest well last night :' then , cover with blush , and curtsey at every word , as if she think herself unworthy of answer my question , she would trip away in a kind of confusion , as soon as she have speak . and once I hear she say to , ' dear sirs , my young master speak to I , and call I by my name , say -- how sleep you lady last night , ?-- be not that very good , ,' think I , 'I be in the right way , I find : this will do in proper time . go on , my dear mother , improve as fast as you will : I will engage to pull down in three hour , what you will be build up in as many year , in spite of all the lesson you can teach she . ' " ' enough for I , that I be establish in you , lady , and in you , my lord , a higher esteem for my ( I be but too sensible I shall lose a good deal of my own reputation ) in the relation I be now give you . " I dress , grow more confident , and as insolent withal , as if , though I have not 's wit and virtue , I have all she spirit --( excuse I , Lady Davers ;) and have a pretty bold heart , which rather put I upon courting than avoid a danger or difficulty , I have but too much my way with every body ; and many a menace complaint have I _look down , with a haughty air , and a promptitude , like that of 's to you footman at the , to clap my hand to my side ; which be of the greater service to my bold enterprise , as two or three gentleman have find I know how to be in earnest . " " ! " say my lady , " thou wast ever a impudent fellow : and many a vile roguery have I keep from my poor mother . -- yet , to my knowledge , she think you no saint . " " ay , poor lady , " continue he , " she use now - and - then to catechize I ; and be _sure_ I be not so good as I ought to be :--' for , son , ' she would cry , ' these late hour , these all night work , and to come home so _sober can not be right . - I be not sure , if I be to know all , ( and yet I be afraid of inquire after you way ) whether I should not have reason to wish you be bring home in wine , rather than to come in so sober , and so late , as you do . ' " once , I remember , in the summer - time , I come home about six in the morning , and meet the good lady unexpectedly by the garden back - door , of which I have a key to let myself in at all hour . I start , and would have avoid she : but she call I to she , and then I approach she with a air , '
' what bring you , Madam , into the garden at so early a hour ? ' turn my face from she ; for I have a few scratch on my forehead -- with a thorn , or so -- which I fear she would be more inquisitive about than I care she should . " ' and what make you , ' say she , 'so early here , ? -- what a rakish figure dost thou make !-- one time or other these course will yield you but little comfort , on reflection : would to thou wast but happily marry ! ' " 'So , , the old wish !-- I be not so bad as you think I :-- I hope I have not merit so great a punishment . ' " these hint I give , not as matter of glory , but shame : yet I ought to tell you all the truth , or nothing . ' meantime , ' think I , ( for I use to have some compunction for my vile practice , when cool reflection , bring on by satiety , have take hold of I ) 'I wish this sweet girl be grow to year of susceptibility , that I might reform this wicked course of life , and not prowl about , disturb honest folk ' peace , and endanger myself . ' and as I have , by a certain very daring and wicked attempt , in which , however , I do not succeed , set a hornet 's nest about my ear , which I begin to apprehend would s I to death , have once escape a ambush by dint of mere good luck ; I think it better to remove the seat of my warfare into another kingdom , and to be a little more discreet for the future in my amour . so I go to a second time , and pass a year there in the best of company , and with some improvement both to my moral and understanding ; and have a very few sally , consider my love of intrigue , and the ample mean I have to prosecute successfully all the desire of my heart . " when I return , several matches be propose to I , and my good mother often request I to make she so happy , as she call it , as to see I marry before she die ; but I could not endure the thought of the state : for I never see a lady whose temper and education I like , or with whom I think I could live tolerably . she use in vain therefore to plead family reason to I :-- like most young fellow , I be too much a self - lover , to pay so great a regard to posterity ; and , to say truth , have little solicitude at that time , whether my name be continue or not , in my own descendant . however , I look upon my mother 's Pamela with no small pleasure , and I find she so much improve , as well in person as behaviour , that I have the less inducement either to renew my intriguing life , or to think of a married state . " Yet , as my mother have all she eye about she , as the phrase be , I affect great shyness , both before she , and to the girl ; for I doubt not , my very look would be watch by they both ; and what the one discover would not be a secret to the other ; and lay myself open too early to a suspicion , I think , would but ice the girl over , and make she lady more watchful . " so I use to go into my mother 's apartment , and come out of it , without take the least notice of she , but put on stiff air ; and as she always withdraw when I come in , I never make any pretence to keep she there . " once , indeed , my mother , on my look after she , when she back be turn , say , ' my dear son , I do not like you eye follow my girl so intently .-- only I know that sparkl lustre natural to it , or I should have some fear for my , as she grow older . ' " '_I look after she . madam !-_my_ eye sparkle at such a girl as that ! no indeed ! she may be you favourite as a waiting - maid ; but I see nothing but clumsy curtsey and awkward air about she . a little rustic affectation of innocence , that to such a can not see into she , may pass well enough . ' " ' Nay , my dear , ' reply my mother , ' do not say that , of all thing . she have no affectation , I be sure . ' " ' yes , she have , in my eye , madam , and I will tell you how it be ; you have teach she to assume the air of a gentlewoman , to dance , and to enter a room with a grace ; and yet bid she keep she low birth and family in view : and between the one character , which she want to get into , and the other she dare not get out of , she trip up and down mincingly , and know not how to set she foot : so ' ti the same in every gesture : she arm she know not whether to swim with , or to hold before she , nor whether to hold she head up or down ; and
and so do neither , but hang it on one side : a little awkward piece of one - and - t'other I think she . and , indeed , you would do the girl more kindness to put she into you dairy , than to keep she about you person ; for she will be utterly spoiled , I doubt , for any useful purpose . ' " 'Ah , son ! ' say she , 'i fear , by you description , you have mind she too much in one sense , though not enough in another . ' not my intention to recommend she to you notice , of all man ; and I doubt not , if it please I live , and she continue a good girl , but she will make a man of some middling , genteel business , very happy . ' " come in just then , with a air so natural , so humble , and yet so much above herself , that I be force to turn my head from she , lest my mother should watch my eye again , and I be inclin to do she that justice , which my heart assent to , but which my lip have just before deni she . " all my difficulty , in apprehension , be my good mother ; the effect of whose lesson to she girl , I be not so much afraid of as she vigilance . ' for ,' think I , 'I see by the delicacy of she person , the brilliancy of she eye , and the sweet apprehensiveness that play about every feature of she face , she must have tinder enough in she constitution , to catch a well - strike spark ; and I will warrant I shall know how to set she in a blaze , in a few month more . ' " yet I want , as I pass , to catch she attention too : I expect she to turn after I , and look so as to show a like towards I ; for I have a great opinion of my person and air , which have be fortunately distinguished by the ladie , whom , of course , my vanity make I allow to be very good judge of these outward advantage . " but to my great disappointment , never , by any favourable glance , give the least encouragement to my vanity . ' well , ' think I , ' this girl have certainly nothing ethereal in she mould : all unanimated clay ! -- but the dancing and singe air my mother be teach she , will better qualify she in time , and another year will ripen she into my arm , no doubt of it . let I only go on thus , and make she _fear_ I : that will enhance in she mind every favour I shall afterwards vouchsafe to show she : and never question old _humdrum_ , ' think I , ' but the tempter _without , and the tempter _within , will be too many for the perversest nicety that ever the sex boast . ' " Yet , though I could not once attract she eye towards I , she never fail to draw mine after she , whenever she go by I , or wherever I see she , except , as I say , in my mother 's presence ; and particularly when she have pass I , and could not see I look at she , without turn she head , as I expect so often from she in vain . " you will wonder , , who , I suppose , be once in love , or you would never have marry such a hostile spirit as my sister 's there - " " go on , sauce -- box , " say she , " I will not interrupt you . " " you will wonder how I could behave so coolly as to escape all discovery so long from a lady so watchful as my mother , and from the apprehensiveness of the girl . " but , to say nothing of she tender year , and that my love be not of this bashful sort , I be not absolutely determined , so great be my pride , that I ought to think she worthy of be my _mistress , when I have not much reason , as I think , to despair of prevailing upon person of higher birth ( be I dispose to try ) to live with I upon my own term . my pride , therefore , keep my passion at bay , as I may say : so far be I from imagine I should ever be bring to what have since happen ! but to proceed : " Hitherto my mind be take up with the beauty of she person only . my Eye have draw my heart after it , without give myself any trouble about that sense and judgment which my mother be always praise in she Pamela , as exceed she year and opportunity : but a occasion happen , which , though slight in itself , take the head into the party , and I think of she , young as she be , with a distinction , that before I have not for she . it be this : " be with my mother in she closet , who be talk to I on the old subject , _matrimony , I see 's commonplace book , as I may call it ; in which , by she lady 's direction , from time to time , she have transcribe from the , and other good book , such passage as most impress she as she read -- a method , I take it , my
my dear " ( _turn to me_ ) , " of great service to you , as it initiate you into writing with that freedom and ease , which shine in you saucy letter and journal ; and to which my present fetter be not a little owing : just as pedlar catch monkey in the baboon kingdom , provoke the attentive fools , by they own example , to put on shoe and stocking , till the ap of imitation , try to do the like , entangle they foot , and so can not escape upon the bough of the tree of liberty , on which before they be will not to hop and skip about , and play a thousand puggish trick . " I observ the girl write a pretty hand , and very swift and free ; and affix she point or stop with so much judgment ( she year consider ) , that I begin to have a high opinion of she understanding . some observation likewise upon several of the passage be so just and solid , that I could not help be tacitly surprise at they . " my mother watch my eye , and be silent : I see not to observe that she do ; and after a while , laid down the book , shutt it with great indifference , and talk of another subject . " upon this , my mother say , ' do not you think write a pretty hand , son ? ' " 'I do not mind it much , ' say I , with a careless air . ' this be she writing , be it ? ' take the book , and open it again , at a place of . ' the girl be mighty pious ! ' say I . " 'i wish _you_ be so , child . ' " 'I wish so too , Madam , if it would please _you _. ' " 'I wish so , for you _own_ sake , child . ' " 'So do I , ;' and down I lay the book again very carelessly . " ' look once more in it , ' say she , ' and see if you can not open it upon some place that may strike you . ' " I open it at -- '_ train up a child in the way it should go _, ' & c . 'i fancy , ' say I , ' when I be of 's age , I be pretty near as good as she . ' " ' never , never , ' say my mother ; 'I be sure I take great pain with you ; but , alas I to very little purpose . you have always a violent headstrong will . ' " ' some allowances for boy and girl , I hope , Madam ; but you see I be as good for a man as my sister for a woman . ' " ' no indeed , you be not , I do assure you . ' " 'I be sorry for that . madam ; you give I a sad opinion of myself . ' " " brazen wretch ! " say my lady ; " but go on . " " ' to one of the girl 's observation on some text , ' say my mother . " I do ; and be pleased with it more than I would own . ' the girl 's well enough , ' say I , ' for what she be ; but let 's see what she will be a few year hence . then will be the trial . ' " ' she will be always good , I doubt not . ' " 'So much the better for she . but can not we talk of any other subject ? you complain how seldom I attend you ; and when you be always talk of matrimony , or of this low - bear , raw girl , it must need lessen the pleasure of approache you . ' " but now , as I hint to you , lady , and my lord , I have a still higher opinion of ; and esteem she more worthy of my attempt . ' for ,' think I , ' the girl have good sense , and it will be some pleasure to watch by what gradation she may be make to rise into love , and into a higher life , than that to which she be bear . ' and so I begin to think she would be worthy in time of be my _mistress ,_ which , till now , as I say before , I have be a little scrupulous about . " I take a little tour soon after this in company of some friend , with whom I have contract a intimacy abroad , into and , they have a curiosity to see those country , and we spend six or eight month on this expedition ; and when I have land they in , I return home , and find my good mother in a very indifferent state of health , but she arrive to a height of beauty and perfection which exceed all my expectation . I be so take with she charms when I first see she , which be in the garden , with a book in she hand , just come out of a little summer - house , that I then think of oblige she to go back again , in order to begin a parley with she : but while I be resolve , she tript away with she curtesy and reverence , and be out of my sight before I could determine . " I be resolve , however , not to be long without she
she ; and have be recommend to I a little before , by a brother - rake , as a woman of try fidelity , I ask she if she would be faithful , if I have occasion to commit a pretty girl to she care ? " she hope , she say , it would be with the lady 's own consent , and she should make no scruple in obey I . " so I think I would way - lay the girl , and carry she first to a little village in , to a acquaintance of 's . and when I have bring she to be easy and pacify a little , I design that should attend she to Lincolnshire : for I know there be no coming at she here , under my mother 's wing , by she own consent , and that to offer term to she , would be to blow up my project all at once . besides , I be sensible , that Jervis would stand in the way of my proceedings as well as my mother . " the method I have contrive be quite easy , as I imagine , and such as could not have fail to answer my purpose , as to carry she off ; and I doubt not of make she well satisfi in she good fortune very quickly ; for , have a notion of she affectionate duty to she parent , I be not displease that I could make the term very easy and happy to they all . " what must stand in my way , be my mother 's fondness for she : but suppose I have get she favourite in my hand , which appear to I , as I say , a task very easy to be conquer , I have actually form a letter for she to transcribe , acknowledge a love -affair , and lay she withdraw herself so privately , to a implicit obedience to she husband 's command , to whom she be marry that morning , and who , be a young gentleman of genteel family , and dependent on he friend , be desirous of keep it all a profound secret ; and begge , on that account , she lady not to divulge it , so much as to . " and to prepare for this , and make she escape the more probable , when matter be ripe for my plot , I come in one night , and examine all the servants , and , the latter in my mother 's hearing , about a genteel young man , whom I pretend to find with a pillion on the horse he ride upon , wait about the back door of the garden , for somebody to come to he ; and who ride off , when I come up to the door , as fast as he could . nobody know any thing of the matter , and they be much surprised at what I tell they : but I beg might be watch , and that no one would say any thing to she about it . " my mother say , she have two reason not to speak of it to : one to oblige I : the other and chief , because it would break the poor innocent girl 's heart , to be suspect . ' poor dear child ! ' say she , ' whither can she go , to be so happy as with I ? would it not be inevitable ruin to she to leave I ? there be nobody come after she : she receive no letter , but now - and - then one from she father and mother , and those she shew I . ' " ' well , ' reply I , ' I hope she can have no design ; ' twould be strange if she have for any to leave so good a mistress ; but you can not be _sure_ all the letter she receive be from she father ; and she shew to you those he write , look like a cloak to other she may receive from another hand . but it can be no harm to have a eye upon she . you do not know , , what trick there be in the world . ' " ' not I , indeed ; but only this I know , that the girl shall be under no restraint , if she be resolve to leave I , well as I love she . ' " . say , she would have a eye upon , in obedience to my command , but she be sure there be no need ; nor would she so much wound the poor child 's peace , as to mention the matter to she . " this I suffer to blow off , and see to my mother to have so good a opinion of she , that I be sorry , as I tell she , I have such a surmise : say , that though the fellow and the pillion be odd circumstance , yet I da to say , there be nothing in it : for I doubt not , the girl 's duty and gratitude would hinder she from do a foolish or rash thing . " this my mother hear with pleasure : although my motive be but to lay on the thicker to she , when she be to be tell she have escape . " she be _glad_ I be not a enemy to the poor child . ' have no friend but I , ' continue she ; ' and if I do not provide for she , I shall have do she more harm than good ( as you and you aunt . have often say , )
) in the accomplishment I have give she : and yet the poor girl , I see that , ' add she , ' would not be backward to turn she hand to any thing for the sake of a honest livelihood , be she put to it ; which , if it please to spare I , and she continue good , she never shall be . ' " I wonder not , , at you tear on this occasion . you lady be a excellent woman , and deserve this tribute to she memory . all my pleasure now be , that she know not half my wick prank , and that I do not vex she worthy heart in the prosecution of this scheme ; which would have give I a severe sting , inasmuch as I might have apprehend , with too much reason , that I have shorten she day by the knowledge of the one and the other . " I have thus every thing ready for the execution of my project : but my mother 's ill state of health give I too much concern , to permit I to proceed . and , now - and - then , as my frequent attendance in she illness give I a opportunity of observe more and more of the girl ; she affectionate duty , and continual tear ( finde she often on she knee , pray for she mistress , ) I be move to pity she ; and while those scene of my mother 's illness and decline be before I , I would resolve to conquer , if possible , my guilty passion , as those scene teach I , while they impression hold , justly to call it ; and I be much concerned to find it so difficult a task ; for , till now , I think it principally owe to my usual enterprising temper , and a love of intrigue ; and that I have nothing to do but to resolve against it , and to subdue it . " but I be greatly mistaken : for I have insensibly bring myself to admire she in every thing she say or do ; and there be so much gracefulness , humility , and innocence in she whole behaviour , and I see so many melting scene between she lady and she , that I find I could not master my esteem for she . " my mother 's illness increase beyond hope of recovery , and have settle all she greater affair , she talk to I of she servants ; I ask what she would have do for and . " ' make , my dear son , as happy as you can : she be a gentlewoman bear , you know ; let she always be treat as such ; but for you own sake , do not make she independent ; for then you will want a faithful manager . yet if you marry , and you lady should not value she as she deserve , allow she a competency for the rest of she life , and let she live as she please . " 'As for , I hope you will be she protector !-- she be a good girl : I love she next to you and you dear sister . she be just arrive at a try time of life . I do not know what to say for she . what I have desig be , that if any man of a genteel calling should offer , I would give she a little pretty portion , have spare my life till then . but be she make independent , some idle fellow might snap she up ; for she be very pretty : or if she should carry what you give she to she poor parent , as she duty would lead she to do , they be so unhappily involved , that a little matter would be nothing to they , and the poor girl might be to seek again . perhaps Lady Davers will take she . but I wish she be not so pretty ! she may be the bird for which some wick fowler will spread he snare ; or , it may be , every lady will not choose to have such a waiting - maid . you be a young gentleman , and I be sorry to say , not better than I wish you to be -- though I hope my would not be in danger from she master , who owe all he servants protection , as much as the king do to he subject . yet I do not know how to wish she to stay with you , for you own reputation 's sake , my dear son ; -- for the world will censure as it list .-- would to ! ' say she , ' the dear girl have the small - pox in a mortifying manner : she would be lovly though in the genteelness of she person and the excellency of she mind ; and more out of danger of suffering from the transcient beautie of countenance . yet I think , ' add she , ' she might be safe and happy under 's care ; and if you marry , and you lady part with , let them go together , and live as they like . I think that will be the best for both . and you have a generous spirit enough : I will not direct you in the _quantum _. but , my dear son , remember that I be the less concerned , that I have not do for the poor girl myself , because I depend upon you : the manner how fitly to provide for she , have make I defer it till now , that I
I have so much more important concern on my hand ; life and strength ebbing so fast , that I be hardly fit for any thing , or to wish for any thing , but to receive the last releasing stroke . ' " here he stop , be under some concern himself , and we in much more . at last he resume the subject . " you will too naturally think , my lord -- and you , my good lady -- that the mind must be truly diabolical , that could break through the regard due to the solemn injunction of a die parent . they _did_ hold I a good while indeed ; and as fast as I find any emotion of a contrary nature rise in my breast , I endeavoure for some time to suppress they , and to think and act as I ought ; but the dear bewitch girl every day rise in she charms upon I : and find she still continue the use of she pen and ink , I could not help entertaine a jealousy , that she be write to somebody who stand well in she opinion ; and my love for she , and my own spirit of intrigue , make it a sweetheart of course . and I could not help watch she emotion ; and see she once put a letter she have just fold up , into she bosom , at my entrance into my mother 's dressing - room , I make no doubt of detect she , and she correspondent ; and so I take the letter from she stay , she trembl and curtsey with a sweet confusion : and highly pleased I be to find it contain only innocence and duty to the decease mistress , and the loving parent , express she joy that , in the midst of she grief for lose the one , she be not oblige to return to be a burden to the other ; and I give it she again , with word of encouragement , and go down much better satisfied than I have be with she correspondence . " but when I reflect upon the innocent simplicity of she style , I be still more in love with she , and form a stratagem , and succeed in it , to come at she other letter , which I send forward , after I have read they , all but three or four , which I keep back , when my plot begin to ripen for execution ; although the little slut be most abominably free with my character to she parent . " you will censure I , no doubt , that my mother 's injunction make not a more lasting impression . but really I struggle hard with myself to give they they due force : and the dear girl , as I say , every day grow lovelier , and more accomplished . she letter be but so many link to the chain in which she have bound I ; and though once I have resolve to part with she to , and you , , have a intention to take she , I could not for my life give she up ; and think more honourably than of the state of a mistress than I have do since , I could not persuade myself ( since I intend to do as handsomely by she as ever man do to a lady in that situation ) but that I should do better for she than my mother have wish I to do , and so _more_ than answer all she injunction , as to the providing for she : and I could not imagine I should meet with a resistance I have seldom encounter from person much she superior as to descent ; and be amaze at it ; for it confound I in all the notion I have of she sex , which , like a true libertine , I suppose want nothing but _importunity and _opportunity , a bold attempter , and a mind not ungenerous . sometimes I admire she for she virtue ; at other time , impetuous in my temper , and unused to control , I could have beat she . she well , I remember , describe the tumult of my soul , repeat what once pass between we , in word like , these :--'Take the little witch from I , .-- I can neither bear , nor forbear she -- but stay - you sha not go -- yet be gone !-- no , come back again .' -- she think I be mad , she say in she papers . indeed I be little less . she say , I take she arm , and grip it black and blue , to bring she back again ; and then sit down and look at she as silly as such a poor girl as she !-- well do she describe the passion I struggle with ; and no one can conceive how much my pride make I despise myself at time for the little action my love for she put I upon , and yet to find that love increase every day , as she charms and she resistance increase .-- I have catch myself in a raging fit , sometimes vow I would have she , and , at other , jealous that , to secure herself from my attempt , she would throw herself into the arm of some menial or inferior , whom otherwise she would not have think of . " sometimes I soothe , sometimes threaten she ; but never be such courage , when she virtue see in danger , mix with so much humility , when she fear give way to she hope of a juster treatment .-- then I would think it
it impossible ( so slight a opinion have I of woman 's virtue ) that such a girl as this , cottage - born , who owe every thing to my family , and have a absolute dependence upon my pleasure : myself not despicable in person or mind , as I suppose ; she unprejudice in any man 's favour , at a age susceptible of impressions , and a frame and constitution not ice or snow : ' surly , ' think I , ' all this frost must be owe to the want of fire in my attempt to thaw it : I use to dare more , and succeed better . shall such a girl as this awe I by she rigid virtue ? no , she shall not . ' " then I would resolve to be more in earnest . yet my love be a traitor , that be more faithful to _her_ than to _me ; it have more honour in it at bottom than I have design . Aw by she unaffected innocence , and a virtue I have never before encounter , so uniform and immovable , the moment I _see she I be half disarm ; and I court she consent to that , which , though I be not likely to obtain , yet it go against I to think of extort by violence . yet marriage be never in my thought : I scorne so much as to promise it . " to what numberless mean thing do not this unmanly passion subject I !-- I use to watch for she letter , though mere prittle - prattle and chit- chat , receive they with delight , though myself be accuse in they , and stigmatize as I deserv . " I would listen meanly at she chamber - door , try to overhear she little conversation ; in vain attempt to suborn to my purpose , inconsistently talk of honour , when no one step I take , or action I attempt , shew any thing like it : lose my dignity among my servants ; make a party in she favour against I , of every body , but whom my money corrupt , and that hardly sufficient to keep my partisan steady to my interest ; so greatly do the virtue of the servants triumph over the vice of the master , when confirm by such a example ! " I have be very tedious , lady and my , in my narration : but I be come within view of the point for which I now be upon my trial at you dread tribunal ( _bow to we all ) . " after several endeavour of a smooth and rough nature , in which my constantly fail I , and she good angel prevail , I have talk to to seduce the girl ( to whom , in hope of frightene she , I have give warning , but which she reject to take , to my great disappointment ) to desire to stay ; and suspect play I booty , and rather confirm she in she coyness , and she desire of leave I , I be mean enough to conceal myself in the closet in 's room , in order to hear they private conversation ; but really not design to make any other use of my concealment , than to tease she a little , if she should say any thing I do not like ; which would give I a pretence to treat she with greater freedom than I have ever yet do , and would be a introduction to take off from she unprecedented apprehensiveness another time . " but the dear prattler , not know I be there , as she undress herself , begin such a bewitch chit - chat with , who , I find , but ill keep my secret , that I never be at such a loss what to resolve upon . one while I wish myself , unknown to they , out of the closet , into which my inconsiderate passion have meanly lead I ; another time I be incense at the freedom with which I hear myself treat : but then , rigidly consider that I have no business to hearke to they private conversation , and it be such as become _them , while I ought to have be asham to give occasion for it , I excuse they both , and admire still more and more the dear prattler . " in this suspense , the undesigned rustling of my night - gown , from change my posture , alarme the watchful , she in a fright come towards the closet to see who be there . what could I then do , but bolt out upon the apprehensive charmer ; and have so do , and she run to the bed , scream to , would not any man have follow she thither , detect as I be ? but yet , I say , if she forbore she scream , I would do she no harm ; but if not , she should take the consequence . I find , by they exclamation , that this would pass with both for a attempt of the worst kind ; but really I have no such intention as they fear . when I find myself detect ; when the dear frightened girl run to the bed ; when throw herself about she ; when they would not give over they hideous squalling ; when I be charge by with the worst design ; it be enough to make I go farther than I design ; and could I have prevail upon to go up , and quiet the maid , who seem to be rise , upon the other screaming , I believe , have keep out of she
she fit , I should have be a little freer with she , than ever I have be ; but , as it be , I have no thought but of make as honourable a retreat as I could , and to save myself from be expose to my whole family : and I be not guilty of any freedom , that she modesty , unaffrighted , could reproach herself with have suffer ; and the dear creature 's fainting fit give _me_ almost as great apprehension as I could give _her_ . " thus , lady -- and , my lord -- have I tediously , and little enough to my own reputation , give you my character , and tell you more against myself than any _one_ person could accuse I of . whatever redound to the credit of my , redound in part to my own ; and so I have the less regret to accuse myself , since it exalt she . but as to a form intention to hide myself in the closet , in order to attempt the girl by violence , and in the presence of a good woman , as be , which you impute to I , bad as I be , I be not so vile , so abandoned as that . " love , as I say before , subject its inconsiderate votary to innumerable meanness , and unlawful passion to many more . I could not live without this dear girl . I hate the thought of matrimony with any body : and to be bring to the state by my mother 's wait -maid .--' forbid it , pride ! ' think I ; ' forbid it , example ! forbid it , all my past sneer , and constant ridicule , both on the estate , and on those who descende to inequality in it ! and , lastly , forbid it my family spirit , so visible in , as well as in myself , to whose insult , and those of all the world , I shall be obnoxious , if I take such a step ! ' " all this tend to demonstrate the strength of my passion : I could not conquer my love ; so I conquer a pride , which every one thought unconquerable ; and since I could not make a innocent heart vicious , I have the happiness to follow so good a example ; and by this mean , a vicious heart be become virtuous . I have the pleasure of rejoicing in the change , and hope I shall do so still more and more ; for I really view with contempt my past folly ; and it be now a greater wonder to I how I could act as I do , than that I should detest those action , which make I a curse , instead of a benefit to society . I be not yet so pious as my ; but that be to come ; and it be one good sign , that I can truly say , I delight in every instance of she piety and virtue : and now I will conclude my tedious narration . " thus he end he affect relation : which in the course of it give I a thousand different emotion ; and make I often pray for he , that will entirely convert a heart so generous and worthy , as he be on most occasion . and if I can but find he not deviate , when we go to , I shall greatly hope that nothing will affect he moral again . I have just read over again the foregoing account of himself . as near as I remember ( and my memory be the best faculty I have ) , it be pretty exact ; only he be fuller of beautiful similitude , and speak in a more flowery style , as I may say . yet do not you think , ( if I have not do injustice to he spirit ) , that the beginning of it , especially , be in the saucy air of a man too much alive to such notion ? for so the lady observ in he narration .-- be it very like the style of a true penitent ? -- but indeed he go on better , and conclude best of all . but do not you observe what a dear good lady I have ? a thousand blessing on she beloved memory ! be I to live to see my child 's child , they should be all teach to lisp she praise before they could speak . My_ gratitude should always be renew in _their_ mouth ; and , and my dear father and mother , my lady , and my master that be , my best friend that be , but principally , as most due , the first , who inspire all the rest , should have they morning , they noontide , and they evening praise , as long as I liv ! I will only observe farther , as to this my third conversation - piece , that my offer to extenuate some part of he dear brother - in - law 's conduct , which he do not himself vindicate ; and be pleased to say , that my lord be always very candid to he , and kind in he allowances for the sally of ungovernable youth . upon which my lady say , a little tartly , " yes , and for a very good reason , I doubt not ; for who care to condemn himself ? " " Nay , " say my lord pleasantly , " do not put we upon a foot , neither : for what sally I make before I know you ladyship , be but like those of
of a fox , which now and then run away with a straggling pullet , when nobody see he , whereas those of my brother be like the invasion of a lion , break into every man 's fold , and drive the shepherd , as well as the sheep , before he . " -- " ay , " say my lady , " but I can look round I , and have reason , perhaps , to think the invading lion have come off , little as he deserv it , better than the creeping fox , who , with all he cunning , sometimes suffer for he pilfering theft . " o , my dear , these gentleman be strange creature ! -- what can they think of themselves ? for they say , there be not one virtuous man in five ; but I hope , for we sex 's sake , as well as for the world 's sake , all be not true that evil fame report ; for you know every man -trespasser must _find or _make a woman - trespasser ! -- and if so , what a world be this ! -- and how must the innocent suffer from the guilty ! yet , how much better be it to suffer one 's self , than to be the cause of another 's suffering ? I long to hear of you , and must shorten my future account , or I shall do nothing but write , and tire _you_ into the bargain , though I can not my dear father and mother . I be , my dear miss , _alway yours , from to ._ . , every post you more and more oblige we to admire and love you : and let I say , I will gladly receive you letter upon you own term : only when you worthy parent have peruse they , see that I have every line of they again . you account of the arrival of you noble guest , and they behaviour to you , and yours to they ; you conversation , and wise determination , on the offer title of ; the just applause confer upon you by all , particularly the good countess ; you breakfast conversation , and the narrative of you saucy abominable _master , though amiable _husband ; all delight we beyond expression . do go on , dear excellent lady , with you charming journals , and let we know all that pass . as to the state of matter with we , I have desire my papa to allow I to decline 's address . the good man love I most violently , nay , he could not live without I : life be no life , unless I favour he : but yet , after a few more of these flight , he be try to sit down satisfied without my papa 's foolish perverse girl , as call I , and to transpose he affections to a worthier object , my sister ; and it would make you smile to see how , a little while before he _directly apply to she , she screw up she mouth to my mamma , and , truly , she would have none of 's leaving ; no , not she ! -- but no sooner do he declare himself in form , than the _gaudy wretch , as he be before with she , become a _well - dress gentleman ; -- the _chattering magpie_ ( for he talk and laugh much ) , _quite conversable , and have something _agreeable to say upon _every subject _. once he would make a good master of the buck - hound ; but now , really , the _more_ one be in he company , the _more polite one find he . then , on he part , -- he happen to see Polly first ; and truly , he could have think himself very happy in so agreeable a young lady ; yet there be always something of majesty ( what a stately name for ill nature ! ) in , something so awful ; that while engage the affections at first sight , strike a man with reverence ; insomuch , that the one might he love as a woman , but the other rever as something more : a goddess , no doubt ! I do but think , that when he come to be lift up to she celestial sphere , as she fellow constellation , what a figure and she _ursus major_ will make together ; and how will they glitter and shine to the wonder of all beholder ! then she must make a brighter appearance by far , and a more pleasing one too : for why ? she have three thousand _satellite , or little star , in she train more than poor Polly can pretend to . will not there be a fine twinkling and sparkl , think you , when the greater and lesser bear - star be join together ? but excuse I , dear ; this saucy girl have vex I just now , by she ill - natured trick ; and I be even with she , have thus vent my spite , though she know nothing of the matter . so , fancy you see abandon by she own fault ; she papa angry at she ; she mamma pity she , and call she silly girl ; , who be a rough lover , grow over he mistress , as a dog over a bone he fear to lose ; , put on she prudish pleasantry , snarl out a kind word , and break through she sullen gloom , for a smile now and then in return ; and I laugh at both in my sleeve , and think I shall
shall soon get leave to attend you in town , which will be better than twenty humble servants of 's cast : or , if I can not , that I shall have the pleasure of you correspondence here , and enjoy , unrivall , the favour of my dear parent , which this ill - tempered girl be always envy I . forgive all this nonsense . I be willing to write something , though worse than nothing , to show how desirous I be to oblige you , have I a capacity or subject , as you have . but nobody can love you better , or admire you more , of this you may be assure ( however unequal in all other respects ) , than _your_ POLLy Darnford . I send you up some of you papers for the good couple in . pray , pay my respects to they : and beg they will let I have th'ey again as soon as they can , by you conveyance . we friend desire they kindest respects ; they mention you with delight in every letter . the continue ._ Thursday , . my dear , I be return from a very busy day , have have no less than fourteen of we neighbour , gentleman and lady , to dinner : the occasion , principally , to welcome we noble guest into these part ; have , as I mention before , turn the intend visit into a entertainment , after he usual generous manner .-- he and be gone part of the way with they home ; and , mount with he favourite , as a escort to the countess and , who be take a airing in the chariot . they offer to take the coach , if I would have go ; but be fatigue , I desire to be excuse . so I retire to my closet ; and , who be seldom out of my thought , come into my mind , I have a new recruit of spirit , which enable I to resume my pen , and thus I proceed with my journal . we company be , the Earl and Countess of , who be so fashionable a marry couple , that the earl make it he boast , and he countess bear it like one accustom to such treatment , that he have not be in he lady 's company a hour abroad before for seven year . you know he lordship 's character : every body do ; and there be not a worse , as report say , in the peerage . Atkyns , a single gentleman , not a little finical and ceremonious , and a mighty beau , though of the tawdry sort , and affecte foreign air ; as if he be afraid it would not be judge by any other mark that he have travel . and he lady , a moderately happy couple , who seem always , when together , to behave as if upon a compromise ; that be , that each should take it in turn to say free thing of the other ; though some of they freedom be of so cut a nature , that it look as if they intend to divert the company at they own expense . the lady , be of a noble family , strive to let every one know that she value herself not a little upon that advantage ; but otherwise have many good quality . and he lady . he be a free joker on serious subject , but a good - natured man , and say sprightly thing with no ill grace : the lady a little reserved , and haughty , though to - day be freer than usual ; as be observe at table by , who be a maiden lady of family , note for she wit and repartee , and who say many good thing , with so little doubt and really so good a grace , that one can not help be pleased with she . this lady be generally gallant by of the , so call , to distinguish he from a rich citizen of that name , settle in these part , but be covetous and proud , be seldom admit among the gentry in they visit or party of pleasure . , one of a very courteous demeanour , a widower , be another , who always speak well of he decease lady , and of all the sex for she sake . and he lady , a well - behave couple , not asham to be very tender and observe to each other , but without that censurable fondness which sit so ill upon some marry folk in company . then there be the dean , we good minister , whom I name last , because I would close with one of the worthiest ; and he daughter , who come to supply she mamma 's place , who be indispose ; a well - behave prudent young lady . and here be we fourteen guest . the Countess of , and , , my dear . and you humble servant , make up the rest of the company . thus we have a capacious and brilliant circle ; and all the avenue to the house be crowded with they equipage . the subject of discourse at dinner be various , as you may well suppose ; and the circle be too large to fall upon any regular or very remarkable topics . a good deal of sprightly win , however , fly about , between the of , , and , in which that lord suffer as he deserv ; for he be no match for the lady , especially as the presence of the dean be a very visible restraint upon he , and too :
: so much awe will the character of a good clergyman always have upon even forward spirits , where he be know to have have a inviolable regard to it himself .-- , the good gentleman have , naturally , a genteel and inoffensive vein of raillery , and so be too hard for they at they own weapon . but after dinner , and the servant be withdraw , singl I out , as he love to do , for a subject of encomium , and make some high compliment to my dear upon he choice ; and wish ( as he often do ) , he could find just such another for himself . lady Towers tell he it be a thing as unaccountable as it be unreasonable , that every rake who love to destroy virtue , should expect to be reward with it : and if he _brother_ benefit . have come off so well , she think no one else ought to expect it . lady Davers say , it be a very just observation : and she think it a pity there be not a law , that every man who make a harlot of a honest woman , should be obliged to marry one of another 's making . say , that would be too severe ; it would be punishment enough , if he be to marry he own ; and especially if he have not seduce she under promise of marriage . " then you would have a man be obliged to stand to he promise , I suppose , B.? " reply . " yes , madam . " --" but , " say she , " the proof would be difficult perhaps : and the most unguilty heart of we sex might be least able to make it out .-- but what say you , my ; will you , and my , join to bring a bill into the house of Peers , for the purpose I mention ? I fancy my brother would give it all the assistance he could in the . " " indeed , " say , " if I may be allow to speak in the plural number , _we must not pretend to hold a argument on this subject .-- what say you , .? which side be you of ?" --" every gentleman , " reply he , " who be not of the ladie ' side , be deem a criminal ; and I be always of the side that have the power of the gallow . " " that shew , " return , " that be more afraid of the _punishment , than of deserve it . " --" ' Tis well , " say , " that any consideration deter a man of . time of life . what may be _fear_ now , may improve to _virtue_ in time . " " ay , " say , " be one of he uncle 's _fox : he would be glad to snap up a straggling pullet , if he be not well look after , perhaps . " --" pray , my dear , " say , " forbear : you ought not to introduce two different conversation into different company . " " well , but , " say , " since you seem to have be so hard put to it , as _single_ men , what be to be do with the married man who ruin a innocent body ? -- what punishment , , shall we find out for such a one ; and what reparation to the injured ? " this be say with a particular view to the earl , on a late scandalous occasion ; as I afterwards find . " as to the punishment of the gentleman , " reply , " where the law be not provide for it , it must be leave , I believe , to he conscience . it will then one day be heavy enough . but as to the reparation to the woman , so far as it can be make , it will be determinable as the unhappy person _may or may _not know , that she seducer be a married man : if she know he be , I think she neither deserve redress nor pity , though it elevate not _his_ guil . but if the case be otherwise , and _she have no means of informing herself that he be married , and he promise to make she he wife , to be sure , though _she can not be acquit , _he_ deserve the severest punishment that can be inflict .-- what say you , Mrs . B.? " " if I must speak , I think that since custom now exact so little regard to virtue from man , and so much from woman , and since the design of the former upon the latter be so flagrantly avow and know , the poor creature , who suffer herself to be seduce , either by a _single or _marry man , _with_ promise , or _without , have only to sequester herself from the world , and devote the rest of she day to penitence and obscurity . as to the gentleman , " add I , " he must , I doubt , be leave to he conscience , as you say , , which he will one day have enough to do to pacify . " " every young lady have not you angelic perfection , madam , " say . " and there be case in which the fair sex deserve compassion , ours execration . love may insensibly steal upon a soft heart ; when once admit , the oath , vow , and protestation of the favoured object , who declaim against the deceiver of he sex , confirm she good
good opinion of he , till have lull would asleep she vigilance , in a unguarded hour he take advantage of she unsuspecting innocence . be not such a poor creature to be pitie ? and what punishment do not such a seducer deserve ? " " you have put , , " say I , " a move case , and in a generous manner . what , indeed , do not such a deceiver deserve ? " --" and the more , " say , " as the most innocent heart be generally the most credulous . " -- " very true , " say my countess ; " for such a one as would do no harm to other , seldom suspect any _from other ; and she lot be very unequally cast ; admired for that very innocence which tempt some brutal ravager to ruin it . " --" yet , what be that virtue , " say the dean , " which can not stand the test ? " " but , " say , very satirically , " whither , lady , be we get ? we be upon the subject of virtue and honour . let we talk of something in which the _gentleman can join with we . this be such a one , you see , that none but the dean and can discourse upon . " --" let we then , " retort , " to be even with _one_ lady at least find a subject that will be _new to she : and that be Charity . " " do what I say concern more than any other gentleman , " return , " that he be dispose to take offence at it ? " " you must pardon I , , " say , " but I think a lady should never make a motion to wave such subject as those of virtue and honour ; and less still , in company , where there be so much occasion , as she seem to think , for enforce they . " " I desire not to wave the subject , I will assure you , " reply she . " and if , , you think it may do good , we will continue it for the sake of all you gentleman " ( look round she archly ) , " who be of opinion you may be benefite by it . " a health to the king and royal family , bring on public affair and politics ; and the lady withdraw to coffee and tea , I have no more to say as to this conversation , have repeat all that I remember be say to any purpose . Saturday morning the countess be a little indisposed . lady Davers and I take a airing this morning in the chariot , and have a long discourse together . she ladyship be pleased to express great favour and tenderness towards I ; give I much good advice , as to the care she would have I take of myself ; and tell I , that she hope , as well as she brother 's , all cent in my welfare ; and that the way I be in make she love I better and better . she be pleased to tell I , how much she approve of the domestic management ; and to say , that she never see such regularity and method in any family in she life , where be the like number of servants : every one , she say , know they duty , and do it without speak to , in such silence , and with so much apparent cheerfulness and delight , without the least hurry or confusion , that it be she surprise and admiration : but kindly would have it that I take too much care upon I . " , " say she , " I do not see but you be always fresh and lively , and never seem tired or fatigue ; and be always dress and easy , so that no company find you unprepared , or unfit to receive they , come when they will , whether it be to breakfast or dinner . " I tell she ladyship , I owe all this and most of the conduct for which she be pleased to praise I , to she dear brother , who , at the beginning of my happiness , give I several caution and instruction for my behaviour ; which have be the rule of my conduct ever since , and I hope ever would be :-- " to say nothing , " add I , " which yet would be very unjust , of the assistance I receive from worthy , who be a excellent manager . " , pamela_ , and charming girl_ , be she common word ; and she be pleased to attribute to I a graceful and unaffected ease , and that I have a natural dignity in my person and behaviour , which at once command love and reverence ; so that , my dear , I be in danger of be proud . for you must believe , that she ladyship 's approbation give I great pleasure ; and the more , as I be afraid , before she come , I should not have come on near so well in she opinion . as the chariot pass along , she take great notice of the respects pay I by people of different rank , and of the blessing bestow upon I , by several , as we proceed ; and say , she should fare well , and be rich in good wish , for be in my company . " the good people who know we , _will do so , Madam , " say I ; " but I have rather
rather have they silent prayer than they audible one ; and I have cause some of they to be tell so . what I apprehend be , that you will be more uneasy to - morrow , when at church you will see a good many people in the same way . indeed my story , and you dear brother 's tenderness to I , be so much talk of , that many stranger be bring hither to see we : ' ti the only thing , " continue I ( and so it be , ) , " that make I desirous to go to ; for by the time we return , the novelty , I hope , will cease . " then I mention some verse of , which be laid under my cushion in we seat at church , two ago , by some unknown hand ; and how uneasy they have make I . I will transcribe they , my dear , and give you the particular of we conversation on that occasion . the verse be these : " thou robb 'st my day of bus'ness and delight , of sleep thou robb 'st my night . ah ! lovely thief ! what will thou do ? what ! rob I of heaven too ? thou ev'n my prayer dost steal from I , and I , with wild idolatry , to , and end they all to thee . no , to what purpose should I speak ? no , wretch heart , swell till you break . she can not love I , if she would , and , to say truth , ' twhere pity that she should . no , to the grave thy sorrow bear , as silent as they will be there ; since that halove have hand this mortal wound do give , so handsomely the thing contrive that she may guiltless of it live ; so perish , that she kill thee a chance - medley , and no murder , be . " I have they in my pocket , and read they to my lady ; who ask I , if she brother have see they ? I tell she , it be he that find they under the cushion I use to sit upon ; but do not show they to I till I come home ; and that I be so vexed at they , that I could not go to church in the afternoon . " what should you be vex at , my dear ? " say she : " how could you help it ? my brother be not disturb at they , be he ? " --" no , indeed , " reply I : " he chide _me_ for be so ; and be pleased to make I a fine compliment upon it ; that he do not wonder that every body who see I love I . but I say , this be all that wicked wit be good for , to inspire such boldness in bad heart , which might otherwise not dare to set pen to paper to affront any one . but pray , madam , " add I , " do not own I have tell you of they , lest the least shadow of a thought should arise , that I be prompt by some vile secret vanity , to tell you ladyship of they , when I be sure , they have vex I more than enough . for be it not a sad thing , that the church should be profan by such action , and such thought , as ought not to be bring into it ? then , , to have any wicked man _dare to think of one with impure notion ! it give I the less opinion of myself , that I should be so much as _thotch of as the object of any wicked body 's wish . I have call myself to account upon it , whether any levity in my look , my dress , my appearance , could embole such a offensive insolence . and I have think upon this occasion better of 's delicacy than I do , when I read of it ; who , upon a attempt make on he wife , to which , however , it do not appear she give the least encouragement , say to those who plead for she against the divorce he be resolve upon , _that the wife of ought not to be suspect _.-- indeed , , " continue I , " it would extremely shock I , but to know that any wicked heart have conceive a design upon I ; upon _me_ , give I leave to repeat , whose only glory and merit be , that I have have the grace to withstand the greatest of trials and temptation , from a gentleman more worthy to be belove , both for person and mind , than any man in . " " you observation , my dear , be truly delicate , and such as become you mind and character . and I really think , if any lady in the world be secure from vile attempt , it must be you ; not only from you story , so well know , and the love you bear to you man , and he merit to you , but from the prudence , and natural _dignity , I will say , of you behaviour , which , though easy and cheerful , be what would strike dead the hope of any presumptuous libertine the moment he see you . " " how can I enough , " return I , and kiss she hand , " acknowledge you ladyship 's polite goodness in this compliment ? but , my lady , you see by the very instance I
I have mention , that a liberty be take , which I can not think of without pain . " " I be pleased with you delicacy , my dear , as I say before . you can never err , whilst thus watchful over you conduct : and I own you have the more reason for it , as you have marry a mere , a open - eye rake " ( that be she word ) , " who would , on the least surmise , though ever so causeless on you part , have all he passion up in arm , in fear of libertie be offer like those he have not scruple to take . " --" o but , Madam , " say I , " he have give I great satisfaction in one point ; for you must think I should not love he as I ought , if I have not a concern for he future happiness , as well as for he present ; and that be , he have assure I , that in all the libertie he have take , he never attempt a married lady , but always abhor the thought of so great a evil . " --" t'Tis pity , " say she ladyship , " that a man who could conquer he passion _so far , could not subdue they entirely . this shew it be in he own power to do so ; and increase he crime : and what a wretch be he , who scrupl , under pretence of conscience or honour , to attempt lady _within_ the pale , boggle not to ruin a poor creature _without ; although he know , he thereby , most probably , for ever deprive she of that protection , by prevent she marriage , which even among such rake as himself , be deem , he own , inviolable ; and so cast the poor creature headlong into the jaw of perdition . " " ah ! madam , " reply I , " this be the very inference I make upon the occasion . " -- " and what could he say ? " --" he say , my inference be just ; but call I _pretty preacher _;--and once have caution I not to be over -serious to he , so as to cast a gloom , as he say , over we innocent enjoyment , I never dare to urge matter farther , when he call I by that name . " " well , " say my lady , " thou 'rt a admirable girl ! 's goodness be great to we family , when it give thee to it . no wonder , " continue she , " as my brother say , every body that see you , and have hear you character , love you . and this be some excuse for the inconsiderate folly even of this unknown transcriber . " -- " ah ! madam , " reply I , " but be it not a sad thing , that people , if they must take upon they to like one 's behaviour in general , should have the _worst , instead of the _best_ thought upon it ? if I be as good as I _otch to be , and as some _think_ I , must they wish to make I bad for that reason ? " she ladyship be pleased to kiss I as we sit . " my charme , my _more than sister , _. " --( do she say ?)--yes , she do say so ! and make my eye overflow with joy to hear the sweet epithet . " how you conversation charm I !-- I charge you , when you get to town , let I have you remark on the diversion you will be carry to by my brother . now I know what to expect from _you , and you know how acceptable every thing from you will be _to me_, I promise great pleasure , as well to myself as to my worthy friend , particularly to , in you unrestrained free correspondence .-- indeed , , I must bring you acquaint with : she be one of the worthy of we sex , and have a fine understanding .-- I be sure you will like she .-- but ( for the world say it not to my brother , nor let know I tell you so , if ever you should be acquaint ) I have carry the matter so far by my officious zeal to have my brother marry to so fine a lady , not doubt he joyful approbation , that it be no small disappointment to _her , when he marry you : and this be the best excuse I can make for my furious behaviour to you at the Hall . for though I be naturally very hasty and passionate , yet then I be almost mad .-- indeed my disappointment have give I so much indignation both against you and he , that it be well I do not do some violent thing by you . I believe you do feel the weight of my hand : but what be that ? ' Twas well I do not _kill you dead _. " -- these be she ladyship 's word --" for how could I think the wild libertine capable of be engage by such noble motive , or thee what thou be !-- so this will account to thee a little for my violence then . " " you ladyship , " say I , " all these thing consider , have but too much reason to be angry at you dear brother 's proceedings , so well as you always love he , so high a concern as you always have to promote he honour and interest , and
and so far as you have go with . " " I tell thee , , that the old story of and run in my head all the way of my journey , and I almost wish for a potion to force down thy throat : when I find thy lewd paramour absent , ( for little do I think thou wast marry to he , though I expect thou wouldst try to persuade I to believe it ) fear that he intrigue with thee would effectually frustrate my hope as to and he : ' now , ' think I , ' all happen as I wish ! -- now will I confro not this brazen girl ! -- now will I try she innocence , as I please , by offer to take she away with I ; if she refuse , take that refusal for a demonstration of she guilt ; and then ,' think I , 'I will make the creature provoke I , in the presence of my nephew and my woman , ' ( and I hope to have get that woman Jewkes to testify for I too ) , and I can not tell what I might have do , if thou hadst not escape out of the window , especially after tell I thou wast as much marry as I be , and hadst shew I he tender letter to thee , which have a quite different effect upon I than you expect . but if I have commit any act of violence , what remorse should I have have on reflection , and know what a excellence I have injure ! thank God thou didst escape I ! " and then she ladyship fold she arm about I , and kiss I . this be a sad story , you will say , my dear : and I wonder what she ladyship 's passion would have make she do ! surely she would not have _kill I dead ! surely she would not !-- let it not , however , -- nor you , my dear parent -- when you see it -- go out of you own hand , nor be read , for my 's sake , to any body else -- no , not to you own mamma . it make I tremble a little , even at this distance , to think what a sad thing passion be , when way be give to its ungovernable tumult , and how it deform and debase the noblest mind . we return from this agreeable airing just in time to dress before dinner , and then my lady and I go together into the countess 's apartment , where I receive abundance of compliment from both . as this brief conversation will give you some notion of that management and economy for which they heape upon I they kind praise , I will recite to you what pass in it , and hope you will not think I too vain ; and the less , because what I undergo formerly from my lady 's indignation , half entitle I to be proud of she present kindness and favour . lady Davers say , " you ladyship must excuse we , that we have lose so much of you company ; but here , this sweet girl have so entertaine I , that I could have stay out with she all day ; and several time do I bid the coachman prolong he circuit . " --" my good , , " say I , " have give I inexpressible pleasure , and have be all condescension and favour , and make I as proud as proud can be ." --" you , my dear , " say she , " may have give great pleasure to , for it can not be otherwise -- but I have no great notion of she ladyship 's condescension , as you call it --( pardon I , Madam , " say she to she , smile ) " when she can not raise she style above the word _girl , come off from a tour you have make so delightful to she . " --" I protest to you , my , " reply she ladyship , with great goodness , " that word , which once I use through pride , as you will call it , I now use for a very different reason . I begin to doubt , whether to call she _sister , be not more honour to myself than to she ; and to this hour be not quite convinc ' . when I be , I will call she so with pleasure . " I be quite overcome with this fine compliment , but could not answer a word : and the countess say , " I could have spare you longer , have not the time of day compelle you return ; for I have be very agreeably entertained , as well as you , although but with the talk of you woman and mine . for here they have be give I such a account of . . 's economy , and family management , as have highly deligh I . I never know the like ; and in so young a lady too .-- we shall have strange reformation to make in we family , , when we go home , be we to follow so good a example .-- why , my dear , " continue she ladyship , " you out - do all you neighbour . and indeed I be glad I live so far from you :-- for be I to try to imitate you , it would still be _but_ imitation , and you would have the honour of it . " --" yet you hear , and you see by yesterday 's conversation , " say ,
, " how much she best neighbour , of both sex , admire she : they all yield to she the palm , unenvying . " --" then , my good lady , " say I , " it be a sign I have most excellent neighbour , full of generosity , and willing to encourage a young person in do right thing : so it make , consider what I be , more for they honour than my own . for what censure should not such a one as I deserve , who have not be educate to fill up my time like lady of condition , be I not to employ myself as I do ? I , who have so little other merit , and who bring no fortune at all . " -- " come , come , , none of you self - deny ordinance , " that be 's word ; " you must know something of you own excellence : if you do not , I will tell it you , because there be no fear you will be proud or vain upon it . I do not see , then , that there be the lady in yours , or any neighbourhood , that behave with more decorum , or better keep up the part of a lady , than you do . how you manage it , I can not tell ; but you do as much by a look , and a pleasant one too , that be the rarity ! as I do by high word , and passionate exclamation : I have often nothing but blunder upon blunder , as if the wretch be in a confederacy to try my patience . " -- " perhaps , " say I , " the awe they have of you ladyship , because of you high quality , make they commit blunder ; for I myself be always more afraid of appear before you ladyship , when you have visit you honoured mother , than of any body else , and have be the more sensibly awkward through that very awful respect . " -- " , , , that be not it : ' ti all in yourself . I use to think my mamma , and my brother too , have as awkward servants as ever I see any where -- except -- well enough for a bachelor , indeed !-- but , here !-- thou hast not part with one servant -- Hast thou ? " -- " no , . " --" how ! " say the countess ; " what excellence be here !-- all of they , pardon I , , you fellow - servants , as one may say , and all of they so respectful , so watchful of you eye ; and you , at the same time , so gentle to they , so easy , so cheerful . " do not you think I , my dear , insufferably vain ? but ' tis what they be pleased to say . ' Tbe they goodness to I , and shew how much they can excel in generous politeness . so I will proceed . " why this , " continue the countess , " must be _born_ dignity --_born_ discretion -- education can not give it :-- if it could , why should not _we_ have it ? " the lady say many more kind thing of I then ; and after dinner they mention all over again , with additions , before my best friend , who be kindly delighted with the encomium give I by two lady of such distinguishing judgment in all other case . they tell he , how much they admire my family management : then they would have it that my genius be universal , for the employment and accomplishment of my sex , whether they consider it as employ in penmanship , in needlework , in pay or receive visit , in music , and I can not tell how many other qualifications , which they be pleased to attribute to I , over and above the family management : say , that I have a understanding which comprehend every thing , and a eye that penetrat into the very bottom of matter in a moment , and never be at a loss for the _should be , the _why or _wherefore , and the _how _-- these be they comprehensive word ; that I do every thing with celerity , clear all as I go , and leave nothing , they observe , to come over again , that could be dispatch at once : by which mean , they say , every hand be clear to undertake a new work , as well as my own head to direct it ; and there be no hurry nor confusion : but every come hour be fresh and ready , and unincumbered ( so they say ) , for its new employment ; and to this they attribute that ease and pleasure with which every thing be perform , and that I could _do_ and _cause to be do , so much business without hurry either to myself or servants . judge how please this be to my best belove , who find , in they kind approbation , such a justification of he own conduct as could not fail of be pleasing to he , especially as be one of the kind praiser . be so highly delighted , that he rise once , begge he brother 's excuse , to salute I , and stand over my chair , with a pleasure in he look that can not be express , now - and - then lift up he hand , and he good - natured eye glisten with joy , which a pier - glass give I the opportunity of
of see , as sometimes I steal a bashful glance towards it , not know how or which way to look . even seem to be touch very sensibly ; and recollect he behaviour to I at the hall , he once cry out , " what a sad whelp be _I_ , to behave as I formerly do , to so much excellence ! -- not , , that I be any thing uncivil neither ; -- but in unworthy sneer , and nonsense .-- you know I well enough . -- you call I , _tinsell would boy , though , , do not you remember that ? and say , _twenty or thirty year hence , when I be at age , you would give I a answer ._ ! I shall never forget you look , nor you word neither !-- they be severe speech , be they not , ? " --" o you see , , " reply my dear , " be not quite perfect . we must not provoke she ; for she will call we both so , perhaps ; for I wear a laced coat , sometimes , as well as you . " " Nay , I can not be angry , " say he . " I deserve it richly , that I do , have it be worse . " --" thy silly tongue , " say my lady , " run on without fear or wit . what be past be past . " --" why , Madam , I be plaguily wrong ; and I say nothing of any body but _myself _:-- and have be ready to hang myself since , as often as I have think of my nonsense . " --" my nephew , " say my lord , " must bring in hang , or the gallow in every speech he make , or it will not be he . " , smile , say , with severity enough in he meaning , as I see by the turn of he countenance , " know that he birth and family entitle he more to the _block , than the rope , or he would not make so free with the latter . " --" good ! very good , by ! " say laugh . the countess smile . lady Davers shook she head at she brother , and say to she nephew , " thou 'rt a good - natured foolish fellow , that thou art . " --" for what , ? why the word _foolish , aunt ? what have I say now ? " " nothing to any purpose , indeed , " say she ; " when thou dost , I will write it down . " --" then , , " say he , " have you pen and ink always about you , when I be present ; and put that down to begin with ! " this make every one laugh . " what a happy thing be it , " think I , " that good nature generally accompany this character ; else , how would some people be supportable ? " but here I will break off . ' tTis time , you will say . but you know to whom I write , as well as to yourself , and they will be pleased with all my silly scribble . so excuse one part for that , and another for friendship 's sake , and then I shall be wholly excusable to you . now the trifler again resume she pen . I be in some pain , , for to - morrow , because of the rule we observe of late in we family on , and of go through a crowd to church ; which will afford new scene to we noble visitor , either for censure or otherwise : but I will sooner be censured for do what I think my duty , than for the want of it ; and so will omit nothing that we have be accustom to do . I hope I shall not be think ridiculous , or as one who aim at work of supererogation , for what I think be very short of my duty . some order , surely , become the head of family ; and besides , it would be discredite one 's own practice , if one do not appear at one time what one do at another . for that which be a reason for discontinue a practice for some company , would seem to be a reason for lay it aside for ever , especially in a family visit and visit as ours . and I remember well a hint give I by my dearest friend once on another subject , that it be in every one 's power to prescribe rule to himself , after a while , and person to see what be one 's way , and that one be not to be put out of it . but my only doubt be , that to lady , who have not be accustom perhaps to the _necessary strictness , I should make myself censurable , as if I aim at too much perfection : for , however one 's duty be one 's duty , and ought not to be dispense with ; yet , when a person , who use to be remiss , see so hard a task before they , and so many great point to get over , all to be no more than tolerably regular , it be rather apt to frighten and discourage , than to allure ; and one must proceed , as I have read soldier do , in a difficult siege , inch by inch , and be more studious to entrench and fortify themselves , as they go on gain upon the
the enemy , than by rush all at once upon a attack of the place , be repulse , and perhaps oblige with great loss to abandon a hopeful enterprise . and permit I to add , that young as I be , I have often observed , that over -great strictness all at once enjoin and insist upon , be not fit for a beginning reformation , but for stronger only ; and therefore generally do more harm than good . but shall I not be too grave , my dear friend ?-- excuse I ; for this be night : and as it be a very good method which the ingenious author of the Spectator take , generally to treat they more serious subject on this day ; so I think one should , when one can , consider it as the preparative eve to a still better . sunday . now , my dear , by what I have already write , it be become in a manner necessary to acquaint you briefly with the method my dear . not only permit , but encourage I to take , in the family he leave to my care , as to the _duty . the worthy dean , at my request , and my beloved 's permission , recommend to I , as a sort of family chaplain , for , a young gentleman of great sobriety and piety , and sound principle , who have but lately take order , have at present no other provision . and this gentleman come , and read prayer to we about seven in the morning , in the lesser hall , as we call it , a retired apartment , next the little garden ; for we have no chapel with we here , as in you neighbourhood ; and this generally , with some suitable exhortation , or meditation out of some good book , which he be so kind as to let I choose now - and - then , when I please , take up little more than half a hour . we have a great number of servants of both sex : and myself , , and , be generally in a little closet , which , when we open the door , be but just a separation from the hall .-- ( for that be we young clergyman 's name ) have a desk at which sometimes make up he run account to , who be very scrupulous of admit any body to the use of he office , because of the writing in he custody , and the order he value himself upon have every thing in . about seven in the evening he come again , and I generally , let I have what company I will , find time to retire for about another half hour ; and my dear connive at , and excuse my absence , if enquire after ; though for so short a time , I be seldom miss . to the young gentleman I shall present , every quarter , five guinea , and press he to accept of a place at he table at he pleasure : but , as we have generally much company , he modesty make he decline it , especially at those time .-- join with we very often in we office , and seldom miss : and they tell Jervis that they can not express the pleasure they have to meet I there ; and the edification they receive . my best belove dispense as much as he can with the servants , for the evening part , if he have company ; or will be attend only by or , perhaps by turn ; and sometimes look upon he watch , and say , " ' Tis near seven ; " and if he say so , they take it for a hint that they may be dispense with for half a hour ; and this countenance which he give I , have contribute not a little to make the matter easy and delightful to I , and to every one .-- when I part from they , on the breaking up of we assembly , they generally make a little row on each side of the hall - door ; and when I have make my compliment , and pay my thanks to , they whisper , as I go out , " bless you , madam ! " and bow and curtsey with such pleasure in they honest countenance as greatly delights I : and I say , " so my good friend -- I be glad to see you -- not one absent ! " or but one --( as it fall out ) -- " this be very obliging , " I cry : and thus I show they , that I take notice , if any body be not there . and back again I go to pay my duty to my earthly benefactor : and he be pleased to say sometimes , that I come to he with such a radiance in my countenance , as give he double pleasure to behold I ; and often tell I , that but for appear too fond before company , he could meet I as I enter , with embrace as pure as my own heart . I hope in time , I shall prevail upon the dear man to give I he company .-- but , thank God , I be enable to go thus far already !-- I will leave the rest to he providence . for I have a point very delicate to touch upon in this particular ; and I must take care not to lose the ground I have gain , by too precipitately push at too much at once . this be my comfort , that next to be uniform _himself
_himself , be that permission and encouragement he give _me_ to be so , and he pleasure in see I so delighted -- and besides , he always give I he company to church . of how happy should I think myself , if he would be pleased to accompany I to the divine office , which yet he have not do , though I have urge he as much as I durst .-- ask I on evening , if I would be concerned to see a larger congregation in the lesser hall next morn than usual ? I answer , " no , by no means . " she say , , and ( the two lady ' woman ) , and , my 's gentleman , and . servant , and the coachman and footman belong to we noble visitor , who be , she say , all great admirer of we family management and good order , have be tell we method , beg to join in it . I know I should be a little dashed at so large a company ; but the man be orderly for lord 's servants , and assure I that they be very earnest in they request , I consent to it . when , at the usual time , ( with my ) I go down , I find here ( to whom I make my first compliment ) , and every one of we own people wait for I , accept ( whom . have keep up late the night before ) , together with and , and , with the servants of we guest , who , as also worthy , and , and , pay I they respects : and I say , " this be early rise , and ; you be very kind to countenance we with you company in this we family order . , I be glad to see you .-- how do you do , ? " and look round with complacency on the servants of we noble visitor . and then I lead and to my little retiring place , and and my Polly follow ; and throw the door open , begin some select prayer ; and as he read with great emphasis and propriety , as if he heart be in what he read , all the good folk be exceedingly attentive .-- after prayer , read a meditation , from a collection make for private use , which I shall more particularly mention by - and - by ; and end with the usual benediction , I thank the worthy gentleman , and gently chide he in . name , for he modesty in decline we table ; and thank , , and , receive they kind wish , and hasten , blush through they praise , to my chamber , where , be alone , I pursue the subject for a hour , till breakfast be ready , when I attend the lady , and my best belove , who have tell they of the verse place under my cushion at church . -- we set out , my and , and myself , and in we coach , and . and the countess in the chariot ; both lady and the gentleman splendidly dress ; but I avoid a glitter as much as I could , that I might not seem to vie with the two peeress .-- say , " why be you not full - dress , my dear ? " I say , I hope he would not be displease ; if he be , I would do as he command . he kindly answer , " as you like best , my love . you be charme in every dress . " the chariot first draw up to the church door , . lead the countess into church . my do I that honour ; and hand he aunt through a crowd of gazer , many of whom , as usual , be stranger . the neighbour gentleman and they lady pay we they silent respects ; but the thought of the wicked verse , or rather , as Lady Davers will have I say , wick action of the transcriber of they , make I keep behind the pew ; but my lady sit down by I , and whisperingly talk between whiles , to I , with great tenderness and freedom in she aspect ; which I could not but take kindly , because I know she intend by it , to show every one she be pleased with I . afterwards she be pleased to add , take my hand , and . and the countess hear she ( for she raise she voice to a more audible whisper ) , " I be proud to be in thy company , and in this solemn place , I take thy hand , and acknowledge with pride , my _sister _. " I look down ; and indeed , at church , I can hardly at any time look up ; for who can bear to be gaze at so ?-- and softly say , " oh ! my good lady ! how much you honour I ; the place , and these surround eye , can only hinder I from acknowledging as I ink . " my best friend , with pleasure in he eyes , say , press he hand upon both ours , as my lady have mine in hers -- " you be two beloved creature : both excellent in you way . bless you both . " --" and you too , my dear brother , " say my lady . the countess whisper , " you should spare a body a little ! you give one , lady , and , too much pleasure all at once . such company , and such behaviour
behaviour add still more charms to devotion ; and be I to be here a twelvemonth , I would never miss once accompany you to this good place . " . think he must say something , and address himself to he noble uncle , who could not keep he good - natured eye off I --" I will be _hang have , my lord , if I know how to behave myself ! why this outdo the chapel !-- I be glad I put on my new suit ! " and then he look upon himself , as if he would support , as well as he could , he part of the general admiration . but think you not , my dear , and my dearest father and mother , that I be now in the height of my happiness in this life , thus favour by ? the dean preach a excellent sermon ; but I need not have say that ; only to have mention , that _he_ preach , be say enough . my lord lead I out when divine service be over ; and be a little tender in he foot , from a gouty notice , walk very slowly . lady Towers and join we in the porch , and make we they compliment , as do . " will you favour we with you company home , my old acquaintance ? " say to he .--" I can not , have a gentleman , my relation , to dine with I ; but if it will be agreeable in the evening , I will bring he with I to taste of you Burgundy : for we have not any such in the county . " --" I shall be glad to see you , or any friend of yours , " reply . whisper -- " it be more , however , to admire you lady , I can tell you that , than you wine . - get into you coach , lady , " say he , with he usual freedom ; " we maiden and widow lady have a fine time of it , wherever you come : by my faith they must every one of they quit this neighbourhood , if you be to stay in it : but all they hope be , that while you be in , they will have the game in they own hand . " --" _Sister , " say , most kindly to I , in presence of many , who ( in a respectful manner ) gather near we , " be the same gentleman he use to be , I see . " " , , " say I , smile , " have but one fault : he be too apt to praise whom he favour , at the expense of he absent friend . " " I be always proud of you reproof , , " reply he .-" ay , " say , " that I believe .-- and , therefore , I wish , for all we sake , you would take he oftener to task , . " lady Towers , , , and , all claim visit from we ; and make excuse , that he must husband he time , be oblige to go to town soon , propose to breakfast with the next morning , dine with , and sup with Brooks ; and as there can not be a more social and agreeable neighbourhood any where , he proposal , after some difficulty , be accept ; and we usual visiting neighbours be all to have notice accordingly , at each of the place . I see come towards we , and fear to be stifle with compliment , I say -- " you servant , lady and gentleman ; " and give my hand to , steep into the chariot , instead of the coach ; for people that would avoid bustle , sometimes make it . find my mistake , I would have come out , but my lord say , " indeed you not : for I will step in , and have you all to myself . " lady Davers smile -- " now , " say she ( while the coach draw up ) , " be my please ; -- but I see , sister , you be tired with part of you company in the coach . " --" 'Tis well contrive , my dear , " say , " as long as you have not deprive I of this honour ; " take the countess 's hand , and lead she into the coach . will you excuse all this impertinence , my dear ?-- I know my father and mother will be pleased with it ; and you will therefore bear with I ; for they kind heart will be delighted to hear every minute thing in relation to and myself .-- when come in the evening , with he friend ( who be , a polite young gentleman of ) , he tell we of the praise lavish away upon I by several genteel stranger ; one say to he friend , he have travel twenty mile to see I .-- my be praise too for she goodness to I , and the gracefulness of she person ; the countess for the noble serenity of she aspect , and that charme ease and freedom , which distinguished she birth and quality . my dear , he say , be greatly admire too : but he would not make _him_ proud ; for he have superiority enough already , that be he word , over he neighbour : " but I can tell you , " say he , " that for most of you praise you be oblige to you lady , and for have reward she excellence as you have
have do : for one gentleman , " add he , " say , he know no one but _you_ could deserve she ; and he believe _you_ do , from that tenderness in you behaviour to she , and from that grandeur of air , and majesty of person , that seem to show you form for she protector , as well as rewarder .-- get you go to , both of you , " say he . " I do not intend to tell you , , what be say of you . " the woman of the two lady have acquaint they ladyship with the order I observe for the day , and the devout behaviour of the servants . and about seven , I withdraw as silently and as unobserved as I could , be surprised , as I be go through the great hall , to be join by both . " I shall come at all you secret , , " say my lady , " and be able , in time , to cut you out in you own way . I know whither you be go . " " my good lady , " say I , " pardon I for leave you . I will attend you in half a hour . " " no , my dear , " say , " the countess and I have resolve to attend you for that half hour , and we will return to company together . " " be it not descend too much , my lady , as to the company ? " --" if it be for we , it be for you , " say the countess ; " so we will either act up to you , or make you come down to we ; and we will judge of all you proceedings . " every one , but ( who attend the gentleman ) , and all they ladyship 's servants , and they two woman , were there ; which please I , however , because it shew , that even the stranger , by this they second voluntary attendance , have no ill opinion of the service . but they be all start , ours and theirs , to see the lady accompany I . I steep up to .--" I be in hope . , " say I , " we should have be favour with you company at we table . " he bow .-- " well , , " say I , " these lady come to be oblige to you for you good office ; and you will have no better way of letting they return they obligation , than to sup , though you would not dine with they . " -- " , " say my lady , " how do you do ?-- we be come to be witness of the family decorum ." -- " we have a blessed lady , Madam , " say he : " and you ladyship 's presence augment we joy . " I should have say , we be not at church in the afternoon ; and when I do not go , we have the evening service read to we , as it be at church ; which perform now , with he usual distinctness and fervour . when all be conclude , I say , " now , my dearest lady , excuse I for the sake of the delight I take in see all my good folk about I in this decent and oblige manner .-- indeed , I have no ostentation in it , if I know my own heart . " the countess and Lady Davers , delighte to see such good behaviour in every one , sit a moment or two look upon one another in silence ; and then my take my hand : " , deservedly belove of the kindest of husband , what a bless art thout to this family ! " --" and to every family , " say the countess , " who have the happiness to know , and the grace to follow , she example ! " --" but where , " say , " collectedst thou all this good sense , and fine spirit in thy devotion ? " --" the , " say I , " be the foundation of all . " -- then turn herself to --" how do you , good woman ? " say she . " why you be now make ample amend for the love you bear to this dear creature formerly . " " you have a angel , and not a woman , for you lady , my good , " say the countess . , fold she uplift hand together --" of my good lady , you know not we happiness ; no , not one half of it . we be before bless with plenty , and a bountiful indulgence , by we good master ; but we plenty bring on wantonness and wrangling : but now we have peace as well as plenty ; and peace of mind , my dear lady , in do all in we respective power , to show ourselves thankful creature to , and to the best of master and mistress . " " good soul ! " say I , and be force to put my handkerchief to my eye : " you heart be always overflowe thus with gratitude and praise , for what you so well merit from we . " " , " say my lady , assume a sprightly air , although she eye twinkle , to keep within its lid the precious water , that spring from a noble and well - affect heart , " I be glad to see you here , attend you pious young lady .-- well might you love she
she , honest man !-- I do not know there be so excellent a creature in any rank . " " madam , " say the other worthy heart , unable to speak but in broken sentence , " you do not know -- indeed you do not , what a -- what a -- hap -- happy -- family we be !-- truly , we be like unto 's soldier , every one fit to be a general ; so well do we all know we duty , and _practise_ they too , let I say .-- , and please you ladyship , we all of we long till morning come , thus to attend my lady ; and after that be past , we long for evening , for the same purpose : for she be so good to we -- you can not think how good she be ! but permit you honoured father 's old servant to say one word more , that though we be always pleased and joyful on these occasion ; yet we be in transport to see we master 's noble sister thus favour we -- with you ladyship too , " ( to the countess ) -- " and approve we young lady 's conduct and piety . " " Blesse on you all ! " say my lady . " let we go , my lady ; -- let we go , sister , for I can not stop any longer ! " as I slid by , follow they ladyship -- " how do you , ? " say I softly : " I fear you be not well in the morning . " he bow -- " pardon I , Madam -- I be leetel indispose , that ish true ! " now , my dear friend , will you forgive I all this self - praise , as it may seem ?-- yet when you know I give it you , and my dear parent , as so many instance of my 's reconciliation and goodness to I , and as it will show what a noble heart she have at bottom , when she pride of quality and she passion have subside , and she native good sense and excellence take place , I flatter myself , I may be the rather excuse ; and especially , as I hope to have you company and countenance one day , in this my delightful employment . I should have add , for I think a good clergyman can not be too much respect , that I repeat my request to , to oblige we with he company at supper ; but he so very earnestly beg to be excuse , and with so much concern of countenance , that I think it would be wrong to insist upon it ; though I be sorry for it , sure as I be that modesty be always a sign of merit . we return to the gentleman when supper be ready , as cheerful and easy , Lady Davers observe , as if we have not be present at so solemn a service . " and this , " say she , after they be go , " make religion so pleasant and delightful a thing , that I profess I shall have a much higher opinion of those who make it a regular and constant part of they employment , than ever I have . " " then , " say she , " I be once , I remember , when a girl , at the house of a very devout man , for a week , with he granddaughter , my school - fellow ; and there be such preachment _against vanity , and _for self - denial , that be we to have follow the good man 's precept , ( though indeed not he practice , for well do he love he belly ) , half 's creature and work would have be useless , and industry would have be banish the earth . " then , " add she ladyship , " have I hear the good man confess himself guilty of such sins , as , if true ( and by he hide he face with he broad - brim hat , it look a little bad against he ) , he ought to have be hang on a gallow fifty foot high . " these reflection , as I say , fall from my lady , after the gentleman be go , when she recount to she brother , the entertainment , as she be pleased to call it , I have give she . on which she make high encomium , as do the countess ; and they praise also the natural dignity which they impute to I , say , I have teach they a way they never could have find out , to descmend to the company of servants , and yet to secure , and even augment , the respect and veneration of inferior at the same time . " and , , " say my lady , " you be certainly very right to pay so much regard to the young clergyman ; for that make all he read , and all he say , of greater efficacy with the auditor , facilitate the work you have in view to bring about , and in you own absence ( for you monarch may not always dispense with you , perhaps ) strengthen he influence , and encourage he , beside . " Monday . I be to thank you , my dear , for you kind letter , approve of my scribble . when you come to my 's and 's account , I shall try you patience . but no more of that ; for as you can read they , or let they alone ,
, I be the less concerned , especially as they will be more indulgently receive somewhere else , than they may merit ; so that my labour will not be wholly lose . I congratulate you with all my heart on you dismissing ; I could not help shew you letter to . and what do you think the free gentleman say upon it ? I be half afraid to tell you : but do , now you be so happily disengage , get leave to come , and let we two contrive to be even with he for it . you be the only lady in the world that I would join with against he . he say , that you character of and , which he call severe ( but I will not call they so , without you leave ) , look a little like petty spite , and as if you be sorry the gentleman take you at you word . that be what he say -- pray let we punish he for it . yet , he call you charme lady , and say much in you praise , and join with I , that , who be so easy to part with you , could not possibly deserve you . " but , , " say he , " I know the sex well enough . Polly may not love ; yet , to see she sister address and compliment , and prefer to herself , by one whom she so lately think she could choose or refuse , be a mortifying thing .-- and young lady can not bear to sit by neglect , while two lover be play pug 's trick with each other . " then , " say he , " all the preparations to matrimony , the clothes to be buy , the visit to be pay and receive , the compliment of friend , the busy novelty of the thing , the day to be fix , and all the little foolish humour and nonsense attend a conclude courtship , when _one sister_ be to engross all the attention and regard , the new equipage , and so forth ; these be all subject of mortification to the _other , though she have no great value for the man perhaps . " " well , but , , " say I , " a lady of 's good sense , and good taste , be not to be affect by these parade , and have well consider the matter , no doubt ; and I dare say , rejoice , rather than repine , at miss the gentleman . " I hope you will leave the happy pair ( for they be so , if they think themselves so ) together , and to rejoice in he accomplished son - in - law elect , and give we you company to . for who would stay to be vex by that ill - nature , as you own you be , at you last writing ? -- but I will proceed , and the rather , as I have something to tell you of a conversation , the result of which have do I great honour , and give inexpressible delight ; of which in its place . we pursue . proposal , return several visit in one day ; for we have so polite and agreeable a neighbourhood , that all seem desirous to accommodate each other . we come not home till ten in the evening , and then find a letter from , uncle by the half blood to , acquaint he , that hear he niece , , be with he , he would be here in a day or two ( be then upon he journey ) to pay a visit to both at the same time . this gentleman be very particularly odd and humoursome : and he eldest son be next heir to the maternal estate , if should have no child , be exceedingly dissatisfied with he debasing himself in marry I ; and would have be better please have he not marry at all , perhaps . there never be any cordial love between . father and he , nor between the uncle , and nephew and niece : for he positiveness , roughness , and self - interestedness too , have make he , though very rich , but little agreeable to the generous temper of he nephew and niece ; yet when they meet , which be not above once in four or five year , they be very civil and oblige to he . lady Davers wonder what could bring he hither now : for he live in , and seldom stirs ten mile from home . say , he be sure it be not to compliment he and I on we nuptial . " no , rather , " say my lady , " to satisfy himself if you be in a way to cut out he own cub . " --" thank , we be , " say he . " whenever I be strongest set against matrimony , the only reason I have to weigh against my dislike to it be , that I be unwilling to leave so large a part of my estate to that family . my dear , " say he to I , " do not be uneasy ; but you will see a relation of mine much more disagreeable than you can imagine ; but no doubt you have hear he character . " " ah , , " say , " we be a family that value ourselves upon we ancestry ; but , upon my word , , and all he line , have nothing else to boast off . and I have be often asham of my relation to they . " -- " no
no family , I believe , my lady , have every body excellent in it , " reply I : " but I doubt I shall stand but poorly with . " " he will not dare to affro not you , my dear , " say , " although he will say to you , and to I , and to my sister too , blunt and rough thing . but he will not stay above a day or two , and we shall not see he again for some year to come ; so we will bear with he . " I be now , , come to the conversation I hint at . Tuesday . on , come to pay he respects to he kind patron . I have be to visit a widow gentlewoman , and , on my return , go directly to my closet , so know not of he be here till I come to dinner ; for . and he be near two hour in discourse in the library . when I come down , present he to I . " my friend , my dear , " say he . " , how do you do ? " say I ; " I be glad to see you . " he rejoice , he say , to see I look so well ; and have longe for a opportunity to pay he respects to he worthy patron and I before : but have be prevent twice when upon the point of set out . say , " I have prevail upon my old acquaintance to reside with we , while he stay in these part . do you , my dear , see that every thing be make agreeable to he . " -- " to be sure , , I will . " be in the house , . send to desire he would dine with we : if it be but in respect to a gentleman of the same cloth , who give we he company . , when dinner be over , and the servant be withdrawn , say , " my dear , 's business , in part , be to ask my advice as to a living that be offer he by the of ----, who be greatly take with he preaching and conversation . " " and to quit yours , I presume , , " say . " no , the earl 's be not quite so good as mine , and he lordship would procure he a dispensation to hold both . what would _you_ advise , my dear ? " " it become not I , , to meddle with such matter as these . " --" yes , my dear , it do , when I ask you opinion . " --" I beg pardon , .-- my opinion then be , that will not care to do any thing that _require a dispensation , and which would be unlawful without it . " --" madam , " say , " you speak exceedingly well . " " I be glad , , that you approve of my sentiment , require of I by one who have a right to command I in every thing : otherwise this matter be above my sphere ; and I have so much good will to , that I wish he every thing that will contribute to make he happy . " " well , my dear , " say , " but what would you advise in this case ? the earl propose , that 's present living be supply by a curate ; to whom , no doubt , will be very genteel ; and , as we be seldom or never there , he lordship think we shall not be displease with it , and insist upon propose it to I ; as he have do . " Davers say , " I think this may do very well , brother . but what , pray , , do you propose to allow to you curate ? excuse I , , but I think the clergy do so hardly by one another generally , that they be not to be surprised that some of the laity treat they as they do . " , " tell we freely , , what you would advise you friend to do . " " and must I , , speak my mind on such a point , before so many better judge ? " " yes , _sister , " say she ladyship ( a name she be now pleased to give I freely before stranger , after she dear brother 's example , who be kindest , though always kind , at such time ) " you _must ; if I may be allow to say _must _. " --" why then , " proceed I , " I beg leave to ask one question ; that be , whether he present parishioners do not respect and esteem he in that particular manner , which I think every body must , who know he worth ? " " I be very happy . Madam , in the good - will of all my parishioner , and have great acknowledgment to make for they civility to I . " --" I do not doubt , " say I , " but it will be the same wherever you go ; for bad as the world be , a prudent and good clergyman will never fail of respect . but , , if you think you ministry among they be attend with good effect ; if they esteem you person with a preference , and listen to you doctrine with attention ; methinks , for _their_ sake , ' ttis pity to leave they , be the living of less value , as it be of _more
_more , than the other . for , how many people be there who can benefit by one gentleman 's preaching , rather than by another ' ; although , possibly , the one 's ability may be no way inferior to the other 's ? there be much in a _delivery , as it be call , in a manner , a deportment , to engage people 's attention and like ; and as you be already in possession of they esteem , you be sure to do much of the good you aim and wish to do . for where the flock love the shepherd , all the work be easy , and more than half do ; and without that , let he have the tongue of a angel , and let he live the life of a saint , he will be hear with indifference , and , oftentime , as he subject may be , with disgust . " I pause here ; but every one be silent -- " as to the earl 's friendship , , " continue I , " you can best judge what force that ought to have upon you ; and what I have mention would be the only difficulty with I , be I in 's case . to be sure , it will be a high compliment to he lordship , and so he ought to think it , that you quit a better living to oblige he . and he will be bound in honour to make it up to you . for I be far from think that a prudent regard to worldly interest misbecome the character of a good clergyman ; and I wish all such be set above the world , for they own sake , as well as for the sake of they hearer ; since independency give a man respect , besides the power of do good , which will enhance that respect , and of consequence , give greater efficacy to he doctrine . " as to strengthen of a good man 's influence , a point always to be wish , I would not say so much as I have do , if I have not hear Longman say , and I hear it with great pleasure , that the benefice so worthily enjoy be a clear two hundred pound a year . " but , after all , do happiness to a gentleman , a scholar , a philosopher , rest in a greater or lesser income ? on the contrary , be it not oftener to be find in a happy competency or mediocrity ? suppose my dear . have five thousand pound a year add to he present large income , would that increase he happiness ? that it would add to he care , be no question ; but could it give he one single comfort which he have not already ? and if the dear gentleman have two or three thousand less , might he be less happy on that account ? no , surely ; for it would render a greater prudence on my humble part necessary , and a nearer inspection , and greater frugality , on he own ; and he must be contente ( if he do not , as now , perhaps , lay up every year ) so long as he live within he income .-- and who will say , that the obligation to greater prudence and economy be a misfortune ? " the competency , therefore , the golden mean , be the thing ; and I have often consider the matter , and endeavoure to square my action by the result of that consideration . for a person who , be not bear to a estate , be not satisfied with a competency , will probably know no limit to he desire . one whom a acquisition of one or two hundred pound a year will not satisfy , will hardly sit down contente with any sum . for although he may propose to himself at a distance , that such and such a acquisition will be the height of he ambition ; yet he will , as he approach to that , advance upon himself farther and farther , and know no bound , till the natural one be force upon he , and he life and he view end together . " now let I humbly beg pardon of you all , lady and gentleman , " turn my eye to each ; " but most of you , my good lady . " " indeed , , " say , " after what I have hear from you , I would not , for the world , have be of another mind . " " you be a good man , " say I ; " and I have such a opinion of you worthiness , and the credit you do you function , that I can never suspect either you judgment or you conduct . but pray , , may I ask , what have you determined to do ? " --" why , Madam , " reply he , " I be stagger in that too , by the observation you just now make , that where a man have the love of he parishioner , he ought not to think of leave they . " -- " , , I find you be rather inclin to oblige the earl , though the living be of _less value ! this be very noble , ; it be more than generous . " " my dear , " say , " I will tell you ( for 's modesty will not let he speak it before all the company ) what _is_ he motive ; and a worthy one you will say it be . excuse I , ; " -- for
for the reverend gentleman blush . " the earl have of late year -- we all know he character -- give himself up to carousing , and he will suffer no man to go from he table sober . have take the liberty to expostulate , as become he function , with he lordship on this subject , and upon some other irregularity , so agreeably , that the earl have take a great liking to he , and promise , that he will suffer he reasoning to have a effect upon he , and that he shall reform he whole household , if he will come and live near he , and regulate he table by he own example . the countess be a very good lady , and privately pressis to oblige the earl : and this be we worthy friend 's main inducement ; with the hope , which I should mention , that he have , of preserving untainted the morals of the two young gentleman , the earl 's son , who , he fear , will be carry away by the force of such a example : and he think , as the earl 's living have fall , mine may be better supply than the earl 's , if he , as he kindly offer , give it I back again ; otherwise the earl , as he apprehend , will find out for he , some gentleman , if such a one can be find , as will rather further , than obstruct he own irregularity , as be the unhappy case of the last incumbent . " " well , " say , " I shall always have the highest respect for , for a conduct so genteel and so prudent . but , brother , will you -- and will you , -- put this whole affair into . . 's hand , since you have such testimony , _both of you , of the rectitude of she think and act ? " -- " with all my heart , madam , " reply ; " and I shall be proud of such a direction , " -- " what say _yout , brother ? you be to suppose the living in you own hand again ; will you leave the whole matter to my _sister_ here ? " -- " come , my dear , " say , " let we hear how you would wish it to be order . I know you have not need of one moment 's consideration , when once you be mistress of a point . " " Nay , " say , " that be not the thing . I repeat my demand : shall it be as lay it out , or not ? " --" Conditionally , " say , " provide I can not give satisfactory reason , why I _otch not to conform to she opinion ; for this , as I say , be a point of conscience with I ; and I make it so , when I present to the living : and have not be deceive in that presentation . " -- " to be sure , " say I , " that be very reasonable , ; and on that condition , I shall the less hesitate to speak my mind , because I shall be in no danger to commit a irreparable error . " " I know well , , " add , " the power you sex have over ours , and they subtle trick : and so will never , in my weakest moment , be draw in to make a blindfold promise . there have be several instance , both in sacred and profane story , of mischief do by such surprise : so you must allow I to suspect myself , when I know the dear slut 's power over I , and have be teach , by the inviolable regard she pay to she own word , to value mine -- and now , , speak all that be in you heart to say . " " with you _requisite_ condition in my eye , I will , . but let I see that I state the matter right . and , preparative to it , pray , , though you have not be long in possession of this live , yet , may - be , you can compute what it be likely , by what you know of it , to bring in clear ? " " madam , " say he , " by the best calculation I can make -- I thank _you_ for it , good Sir -- it may , one year with another , be reckon at three hundred pound per annum ; and be the best within twenty mile of it , have be improve within these two last year . " " if it be five hundred pound , and would make you happier --( for _that , , be the thing ) I should wish it you , " say I , " and think it short of you merit . but pray , , what be the earl 's living value at ? " " at about two hundred and twenty pound , . " -- " well , then , " reply I , very pertly , " I believe now I have it . " , for motive most excellently worthy of he function , incline to surrender up to . he living of three hundred pound per annum , and to accept of the earl 's living of two hundred and twenty . dear sir , I be go to be very bold ; but under _your_ condition nevertheless :-- let the gentleman , to whom you shall present the living of allow eighty pound per annum out of it to , till
till the earl 's favour shall make up the difference to he , and no longer . and -- but I dare not name the gentleman :-- for how , dear , be I to be so bold , shall I part with my chaplain ?

" say and , in the same word . the countess praise the decision too ; and with he " let I be hang ' , " and he " fore 's , " and such exclamation natural to he , make he plaudit . say , he could wish with all he heart it might be so ; and be so abashed and surprised , that he could not hold up he head ; -- but joy dance in he silent countenance , for all that . have hesitate a few minute . lady Davers call out for he objection , or consent , accord to condition , and he say , " I can not so soon determine as that prompt slut do . I will withdraw one minute . " he do so , as I find afterwards to advise , like the considerate and genteel spirit he possess , with , whom he beckon out , and to examine whether he be in _earnest_ willing to give it up , or very desirous for any one to succeed he ; say , that if he have , he think himself oblige , in return for he worthy behaviour to he , to pay a particular regard to he recommendation . and so be answer as he desire , in they come together again . but I should say , that he withdraw with a very serious aspect , make I afraid I have go too far : and I say , " what shall I do , if I have incur . anger by my over-forwardness ! do he not look displease ? dear lady , if he be so , plead for I , and I will withdraw when he come in ; for I can not stand he anger : I have not be use to it .

" " I have not propose anything , , as to that , for I have not ask you kind direction : but the good dean will supply we , I doubt not , and when we set out for , will be at full liberty , with he worthy friend , , to pursue the happy scheme you goodness have permit to take effect . " " , my dear , who come so lately from the university , can , perhaps , recommend such another young gentleman as himself , to perform the function he use to perform in you family . " I look , it seem , a little grave ; and say , " what have you to offer , ?-- what have I say amiss ? " " ! dear sir !-- " " ay , and dear too ! I see by you bashful seriousness , in place of that smile approbation which you always show when I utter any thing you _entirely approve , that I have say something which would rather meet with you acquiescence , than choice . so , as I have often tell you , none of you reserve ; and never _hesitate to I you consent in any thing , while you be sure I will conform to you wish , or pursue my own liking , as _either shall appear reasonable to I , when I have hear _your_ reason . " " why , then , dear , what I have presume to think , but I submit it to you better judgment , be , whether , since the gentleman who be so kind as to assist we in we family devotion , in some measure act in the province of the worthy dean , it be not right , that we own parish - minister , whether here or in , should name , or at least approve _our_ name , the gentleman ? " " why could not I have think of that , as well as you , sauce - box ? -- , I be entirely on you side : I think she deserve a slap now from we both . " " I will forgive she , " say my lady , " since I find she sentiment and action as much a reproof to other as to I . " " , do you ever think , " say , " it would have come to this ? -- do you ever know such a saucy girl in you life ?-- already to give herself these reproach air ? " --" no , never , if you honour be pleased to call the most excellent lady in the world by such a name , nor any body else . " " , I charge you , " say the dear gentleman , " if you _study for it , be sometimes in the wrong , that one may not always be take lesson from such a assurance ; but in we turn , have something to teach _you_. " " then , dear , " say I , " must I not be a strange creature ? for how , when you , and my good lady , be continually give I such charming example , can I do a wrong thing ? " I hope you will forgive I , my dear , for be so tedious on the foregoing subject , and its most agreeable conclusion . it be a important one , because several person , as conferer or receiver , have find they pleasure and account in it ; and it would be well , if conversation be often attend with like happy consequence . I have one merit to plead in behalf even of my prolixity ; that in recit the delightful conference I have the pleasure of hold with we noble guest and , I be careful not to write twice upon one topic , although several which I omit , may be more worthy of you notice than those I give ; so that you have as much variety from I , as the nature of the fact and case will admit of . but here I will conclude , have a very different subject , as a proof of what I have advanced , to touch in my next . till when , I be _your most affectionate and faithful , my dear , I
I now proceed with my journal , which I bring down to evening ; and of course I begin with . evening come , on horseback , attend by two servants in livery . I be abroad ; for I have get leave for a whole afternoon , attend by my ; which time I pass in visit no less than four poor sick family , whose heart I make glad . but I should be too tedious , be I to give you the particular ; beside , I have a brief list of case , which , when you will favour I with you company , I may show you : for I oblige myself , though not desire , to keep a account of what I do with no less than two hundred pound a year , that allow I to expend in act of charity and benevolence . lady Davers tell I afterwards , that carry it mighty stiff and formal when he alight . he strut about the court - yard in he boot , with he whip in he hand ; and though she ladyship go to the great door , in order to welcome he , he turn short , and , whistl , follow the groom into the stable , as if he have be at a inn , only , instead of take off he hat , pull its broad brim over he eye , for a compliment . in she go in a pet , as she say , say to the countess , " a surly brute he always be ! My_ uncle ! he be more of a ostler than a gentleman ; I be resolve I will not stir to meet he again . and yet the wretch love respect from other , though he never practise common civility himself . " the countess say , she be glad he be come , for she love to divert herself with such odd character now - and - then . and now let I give you a short description of he as I find he , when I come in , that you may the better conceive what sort of a gentleman he be . he be about sixty - five year of age , a coarse , strong , big - bone man , with large irregular feature ; he have a haughty supercilious look , a swaggering gait , and a person not at all bespeaking one 's favour in behalf of he mind ; and he mind , as you shall hear by and bye , not clear up those prepossession in he disfavour , with which he person and feature at first strike one . he voice be big and surly ; he eyes little and fiery ; he mouth large , with yellow and blackish tooth , what be leave of they be break off to a tolerable regular height , look as if they be ground down to he gum , by constant use . but with all these imperfection , he have a air that set he somewhat above the mere vulgar , and make one think half he disadvantage rather owe to he own haughty humour , than to nature ; for he seem to be a perfect tyrant at first sight , a man use to prescribe , and not to be prescribe to ; and have the advantage of a shrewd penetrating look , but which seem rather acquired than natural . after he have see he horse well serve , and put on a old - fashioned gold - button coat , which by its freshness shew he have be very chary of it , a better wig , but in stiff buckle , and a long sword , stick stifinitely , as if through he coat lappet , in he come , and with a imperious air enter the parlour , " what , nobody come to meet I ! " say he ; and salut she ladyship . " how do you do , niece ? " and look about haughtily , she say , as if he expect to see I . my lady present the countess , say , " the Countess of , ! " -- " you most obedient humble servant , . I hope he lordship be well . " -- " at you service , . " " I wish he be , " say he , bluntly ; " he should not have vote as he do last session , I can tell you that . " " why , , " say she , " _servant _, in this free kingdom , do not always do as they _master would have th'ey . " --" _mine_ do , I can tell you that . madam . " " right or wrong , ? " --" it can not be wrong if I command they . " -- " why , truly , , there be many a private gentleman carry it higher to a servant , than he care he _prince_ should to he ; but I think , till now , it be the king only that could do no wrong . " " but I always take care to be right . " --" a good reason -- because , I dare say , you never think you can be in the wrong . " -- " you ladyship should spare I : I be but just come off a journey . let I turn myself about , and I will be up with you , never fear . madam .-- but where be my nephew , ? and where be you lord ? I be tell you be all here , and young too upon a very extraordinary occasion ; so I be willing to see how causis go among you . it will be
be long enough before you come to see I . " --" my brother , and , and h . have all rode out . " -- " well , niece , " strutt with he hand behind he , and he head hold up -- " !-- he have make a fine kettle o not -- ha not he ?-- that ever such a rake should be so catch ! they tell I , she be plaguy cunning , and quite smart and handsome . but I wish he father be liive . yet what could he have do ? you brother be always unmanageable . I wish he have be my son ; by my faith , I do ! what ! I hope , niece , he lock up he baby , while you be here ? you do not keep she company , do you ? " " yes , , I do : and you will do so too , when you see she . " -- " why , thou countenancest he in he folly , child : I have a better opinion of thy spirit ! thou marry to a lord , and thy brother to a -- can 'st tell I what , ? if thou can 'st , pr'ythee do . " --" to a angel ; and so you will say presently . " " what , dost think I shall look through _his_ foolish eye ? what a disgrace to a family ancienter than the ! _O ! of !_ what will this world come to ? " the countess be divert with this odd gentleman , but run on in my praise , for fear he should say some rude thing to I when I come in ; and second she . but all signify nothing . he would tell we both he mind , let the young whelp ( that be he word ) take it as he would -- " and pray , " say he , " can not I see this fine body before he come in ? let I but turn she round two or three time , and ask she a question or two ; and by she answer I shall know what to think of she in a twinkling . " -- " she be gone to take a little airing , , and will not be back till supper - time . " " supper- time ! why , she be not to sit at table , be she ? if she do , I will not ; that be positive . but now you talk of a supper , what have you ?-- I must have a boiled chicken , and shall eat it all myself . who be housekeeper now ? I suppose all 's turn upside down . " " no , there be not one new servant , except a girl that wait upon she own person : all the old one remain . " -- " that be much ! these creature generally take as great state upon they as a born lady ; and they be in the right . if they can make the man stoop to the great point , they will hold he nose to the grind - stone : and all the little one come about in course . " -- " well , , when you see she , you will alter you mind . " --" never , never ; that be positive . " " ay , , I be as positive as you once ; but I love she now as well as if she be my own sister . " " of hideous , hideous ! all the fool he have make wherever he have travel , will clap they hand at he , and at you too , if you talk at this rate . but let I speak to , if she be here : I will order my own supper . " so he go out , say , he know the house , though in a better mistress 's day . the countess say , if as she hope , keep he temper , there would be good diversion with the old gentleman . " o yes , " say my lady , " my brother while , I dare say . he despise the surly brute too much to be angry with he , say what he will . " he talk a great deal against I to . you may guess , my dear , that she launch out in my praise ; and he be offend at she , and say , " woman ! woman ! forbear these ill - time praise ; she birth be a disgrace to we family . what ! my sister 's waiting - maid , take upon charity ! I can not bear it . " I mention all these thing , as I afterwards hear they , because it shall prepare you to judge what a fine time I be likely to have of it . when and my , and come home , which they do about half a hour after six , they be tell who be there , just as they enter the parlour ; and smile at , and enter , " , " say he , " welcome to ; and thrice welcome to this house ; I rejoice to see you . " my lady say , never be so odd a figure as the old baronet make , when thus accost . he stand up indeed ; but as offer to take he hand , he put th'ey both behind he . " not that you know of . ! " and then look up at he face , and down at he foot , three or four time successively , " be you
you my brother 's son ? that very individual son , that you good father use to boast of , and say , that for handsome person , true courage , noble mind , be not to be match in any three county in ? " " the very same , dear , that my honoured father 's partiality use to think he never praise enough . " " and what be all of it come to at last ? -- he pay well , do he not , to teach you to know the world , nephew ! hadst thou be bear a fool , or a raw greenhead , or a doat greyhead --" -- " what then , ? " --" why then thou wouldst have do just as thou hast do ! " -- " come , come , , you know not my inducement . you know not what a angel I have in person and mind . you eye shall by and bye be blest with the sight of she : you ear with hear she speak : and then you will call all you have say , profanation . " --" what be it I hear ? you talk in the language of romance ; and from the housekeeper to the head of the house , you be all stark sta mad . nephew , I wish , for thy own credit , thou wert -- but what signify wish ?-- I hope you will not bring you sy into my company . " " yes , I will , , because I love to give you pleasure . and say not a word more , for you own sake , till you see she . you will have the less to , , and the less to repent off . " " I be in a enchanted castle , that be certain . what a plague have this little witch do to you all ? and how do she bring it about ? " the lady and laugh , it seem ; and begge he to sit down , and answer he some family question , he say , ( for it seem he be very captious at time ) , " what , be I to be laugh at ! -- , I hope _you be not bewitch , too , be you ? " --" indeed , , I be . my sister be my doating - piece . " " Whew ! " whistle he , with a wild stare : " and how be it with you , youngster ? " --" with I , ? " say , " I would give all I be worth in the world , and ever shall be worth , for such another wife . " he run to the window , and throw up the sash look into the court - yard , say , " Hollo -- so - ho ! --Get I my horse ! -- I will keep no such company !-- I will be gone ! why , ! " call again . " you be not in , , " say . " I be !--i 'll away to the village this night ! why you be all upon the high game ! I will -- but who come here ? " -- for just then , the chariot bring I into the court - yard -- " who be this ? who be she ? " -- " one of _my daughter , " start up the countess ; " my youngest daughter ! -- she be the pride of my family , ! " --" I be run ; for I think it be the grand enchantress . " out step Lady Davers to I ; " dear , " say she , " humwe all that be say to you . here be come . you be the Countess of . 's youngest daughter -- that be you cue . " -- " ah ? but , , " say I , " be not marry , " look ( before I think ) on a circumstance that I think too much of sometimes , though I carry it off as well as I can . she laugh at my exception : " come , , " say she , ( for I just enter the great door ) , " I hope you have have a fine airing . " --" a very pretty one , madam , " say I , as I enter the parlour . " this be a pleasant country , . " ( " when I be wrong , " whisper I ) , " 's b.? " then , as see a strange gentleman , I start half back , into a more reserve air ; and make he a low curt 'sy . look as if he do not know what to think of it , now at I , now at . who put he quite out of doubt , by take my hand : " well , , do you meet my fugitive in you tour ? " " no , . do she go my way ? I tell you I would keep the great road . " -- " , " say , present I to he uncle . " a charme creature ! " add he : " have you not a son worthy of such a alliance ? " --" ay , nephew , this be a lady indeed ! why the plague , " whisper he , " could you not have pitch you tent here ? , by you leave , " and salut I , turn to the countess . " madam , you have a charming daughter ! have my rash nephew see this lovely creature , and you condescende , he would never have
have stoop to the cottage as he have do . " -- " you be right , , " say ; " but I always run too fast for my fortune : yet these lady of family never bring out they jewel into bachelor ' company ; and when , too late , we see what we have miss , we be vex at we precipitation . " " well say , however , boy . I wish thee repentance , though ' ti out of thy power to mmend . be that one of thy curse , when thou seest this lady ; as no doubt it be . " again survey I from head to foot , and turn I round , which , it seem , be a mighty practice with he to a stranger lady , ( and a modest one too , you will say , ) -- " why , truly , you be a charme creature , -- I would say -- by you leave , once more !-- my Lady Countess , she be a charmer ! but --but --" star at I , " be you marry , ? " I look a little silly ; and my new mamma come up to I , and take my hand : " why , , you be dress oddly to -day !-- what a hoop you wear ; it make you look I can not tell how ! " " madam , I think so ; what signify lie ? --but ' tis only the hoop , I see -- really , , you hoop be enough to make half a hundred of we sex despair , lest you should be marry . I think it be something ! few lady escape my notice . I always keep a good look - out ; for I have two daughter of my own . but ' ti the hoop , I see plainly enough . you be so slender every where but _here , " put he hand upon my hip which quite dash I ; and I retire behind my 's chair . " , ! " say ; " before we young gentleman , to take such liberty with a maiden lady ! you give a bad example . " --" hang he that set 's you a bad example , nephew . but I see you be right ; I see 's a maiden lady , or she would not have be so shamefaced . I will swear for she on occasion . , ha , ha !-- I be sure , " repeat he , " she be a maiden -- for we sex give the married lady a freer air in a trice . " --" how , ! " say . " of fie ! " say the countess . " can not you praise the maiden lady , but at the expense of the married one ! what do you see of freedom in I ? " --" or in I ? " say . " Nay , for that matter you be very well , I must need say . but will you pretend to blush with that virgin rise ?-- Od be my life , -- I would say , come from behind you mamma 's chair , and you two lady stand up now together . there , so you do -- Why now , blush for blush , and shall be three to one , and a deeper crimson by half . look you there else ! a hundred guinea to one against the field . " then stamp with one foot , and lift up he hand and eye " have it all to nothing -- , ha , ha ! you may well sit down both of you ; but you be a blush too late , I can tell you that . well hast thou do . , " tap my shoulder with he rough paw . I be hasten away , and he say , " but let 's see you again , ; for now will I stay , if they bring nobody else . " and away I go ; for I be quite out of countenance , " what a strange creature , " think I , " be this ! " be near ready , he call out for , for the sight of she , he say , do he good ; but he be resolve not to sit down to table with _somebody else . the countess say , she would fetch she daughter ; and step out , return say , " . understand that be here , and do not choose to see she ; so she beg to be excuse ; and my and she desire to sup together . " " the very worst tiding I have hear this twelvemonth . why , nephew , let you girl sup with any body , so we may have back with we . " --" I know , " say the countess , ( who be desirous to see how far he could carry it ) , " will not leave ; so if you see _one_ , you must see _t'other _. " --" Nay , then I must sit down contente . yet I should be glad to see . but I will not sit at table with . girl -- that be positive . " " well , well , let them sup together , and there be a end of it , " say . " I see my uncle have as good a judgment as any body of fine lady . " --( " that I have , nephew._" ) --" but he can not forgo he humour , in compliment to the finest lady in . " " consider , nephew , ' tis not
not thy do a foolish thing , and call a girl wife , shall crbe a niece down my throat , that be positive . the moment she come down to take place of these ladie , I be gone , that be most certain . " -- " well then , shall I go up , and oblige to sup by herself , and persuade to come down to we ? " -- " with all my soul , nephew ,-- a good notion .--But , -- do you say _queer_ sort of name ! I have hear of it somewhere !-- be it a or a Pagan name ?-- Linsey - woolsey -- half one , half t'other -- like thy girl -- , ha , ha. " --" let I be _hang have , " whisper to he aunt , " if have not a power of wit ; though he be so whimsical with it . I like he much . " --" but hark ye , nephew , " say , " one word with you . do not fob upon we you girl with the Pagan name for . I have set a mark upon she , and should know she from a thousand , although she have change she hoop . " then he laugh again , and say , he hope would come -- and without any body with she -- " but I smell a plot , " say he -- " by my soul I will not stay , if they both come together . I will not be put upon -- but here be one or both -- where be my whip ?--I will go . " --" indeed , , I have rather have stay with , " say I , as I enter , as he have bid I . " ' she ! ' ti she ! you have nobody behind you !-- no , she ha not -- why now , nephew , you be right ; I be afraid you would have put a trick upon I .-- you would _rather , " repeat he to I , " have staid with . .!-- yes , I warrant -- but you shall be place in better company , my dear child . " -- " sister , " say , " will you take that chair ; for do not choose to give my uncle disgust , who so seldom come to see we . " my lady take the upper end of the table , and I sit next below my new mamma . " so , , " say she , " how have you leave Mrs . benefit .? " --" a little concerned ; but she be the easier , as . himself desire I would come down . " my sit next I , and say , " shall I beg a favour of you , my lord , to let I sit next to ? " say , " will not it be better to sit over -against she , uncle ? " --" ay , that be right . I ' faith , nephew , thou know 'st what be right . well , so I will . " he accordingly remove he seat , and I be very glad of it ; for though I be sure to be star at by he , yet I fear if he sit next I , he would not keep he hand off my hoop . he run on a deal in my praise , after he manner , but so rough at time , that he give I pain ; and I be afraid too , lest he should observe my ring ; but he stare so much in my face , that it escape he notice . after supper , the gentleman sit down to they bottle , and the lady and I withdraw , and about twelve they break up ; talk of nothing but , and wish . have happily marry such a charme creature , who carry token of she high birth in she face , and whose every feature and look shew she to be nobly descende . they let he go to be with he mistake : but the countess say next morning , she think she never see a greater instance of stupid pride and churlishness ; and should be sick of the advantage of birth or ancestry , if this be the natural fruit of it . " for a man , " say she ladyship , " to come to he nephew 's house , and to suffer the mistress of it to be closet up ( as he think ) , in order to humour he absurd and brutal insolence , and to behave as he have do , be such a ridicule upon the pride of descent , that I shall ever think of it .-- of , " say she , " what advantage have you over every one that see you ; but most over those who pretend to treat you unworthily ! " I expect to be call to breakfast every minute , and shall then , perhaps , see how this matter will end . I wish , when it be reveal , he may not be in a fury , and think himself impos on . I fear it will not go off so well as I wish ; for every body seem to be grave , and angry at . thursday . I now proceed with my tale . at breakfast - time , when every one be sit , begin to call out for . " but , " say he , " I will have none of you girl , nephew : although the chair at the tea - table be left for somebody . " -- " no ,
, " say , " we will get to supply . b .' place , since you do not care to see she . " -- " with all my heart , " reply he .--" but , uncle , " say , " have you really no desire , no curiosity to see the girl I have marry ? " --" no , none at all , by my soul . " just then I come in , and pay my compliment to the company , and to -- " shall I , " say I , " supply Mr . b . place in she absence ? " and down I sit . after breakfast , and the servant be withdrawn -- " , " say , " you be a young lady , with all the advantages of birth and descent , and some of the best blood in the kingdom run in you vein ; and here be you great admirer ; can not _yout , from whom it will come with a double grace , convince he that he act unkindly at my brother 's house , to keep the person he have think worthy of make the mistress of it , out of company ? and let we know you opinion , whether my brother himself do right , to comply with such a unreasonable distaste ? " --" why , how now , Lady Davers ! this from you ! I do not expect it ! " " my uncle , " say , " be the only person in the kingdom that I would have humoure thus : and i make no doubt , when he see how willing I be to oblige he in such a point , he would have act a more generous part than he have yet do .-- but , , what say you to my sister 's question ? " " if I must speak my mind , " reply I , " I should take the liberty to be very serious with , and to say , that when a thing be do , and can not be help , he should take care how he sow the seed of indifference and animosity between man and wife , and make a gentleman dissatisfie with he choice , and perhaps unhappy as long as he live . " -- " Nay , , " say he , " if all be against I , and you , whose good opinion I value most , you may e'en let the girl come , and sit down . -- if she be but half as pretty , and half as wise , and modest , as you , I shall , as it can not be help , as you say , be ready to think better of the matter . for ' ttis a little hard , I must need say , if she have hithertoo appear before all the good company , to keep she out of the way on my account . " -- " really , , " say the countess , " I have blush for you more than once on this occasion . but the mistress of this house be more than half as wise , and modest , and lovely : and in hope you will return I back some of the blush I have lent you , see _there , in my daughter , whom you have be so justly admir , the mistress of the house , and the lady with the Pagan name . " sit aghast , look at we all in turn , and then cast he eye on the floor . at last , up he get , and swore a sad oath : " and be I thus trick and bamboozl , " that be he word ; " be I ? there be no bearing this house , nor she presence , now , that be certain ; and I will bego . " look at I , and nodd he head towards , as he be in a flutter to bego , I rise from my chair , and go to he , and take he hand . " I hope , , you will be able to bear _both_ , when you shall see no other difference but that of descent , between the suppose you so kindly praise , and the girl you dear nephew have so much exalt . " --" let I go , " say he ; " I be most confoundedly bit . I can not look you in the face ! by my soul , I cannot ! for ' ttis impossible you should forgive I . " -- " indeed it be not , Sir ; you have do nothing but what I can forgive you for , if you dear nephew can ; for to he be the wrong , if any , and I be sure he can overlook it . and for he sake , to the uncle of so honoure a gentleman , to the brother of my late good lady , I can , with a bent knee , _thus , ask you blessing , and you excuse for join to keep you in this suspense . " --" bless you ! " say he , and stampe -- " who can choose but bless you ? " - and he knee down , and wrap he arm about I .--" but , curse I , " that be he strange word , " if ever I be so touch before ! " my dear , for fear my spirits should be too much affect ( for the rough baronet , in he transport , have bend I down lower than I knee ) , come and hold my arm ; but permit to raise I ; only say ,
, " how do my angel ? now she have make this conquest , she have complete all she triumph . " -- " , do you call she ?-- I be confound with she goodness , and she sweet carriage !-- rise , and let I see if I can stand myself ! and , believe I , I be sorry I have act thus so much like a bear ; and the more I think of it , the more I shall be asham of myself . " and the tear , as he speak , run down he rough cheek ; which move I much ; for to see a man with so hard a countenance weep , be a touching sight . put he handkerchief to he eye , he aunt say , " what be the matter , ? " --" I do not know how ' tis , " answer he ; " but here 's strange doings , as ever I know -- for , day after day , one be ready to cry , without know whether it be for joy or sorrow ! -- what a plague be the matter with I , I wonder ! " and out he go , the two lady , whose charme eye , too , glisten with pleasure , smile at the effect the scene have upon . and at what he say .-- " well , , " say , approach I ; for I have sit down , but then stand up -- " you will forgive I ; and from my heart I wish you joy . by my soul I do , " -- and salute I .--" I could not have believe there have be such a person breathing . I do not wonder at my nephew 's love you !--And you call she sister , , do not you ?-- if you do , I will own she for my niece . " " do not I !--Ye , I do , " say she , come to I , " and be proud so to call she . and this I tell you , for _your_ comfort , though to _my own shame , that I use she worse than you have do , before I know she excellence ; and have repent of it ever since . " I bow to she ladyship , and kiss she hand -- " my dearest lady , " say I , " you have make I such rich amend since , that I be sure I may say , ' it be good for I that I be afflict !_' " --" why , nephew , she have the fear of , I perceive , before she eye too ! I be sure I have hear those word . they be somewhere in the Scripture , I believe !-- why , who know but she may be a means to save you soul ! --hey , you know ! " -- " ay , , she will be a means to save a hundred soul , and might go a great way to save yours if you be to live with she but one month . " " well , but , nephew , I hope you forgive I too ; for now I think of it , I never know you take any matter so patiently in my life . " --" I know , " say , " that every extravagance you insist upon , be heighten my charmer 's triumph , and increase you own contrition ; and , as I be not _indeed deprive of she company , I could bear with every thing you say or do -- yet , do not you remember my caution , that the less you say against she , the less you would have to unsay , and the less to repent off ! " " I do ; and let I ride out , and call myself to account for all I have say against she , in she own hearing ; and when I can think of but one half , and how she have take it , by my soul , I believe 'twill make I _more_ than half mad . " at dinner ( when we have 's company ) , the baronet tell I , he admire I now , as much as when he think I ; but complain of the trick put upon he by we all , and see now and then a little serious upon it . he take great notice of the dexterity which he impute to I , in perform the honour of the table . and every now and then , he lift up he eye -- " very clever .-- why , Madam , you seem to I to be bear to these thing !-- I will be help by nobody but you -- and you will have a task of it , I can tell you ; for I have a whipping stomach , and be there fifty dish , I always taste of every one . " and , indeed , be in a manner wholly employ in go to and for between the baronet and I , for half a hour together .-- he go from we afterwards to , and make she answer many question about I , and how all these matters have _come about , as he phrase it ; and return , when we drank coffee , say , " I have be _confabb with , about you , niece . I never hear the like ! she say you can play on the harpsichord , and s too ; will you let a body have a tune or so ? my Mab can play pretty well , and so can Dolly ; I be a judge of music
music , and would afain hear you . " I say , if he be a judge , I should be afraid to play before he ; but I would not be ask twice , after we coffee . accordingly he repeat he request . I give he a tune , and , at he desire , sung to it : " 's my life , " say he , " you do it purely !-- but I see where it be . my girl have get _my finger ! " then he hold both hand out , and a fine pair of paw shew he . " of not , they touch two key at once ; but those slender and nimble finger , how they sweep along ! my eye can not follow th'ey -- Whew , " whistle he , " they be here and there , and every where at once !-- why , nephew , I believe you have put another trick upon I . my niece be certainly of quality ! and report have not do she justice .-- one more tune , one more song -- by my faith , you voice go sweetly to you finger . ' Slife -- I will thrash my jade , " that be he polite phrase , " when I get home .-- Lady Davers , you know not the money they have cost I to qualify they ; and here be a mere baby to they outdo 'em by a bar 's length , without any expense at all bestow upon she . go over that again -- Confound I for a puppy ! I lose it by my prating .-- ay , there you have it ! oh ! that I could but dance as well as thou se 'st ! I would give you a saraband , old as I be . " after supper , we fall into a conversation , of which I must give you some account , be on a topic that . have be blame for in he marry I , and which have stick by some of he friend , even after they have , in kindness to I , acquit he in every other respect ; and that be , the example he have set to young gentleman of family and fortune to marry beneath they _.-- it be begin by , who say , " I be in love with my new niece , that I be : but still one thing stick with I in this affair , which be , what will become of degree or distinction , if this practice of gentleman marry they mother 's waiting - maid -- excuse I , Madam -- should come into vogue ? already , young lady and young gentleman be too apt to be draw away thus , and disgrase they family . we have too many instance of this . you will forgive I , both of you . " " that , " say , " be the _only thing ! -- have hit upon the point that would make one wish this example have not be set by a gentleman of such a ancient family , till one become acquainted with this dear creature ; and then every body think it should not be otherwise than it be . " " ay , , " say , " what can you say to this ? can not you defend I from this charge ? this be a point that have be often object to I ; try for one of you pretty argument in my behalf . " " indeed , , " reply I , look down , " it become not I to say any thing to this ." --" but indeed it do , if you can : and I beg you will help I to some excuse , if you have any at hand . " -- " will not you . , dispense with I on this occasion ? I know , not what to say . indeed I should not , if I may judge for myself , speak one _word to this subject .-- for it be my absolute opinion , that degree in general should be keep up ; although I must always deem the present case a happy exception to the rule . " look as if he still expect I should say something .-- " will not you , Sir , dispense with I ? " repeat I . " indeed I should not speak to this point , if I may be my own judge . " " I always intend , my dear , you shall judge for yourself ; and , you know , I seldom urge you farther , when you use those word . but if you have any thing upon you mind to say , let 's have it ; for you argument be always new and unborrowed . " " I would then , if I _must , , ask , if there be not a nation , or if there have not be a law in some nation , which , whenever a young gentleman , be _his_ degree what it would , have seduce a poor creature , be _her_ degree what it would , oblige he to marry that unhappy person ? " --" I think there be such a law in some country , I can not tell where , " say . " and do you think , , whether it be so or not , that it be equitable it should be so ? " " yes , by my troth . though I must need own , if it be so in , many man , that I know , would not have the wife they now have . " --" you speak to you knowledge , I
I doubt not , ? " say . " why , truly -- I do not know but I do . " " all then , " say I , " that I would infer , be , whether another law would not be a still more just and equitable one , that the gentleman who be repulse , from a principle of virtue and honour , should not be censure for marry a person he could not seduce ? and whether it be not more for both they honour , if he do : since it be nobler to reward a virtue , than to repair a shame , be that shame to be repair by matrimony , which I take the liberty to doubt . but I beg pardon : you command I , , else this subject should not have find a speaker to it , in I . " " this be admirably say , " cry .--" but yet this come not up to the objection , " say . " they set a example to wait - maid to aspire , and to young gentleman to descmend . and I will enter into the subject myself ; and the rather , because as I go along , I will give a faint sketch of the merit and character of my , of which he can not be so well inform as he have be of the disgrace which he imagine I have bring upon myself by marry she .-- I think it necessary , that as well those person who be afraid the example should be take , as those who be inclin to follow it , should consider _all_ the material part of it ; otherwise , I think the precedent may be justly cleared ; and the fear of the one be judge groundless , and the plea of the other but a pretence , in order to cover a folly into which they would have fall , whether they have this example or not . for instance , in order to lay claim to the excuse , which my conduct , if I may suppose it of force enough to do either good or hurt , will furnish , it be necessary , that the object of they wish should be a girl of exquisite beauty ( and that not only in they own blinded and partial judgment , but in the opinion of _every one_ who see she , friend or foe ) , in order to justify the force which the _first_ attraction have upon he : that she be descende of honest and conscientious , though poor and obscure parent ; who have preserve they integrity , through great trials and affliction , have , by they example , as well as precept , laid deep in the girl 's mind the foundation of piety and virtue . " it be necessary that , to the charms of person , this wait -maid , should have a humble , teachable mind , fine natural part , a sprightly , yet inoffensive wit , a temper so excellent , and a judgment so solid , as should promise ( by the love and esteem these quality should attract to herself from she fellow - servants , superior and inferior ) that she would become a higher station , and be respect in it . -- and that , after so good a foundation lay by she parent , she should have all the advantages of female education confer upon she ; the example of a excellent lady , improve and build upon so worthy a foundation : a capacity surprisingly ready to take in all that be teach she : a attention , assiduity , and diligence almost peculiar to herself , at she time of life ; so as , at fifteen or sixteen year of age , to be able to vie with any young lady of rank , as well in the natural genteelness of she person , as in she acquirement : and that in nothing but she humility she should manifest any difference between herself and the high - bear . " it will be necessary , moreover , that she should have a mind above temptation ; that she should resist the _offer and _menace of one upon whom all she worldly happiness seem to depend ; the son of a lady to whom she owe the greatest obligation ; a person whom she do not _hate , but greatly _fear , and whom she grateful heart would have be _glad to oblige ; and who seek to prevail over she virtue , by all the inducement that could be think of , to _attract a young unexperienced virgin at one time , or to _frighten_ she at another , into he purpose ; who offer she very high term , she circumstance consider , as well for herself , as for parent she love better than herself , whose circumstance be low and distressful ; yet , to all these _offer and _menace , that she should be able to answer in such word as these , which will always dwell upon my memory -- 'I reject you proposal with all my soul . God desert I , whenever I make worldly grandeur my chiefest good ! I know I be in you power ; I dread you will to ruin I be as great as you power . yet , will I dare to tell you , I will make no free - will offer of my virtue . all that I _can_ do , poor as it be , I _will_ do , to show you , that my will bear no part in the violation of I . ' and when future marriage be intimate to she , to induce she to yield , to be able to answer ,
, ' the moment I yield to you proposal , there be a end of all merit , if now I have any . and I should be so far from _expecting_ such a honour that I will pronounce I should be most _unworthy of it . ' " if , I say , such a girl can be find , thus beautifully attractive in _every one 's eye , and not partially so only in a young gentle man 's _own ; and after that ( what good person would infinitely prefer to beauty ) , thus piously principle ; thus genteely educate and accomplish ; thus brilliantly witty ; thus prudent , modest , generous , undesigning ; and have be thus temp , thus try , by the man she hate not , pursue ( not intriguingly pursue ) , be thus inflexibly virtuous , and proof against temptation : let she reform she libertine , and let he marry she ; and be he of princely extraction , I dare answer for it , that no _two_ prince in _one age , take the world through , would be in danger . for , although I be sensible it be not to my credit , I will say , that I never meet with a repulse , nor a conduct like this ; and yet I never sink very low for the subject of my attempt , either at home or abroad . these be obvious inference , " add he , " not refinement upon my 's story ; and if the gentleman be capable of thought and comparison , would rather make such a example , as be apprehend , _more than _less difficult than _before . " but if , indeed , the young fellow be such a booby , that he can not _reflect_ and _compare , and take the case _with all its circumstance together , I think he good papa or mamma should get he a wife to they own liking , as soon as possible ; and the poorest girl in , who be honest , should rather bless herself for escape such a husband , than glory in the catch she would have of he . for he would hardly do honou to he family in any one instance . " --" indeed , " say the countess , " it would be pity , after all , that such a one should marry any lady of prudence and birth ; for ' tis enough in conscience , that he be a disgrace to _one_ worthy family ; it would be pity he should make _two_ unhappy . " " why , really , nephew , " say , " I think you have say much to the purpose . there be not so much danger , from the example , as I apprehend , from _sensible_ and _reflect mind . I do not consider this matter thoroughly , I must need say . " " and the business be , " say -- " you will excuse I , sister -- there will be more people hear that . have marry he mother 's wait -maid , than will know he inducement . " -- " not many , I believe , sister . for when ' tis know , I have some character in the world , and be not quite a idiot ( and my fault , in have not be one of the most virtuous of man , will stand I in some stead in _this_ case , though hardly in _any other ) they will naturally enquire into my inducement . -- but see you not , when we go abroad , what number of people she character draw to admire the dear creature ? do not this shew , that she virtue have make she more conspicuous than my fortune have make I ? for I pass up and down quietly enough before ( handsome as my equipage always be ) and attract not any body 's notice : and indeed I have as lieve these honour be not so publicly pay _her ; for even , be I fond to shew and parade , what be they , but a reproach to I ? and can I have any excellence , but a secondary one , in having , after all my persecution of she , do but common justice to she merit ?-- this answer you objection , Lady Davers , and shew that _my inducement and _her_ story must be equally kny . and I really think ( every thing I have say consider , and that might still farther be urge , and the conduct of the dear creature in the station she adorn , so much exceed all I hope or could expect from the most promise appearance ) , that she do _me_ more honou than I have do _her ; and if I could put myself in a third person 's place , I think I should be of the same opinion , be I to determine upon such another pair , exactly circumstance as we be . " you may believe , my friend , how much this generous defence of the step he have take , attribute every thing to I , and deprecat he worthy self , affect I . I play with a cork one while , with my ring another ; look down , and every way but on the company ; for they gaze too much upon I all the time ; so that I could only glance a tearful eye now and then upon the dear man ; and when it would overflow , catch in my handkerchief the escape fugitive that would start unbidden beyond they proper limit , though I often try , by a twinkling motion , to disperse the gather water , before it have
have form itself into drop too big to be restrain . all the company praise the dear generous speaker ; and he be pleased to say farther , " although , my good friend , I can truly say , that with all the pride of family , and the insolence of fortune , which once make I doubt whether I should not sink too low , if I make my my mistress ( for I should then have treat she not ungenerously , and should have suffer she , perhaps , to call herself by my name ) , I have never once repent of what I have do ; on the contrary , always rejoice in it , and it have be , from the first day of we marriage , my pride and my boast ( and shall be , let other say what they will ) , that I can call such a excellence , and such a purity , which I so little deserve , mine ; and I look down with contempt upon the rashness of all who reflect upon I ; for they can have no notion of my happiness or she merit . " " of dear , how do you overrate my poor merit ! -- some person be happy in a life of _comfort , but mine be a life of _joy !_-- one rapturous instance follow another so fast , that I know not how to bear they . " " Whew ! " whistle . " whereabouts be I ?-- I hope by - and - by you will come down to we pitch , that one may put in a word or two with you . " " may you be long thus blest and happy together ! " say . " I know not which to admire most , the dear girl that never be bad , or the dear man , who , have be bad , be now so good ! " , " there be hardly any bearing these move scene , follow one another so quick , as my sister say . " the countess be pleased to say , that till now she have be at a loss to form any notion of the happiness of the first pair before the fall ; but now , by so fine a instance as this , she comprehend it in all its force . " continue you to one another , " add she , " for a credit to the state , and to human nature . " , have he elbow on the table , fold he hand , shak they , and look down -- " , this be uncommon life , that it be ! you two soul , I can see that , be like well - tune instrument ; but they be too high set for I , a vast deal . " " the best thing , " say ( always severe upon she poor nephew ) , " thou ever saidst . the music must be equal to that of , which can make such a savage as thee dance to it . I charge thee , say not another word tonight . " -- " why , indeed , aunt , " return he , laugh , " I believe it _was_ pretty well say for you foolish fellow : though it be by chance , I must confess ; I do not think of it . " --" that I believe , " reply my lady ; " if thou hadst , thou's dst not have speak so well . " and afterwards fall into a family discourse ; and tell we of two or three courtship by he three son , and to he two daughter , and he reason for disallow they : and I could observe , he be a absolute tyrant in he family , though they be all man and woman grow , and he seem to please himself how much they stand in awe of he . I would not have be so tediously trifl , but for the sake of my dear parent ; and there be so much self - praise , as it may seem , from a person on repea the fine thing say of herself , that I be half of opinion I should send they to Kent only , and to think you should be oblige to I for save you so much trouble and impertinence . do , dear miss , be so free as to forbid I to send you any more long journal , but common letter only , of how you do ? and who and who be together , and of respects to one another , and so forth -- letter that one might dispatch , as say , in a _twinkling , and perhaps be more to the purpose than the tedious scrawl which kiss you hand , from _yours most sincerely , , dear good , let add to we delight , by she charming company . , and the new affair will divert _yout , in she absence .-- so pray , since my good have consent , and she be willing , and she sister can spare she ; do not be so cross as to deny I . * * * * * to ._ my . , you have give we great pleasure in you account of you conversation , and of the verse put so wickedly under you seat ; and in you just observation on the line , and occasion . I be quite shocked , when I think of 's passionate intention at the hall , but have let nobody into the worst of the matter , in compliance with you desire . we be delighte with the account of you family management , and you 's service
service . what a excellent lady you be ! and how happy and good you make all who know you , be see by the ladie join in you evening service , as well as they domestic . we go on here swimmingly with we courtship . never be there a fonder couple than and . the modest girl be quite alive , easy , and pleased , except now - and - then with I . we have a sad falling out t'other day . thus it be :-- she have the assurance , on my saying , they be so fond and free before - hand , that they would leave nothing for improvement afterwards , to tell I , she have long perceived , that my envy be very disquieting to I . this she say before , who have the good manners to retire , see a storm rise between we . " poor foolish girl ! " cry I , when he be go , provoke to great contempt by she expression before he , " thou will make I despise thee in spite of my heart . but , pr'ythee , manage thy matter with common decency , at least . " --" good lack ! _Common decency , do you say ? when my sister be able to show I what it be , I shall hope to be better for she example . " -- " no , thou 'lt never be better for any body 's example ! thy ill - nature and perverseness will continue to keep thee from that . " -- " my ill - temper , you have often tell I , be _natural to I ; so it must become _me :_ but upon such a sweet - tempered young lady as , she late assume petulance sit but ill ! " " I must have have no bad temper , and that every one say , to bear with thy sullen and perverse one , as I have do all my life . " " but why can not you bear with it a little longer , sister ? do any thing provoke you _now " ( with a sly leer and affect drawl ) " that do not _formerly ?_ " " provoke I !-- what should provoke I ? I give thee but a hint of thy fond folly , which make thee behave so before company , that every one smile at thee ; and I would be glad to save thee from contempt for thy _new_ good humour , as I use to try to do , for thy _old bad nature . " " be that it ? what a kind sister have I ! but I see it vex you ; and _ill - nature folk love to teaze , you know . but , dear , do not let the affection express for I , put such a good - tempered body out of humour , pray do not -- who know " ( continue the provoker , who never say a tolerable thing that be not ill - natured ) " but the gentleman may be happy that he have find a way , with so much ease , to dispense with the difficulty that eldership lay he under ? but , as he do you the favour to let the repulse come from you , do not be angry , sister , that he take you at the first word . " " indeed , " say I , with a contemptuous smile , " thou 'rt in the right , , to take the gentleman at _his_ first word . hold he fast , and play over all thy monkey trick with he , with all my heart ; who know but it may engage he more ? for , should _he leave thee , I might be too much provoke at thy ingratitude , _to turn over_ another gentleman to thee . and let I tell thee , without such a introduction , thy temper would keep any body from thee , that know it ! " " poor -- , be as easy as you can ! who know but we may find out some cousin or friend of 's between we , that we may persuade to address you ? do not make we you enemy : we will try to make you easy , if we can . ' tTis a little hard , that you should be so cruelly take at you word , that it be . " -- " Dost think , " say I , " poor , stupid , ill - judge , that I can have the same regret for parting with a man I could not like , that thou hadst , when thy vain hope meet with the repulse they deserv from .? " --" come up again ? I have not hear of he a great while . " -- " no , but it be necessary that one nail should drive out another ; for thou ' dst be repin still , have not be _turn over_ to thee . " --" _Turn over !_ you use that word once before : such great wit as you , methink , should not use the same word twice . " " how dost thou know what wits _should or should _not do ? thou hast no talent but ill - nature ; and ' tis enough for thee , that _one_ view take up thy whole thought . pursue that -- but I would only caution thee , not to _satiate_ where thou wouldst _oblige , that be all ; or , if thy man can be so gross as to like thy fondness , to leave something for _hereafter _. " " I will call he in again , sister , and
and you shall acquaint we how you would have it . " ( for the maid come in just then ) , " tell I desire he to walk in . " --" I be glad to see thee so teachable all at once !-- I find now what be the cause of thy constant perverseness : for have the unavailing lesson my mamma be always inculcat into thee , come from a _man_ thou couldst have have hope of , they have succeed better . " in come with he crutch - stick -- but can you bear this nonsense , . benefit .?--" what sparr , jangl again , you slut !--o what fiery eye on one side ! and contemptuous look on t'other ! " " why , papa , my sister have _turn over_ to I , and she want he back again , and he will not come -- that be all the matter ! " " you know , papa , never could _bear_ reproof , and yet would always _deserve_ it !-- I be only gently remark for she instruction , on she fondness before company , and she be as she _use to be !_--Courtship , indeed , be a new thing to the poor girl , and so she know not how to behave herself in it . " " so , Polly , because you have be able to run over a long list of humble servants , you must insult you sister , must you ? --but be you really concerned , Polly ?--Hey ! " --" , this or anything be very well from you . but these imputation of envy , before , must make the man very considerable with himself . poor Nancy do not consider that . but , indeed , how should she ? how should _she be able to reflect , who know not what reflection be , except of the spiteful sort ? but , papa , should the poor thing add to t_his vanity , which want no addition , at the expense of that pride , which can only preserve she from contempt ? " I see she affect , and be resolve to pursue my advantage . " , , " continue I , " canst thou not have a _little_ patience , child -- my papa will set the day as soon as he shall think it proper . and do not let thy man toil to keep pace with thy fondness ; for I have pitie he many a time , when I have see he stretch on the tenter to keep thee in countenance . " this set the ill - natured girl in tear and fretfulness ; all she old temper come upon she , as I design it should , for she have keep I at bay longer than usual ; and I leave she under the dominion of it , and because I would not come into fresh dispute , get my mamma 's leave , and go in the chariot , to beg a dinner at 's ; and then come home as cool and as easy as I use to be ; and find as sullen and silent , as be she custom , before tender himself to she ready acceptance . but I go to my spinnet , and suffer she to swell on . we have say nothing but and yes ever since ; and I wish I be with you for a month , and all they nonsense over without I . I be , my dear , oblige , and excellent , _you faithful and affectionate_ . the two follow anticipate the order of time , for the reason formerly mention , we insert here . * * * * * from to ._ my . , give my service to you . and tell he he be very impolite in he reflection upon I , as to , when he suppose I regret the loss of he . you be much more favourable and _just too , I will say , to you . these gentleman , the very best of they , be such indelicate ! they think so highly of they saucy self , and confident sex , as if a lady can not from _her_ heart despise they ; but if she turn they off , as they deserve , and continue she dislike , what should be interpret in she favour , as a just and _regular_ conduct , be turn against she , and it must proceed from spite . may think he know much of the sex . but be I as malicious as he be reflect ( and yet , if I have any malice , he have raise it ) , I could say , that he acquaintance , be not with the most unexceptionable , till he know you : and he have not long enough be happy in you , I find , to do justice to those who be proud to emulate you virtue . I say , , there can be no live with these man upon such beginning . they ought to know they distance , or be teach it , and not to think it in they power to confer that as a favour , which they should esteem it a honour to receive . but neither can I bear , it seem , the preparative to matrimony , the fine clothes , the compliment , the _busy novelty , as he call it , the new equipage , and so forth . that be he mistake again , tell he : for one who can look forwarder than the nine day of wonder , can easily despise so flashy and so transient a glare . and be I fond of compliment , it would not , perhaps , be the way to
to be pleased , in that respect , if I be to marry . compliment in the single state be a lady 's due , whether court or not ; and she receive , or ought always to receive they , as such ; but in courtship they be pour out upon one , like a hasty shower , soon to be over . a mighty comfortable consideration this , to a lady who _love to be compliment _! instead of the refresh - like shower , which beautify the sun -shine , she shall stand a deluge of complaisance , be wet to the skin with it ; and what then ? why be in a Lybian desert ever after !--experience a constant parching drink and all she attribute excellency will be swallow up in the quicksand of matrimony . it may be otherwise with you ; and it _must be so ; because there be such a infinite variety in you excellence . but do . think it must be so in _every matrimony ? ' tTis true , he improve every hour , as I see in he fine speech to you . but it could not be if he do not : you merit _extort it from he : and what a ungrateful , as well as absurd churl , would he be , who should seek to obscure a meridian lustre , that dazzle the eye of every one else ? I thank you for you delightful narrative , and beg you to continue they . I tell you how you 's conversation with , and you employment , charm we all : so regular , and so easy to be perform -- that be the delightful thing -- what every body may do ; - and yet so beautiful , so laudable , so uncommon in the practice , especially among people in genteel life ! -- you conversation and decision in relation to the two parson ( more than charm ) transport we . judge right , and act a charming part , to throw such a fine game into you hand . and so excellently do you play it , that you do as much credit to you partner 's judgment as to you own . never be so happy a couple . be more my favourite than ever ; and the amply rewarde , how do that scene affect we ! again and again , I say ( for what can I say else or more -- since I can not find word to speak all I think ? ) , you be a charming lady ! yet , methink , poor make but a sorry figure among you . we be delighted with ; but still more , if possible , with the countess : she be a fine lady , as you have draw she : but you character , though truth and nature , be the most shocking , or the most amiable , that I ever read . we be full of impatience to hear of the arrival of . we know he character pretty well : but when he have sit for it to you pencil , it must be a original indeed . I will have another trial with my papa , to move he to let I attend you . I be rally my force , and have get my mamma on my side again ; who be concerned to see she girl vex and insult by she younger sister ; and who yet mind no more what _she_ say to she , than what I say ; and love to make mischief between we , instead of interpose to silence either : and truly , I be afraid he delight of this kind will make he deny he what she so ardently wish for . I have a good mind to be sick , to be with you . I could fast two or three day , to give it the better appearance ; but then my mamma , who love not deceit , would blame I , if she know my stratagem ; and be grieved , if she think I be really ill . I know , fast , when one have a stomach to eat , give one a very gloomy and mortified air . what would I not do , in short , to procure to myself the inexpressible pleasure that I should have in you company and conversation ? but continue to write to I till then , however , and that will be next best _. I be _your most obliged and obedient_ POLLy Darnford . from the same . my , I be all over joy and rapture . my good papa permit I to say , that he will put he under you protection , when you go to . if you have but a _tenth part of the pleasure I have on this occasion , I be sure , I shall be as welcome as I wish . but he will insist upon it , he say , that sign some acknowledgment , which I be to carry along with _me_, that I be intrust to he honour and yours , and to be return to he _heart - whole_ and _dutiful , and with a reputation as unsullied as he receive I . but do continue you journal till then ; for I have promise to take they up where you leave off , to divert we friend here . there will be presumption ! but yet I will write nothing but what I will show you , and have you consent to send ! for I be teach early not to tell tale out of school ; and a school , the best I ever go to , will be you charming conversation . we be greatly divert with the trick put upon
upon that _barbarian_ . he obstinacy , repentance , and amendment , follow so irresistibly in one half hour , from the happy thought of the excellent lady countess , that I think no plot be ever more fortunate . it be like spring a lucky mine in a siege , that blow up twenty time more than be expect from it , and answer all the besieger 's end at once . .' defence of he own conduct towards you be quite noble ; and he judge with he usual generosity and good sense , when , by add to you honour , he know he enhance he own . you bid I skim over you writings lightly ; but ' tis impossible . I will not flatter you , my dear , nor will I be suspect to do so ; and yet I can not find word to praise , so much as I think you deserve : so I will only say that you good parent , for whose pleasure you write , as well as for mine , can not receive or read they with more delight than I do . even my sister ( judge of they effect by this ! ) will at any time leave , and forget to fry or be ill - natured , while she can hear read what you write . and , angry as she make I some time , I can not deny she this pleasure , because possibly , among the innumerable improve reflectiond they abound with , some one may possibly dart in upon she , and illuminate she , as you conversation and behaviour do . but you application in p.s. to my papa please he ; and confirm he resolution to let I go . he snatch the sheet that contain this , " that be to I , " say he : " I must read this myself . " he do , and say , " she be a sweet one : ' do dear good _, ' " repeat he aloud , " '_ let add to we delight !_' so she shall , then ; -- if that will do it !-- and yet this same . . have so many delights already , that I should think she might be contente . but , , I think I will let she go . these sister then , you will see , how they will love at a distance , though always quarrell when together . " he read on , " '_ the new affair will divert you -- have consent -- be willing ; and she sister can spare she ; '_-- very prettily put , faith -- '_ and do not you be cross _' -- very sweet ' _to deny I _.' -- why , dear , I will not be so cross then ; indeed I will not ! -- and so , Polly , let them send word when they set out for , and you shall join th'ey there with all my heart ; but I will have a letter every post , remember that , girl . " " any thing , any thing , dear papa , " say I : " so I can but go ! " he call for a kiss , for he compliance . I give it most willingly , you may believe . look envious , although come in just then . she look almost like a great glutton , whom I remember ; one , who kill himself with eat : he use , while he be heap up he plate from one dish , to watch the other , and follow the knife of every body else with such a greedy eye , as if he could swear a robbery against any one who presume to eat as well as he . well , let 's know when you set out , and you sha not have be a week in , if I can help it , but you shall be tell by my tongue , as now by my pen , how much I be _you oblige admirer and friend , Polly Darnford . my , I now proceed with my journal , which I have bring down to night . . the two lady resolve , as they say , to inspect all my proceedings , insist upon it , that I would take they with I in my _benevolent round ( as they , after we return , would call it ) , which I generally take once a week , among my poor and sick neighbour ; and find I could not get off , I set out with they , my lady countess propose to fill up the fourth place in the coach . we talk all the way of charity , and the excellence of that duty ; and my take notice of the text , that it would hide a _multitude of fault . the countess say she have once a much better opinion of herself , than she find she have reason for , within these _few_ day past : " and indeed , , " say she , " when I get home , I shall make a good many people the better for you example . " and so say ; which give I no small inward pleasure ; and I acknowledge , in suitable term , the honour they both do I . the coach set we down by the side of a large common , about five mile distant from we house ; and we alight , and walk a little way , choose not to have the coach come nearer , that we might be take as little notice of as possible ; and they enter with I into two mean cot with great condescension and goodness ;
; one belong to a poor widow and five child , who have be all down in ague and fevers ; the other to a man and he wife bed - rid with age and infirmity , and two honest daughter , one a widow with two child , the other marry to a husbandman , who have also be ill , but now , by comfortable cordial , and good physic , be pretty well to what they have be . the two lady be well pleased with my demeanour to the good folk : to whom I say , that as I should go so soon to , I be willing to see they before I go , to wish they better and better , and to tell they , that I should leave order with concern they , to whom they must make know they want : and that would take care of they , I be sure ; and do all that be in the power of physic for the restoration of they healt . now you must know , , that I be not so good as the old lady of former day , who use to distill cordial water , and prepare medicine , and dispense they themselves . I know , if I be so inclin , my dear . would not have be pleased with it , because in the approbation he have kindly give to my present method , he have twice or thrice praise I , that I do not carry my charity to extreme , and make he house a dispensatory . I would not , therefore , by aim at do too much , lose the opportunity of do any good at all in these respects ; and beside , as the vulgar say be , one must creep before one go . but this be my method : I be upon a agreement with this , who be deem a very skilful and honest apothecary , and one , a surgeon of like character , to attend to all such case and person as I shall recommend ; , to administer physic and cordial , as he shall judge proper , and even , in necessary case , to call in a physician . and now and then , by look in upon they one 's self , or send a servant to ask question , all be keep right . my observ a , a common prayer - book , and a of , in each cot , in leathern outside case , to keep they clean , and a church Catechism or two for the child ; and be pleased to say , it be right ; and she ladyship ask one of the child , a pretty girl , who lear not she she catechism ? and she curtsey would and look at I ; for I do ask the child question , when I come , to know how they improve ; " ' as I think , " say my lady ; " my sister provide for both part . bless you , my dear ! " say she , and tap my neck . my lady leave token of they bounty behind they to both family , and all the good folk bless and pray for we at part : and as we go out , my , with a serious air , be pleased to say to I , " take care of you health , my dear sister ; and give you , when it come , a happy hour : for how many real mourner would you have , if you be to be call early to reap the fruit of you piety ! " " 's will must be do , my lady , " say I . " the same Providence that have so wonderfully put it in my power to do a little good , will raise up new friend to the honest heart that rely upon he . " this I say , because some of the good people hear my lady , and seem trouble , and begin to redouble they prayer , for my safety and preservation . we walk thence to we coach , and stretch a little farther , to visit two farmers ' family , about a mile distant from each other . one have the mother of the family , with two son , just recover , the former from a fever , the latter from tertian ague ; and I ask , when they see ? they tell I , with great commendation of he , that he have but just leave they . so , have congratulate they hopeful way , and wish they to take care of themselves , and not go too early to business , I say I should desire to watch over they , for fear of a relapse , and should hardly see th'ey again for some time ; and so I slid , in a manner not to be observe , a couple of guinea into the good woman 's hand ; for I have a hint give I by , that they illness have make it low with they . we proceed then to the other farm , where the case be a married daughter , who have a very dangerous lying - in , and a wicked husband who have abuse she , and run away from she ; but she be mende apace , by good comfortable thing , which from time to time I have cause to be send she . she old father have be a little unkind to she , before I take notice of she ; for she marry against he consent ; and indeed the world go hard with the poor man , and he could not do much ; and besides ,
, he have a younger daughter , who have lose all she limb , and be force to be tie in a wicker chair , to keep she up in it ; which ( have expend much to relieve she ) be a great _pull - back , as the good old woman call it . and have be a year in arrear to a harsh landlord , who , find a good stock upon the ground , threaten to distress the poor family , and turn they out of all , I advance the money upon the stock ; and the poor man have already pay I half of it ( for , , I must keep within compass too ) , which be fifty pound at first , and be in a fair way to pay I the other half , and make as much more for himself . here I find , and he give I a account of the success of two other case I have recommend to he ; and tell I , that , a poor man , who , in thatch a barn , have tumble down , and break he leg , and bruise himself all over , be in a fair way of recovery . this poor creature have like to have perish by the cruelty of the parish officer , who would have pass he away to , where he settlement be , though in a burn fever , occasion by he misfortune ; but hearing of the case , I direct to attend he , and to provide for he at my expense , and give my word , if he die , to bury he . I be glad to hear he be in so good a way , and tell , I hope to see he and together at . , before I set out for , that we might advise about the case under they direction , and that I might acquit myself of some of my obligation to they . " you be a good man , , " add I : " will bless you for you care and kindness to these poor destitute creature . they all praise you , and do nothing but talk of you humanity to they . " " of my good lady , " say he , " who can forbear follow such a example as you set ? can testify as well as I ( for now and then a case require we to visit together ) that we can hardly hear any complaint from we poor patient , let th'ey be ever so ill , for the praise and blessing they bestow upon you . " " it be good that enable and encourage I to do what I do . tell they , they must bless , and bless he , and pray for I , and thank you and Simmonds : we all join together , you know , for they good . " the countess and ask the poor lie - in woman many question , and leave with she , and for she poor sister , a miserable object indeed !--( be praise that I be not such a one ! ) marnks of they bounty in gold , and look upon one another , and then upon I , and lift up they hand , could not say a word till we be in the coach : and so we be carry home , after we have just look in upon a country school , where I pay for the learning of eight child . and here ( I hope I recite not this with pride , though I do with pleasure ) be a cursory account of my _benevolent weekly round , as my lady will call it . I know you will not be displease with it ; but it will highly delight my worthy parent , who , in they way , do a great deal of discreet good in they neighbourhood : for indeed , , a little matter , _prudently bestowed , and on true object of compassion ( whose case be soon at a crisis , as be those of most labouring people ) , will go a great way , and especially if lay out properly for th'ey , accord to the exigency of they respective case .-- for such poor people , who live generally low , want very seldom any thing but revive cordial at first , and good wholesome kitchen physic afterwards : and then the wheel of nature , be unclogged , new oile , as it be , and set right , they will go round again with pleasantness and ease for a good while together , by virtue of that exercise which they labour give they ; while the rich and voluptuous be force to undergo great fatigue to keep theirs clean and in order . Saturday morning . it be hardly right to trouble either of you , my honoured correspondent , with a affair that have vex I a good deal ; and , indeed , _should affect I more than any other mistress of a family , for reason which will be obvious to you , when I tell you the case . and this I can not forbear do . a pretty genteel young body , my , as I call she , have be well recommend , and behave with great prudence till this time , be the cause . my dear . and the two lady , agree with I to take a little airing in the coach , and to call in upon , who have a present make he for he menagerie , in which he take a great delight , of a rare and uncommon creature , a native of the . but just as be on horseback to accompany
accompany they , and the lady be ready to go , I be take with a sudden disorder and faintishness ; so that , who be very tender of I , and watch every change of my countenance , would not let I go with they , though my disorder be go off : and my dear be pleased to excuse I ; and just meet with , as they go to the coach , they take he with they , to fill up the vacant place . so I retire to my closet , and shut myself in . they have ask to go with they , for company to ; but he ( on purpose , as I believe by what follow ) could not be find , when they set out : so they suppose he be upon some ramble with , he great favourite . I be write to you , be pretty well recover , when I hear Polly , as I suppose , and as it prove , come into my apartment : and down she sit , and sung a little catch , and cry , " ! " twice ; and presently I hear two voice . but suspect nothing , I write on , till I hear a kind of rustling and struggle , and 's voice cry , " -- how can you do so !-- pray , . " this alarm I much , because we have such orderly folk about we ; and I look through the key - hole ; and , to my surprise and concern , see .--foolish gentleman !-- take libertie with , that neither become he to offer , nor , more foolish girl ! she to suffer . and have reason to think , that this be not their first interview , and freedom -- and the girl sometimes encouragingly laugh , as at other time , inconsistently , struggle and complain , in a accent that be too tender for the occasion , I force a faint cough . this fright they both : swore , and say , " who can that be ?-- you lady be go with they , be not she ? " " I believe so !-- I hope so ! " say the silly girl --" yet that be like she voice ! -- , be you in you closet , I be ? " say she , come up to the door ; stand like a poor thief , half behind the window - curtain , till he know whether it be I . I open the door : away sneak , and she leape with surprise , not hope to find I there , though she ask the question . " I think -- indeed -- I be -- I think you be go out , " -- " it be plain you do , . -- go and shut the chamber door , and come to I again . " she do , but tremble , and be so full of confusion , that I pitie the poor creature , and hardly know how to speak to she . for my compassion get the upper hand of my resentment ; and as she stand quaking and trembling , and look on the ground with a countenance I can not describe , I now and then cast my eye upon she , and be as often force to put my handkerchief to it . at last I say , " how long have these freedom past between you and .?-- I be loth to be censorious , Polly ; but it be too plain , that . would not have follow you into my chamber , if he have not meet you at other place . " -- the poor girl say never a word .--" do I expect , Polly , that you would have shewn so much imprudence . you have have instance of the vile art of man against poor maiden : have you any notion that intend to do honourably by you ? " --" I be -- I be -- I believe -- I hope -- I dare say , would not do otherwise . " -- " so much the worse that you believe so , if you have not very good reason for you belief . do he pretend that he will marry you ? " -- she be silent .-- " tell I , Polly , if he do ? " --" he say he will do honourably by I ."--" but you know there be but one word necessary to explain that other precious word _honour , in this case . it be _matrimony . that word be as soon speak as any other , and if he _mean it , he will not be shy to _speak_ it . " -- she be silent .-- " tell I , Polly ( for I be really greatly concerned for you ) , what you think _yourself ; do you _hope_ he will marry you ? " -- she be silent .-- " do , good ( I hope I may call you _good yet ! ) , answer I . " -- " pray , Madam ! " and she weep , and turn from I , to the wainscot -- " pray , excuse I . " --" but , indeed , Polly , I can not _excuse_ you . you be under my protection . I be once in as dangerous a situation as you can be in . and I do not escape it , child , by the language and conduct I hear from you . " --" language and conduct , I be ! " --" yes , Polly , language and conduct . do you think , if I have set I down in my lady 's bed -
- chamber , sung a song , and hemm would twice , and come to I , upon that signal ( for such I doubt it be ) , I have keep my place , and suffer myself to be rumple , and only , in a soft voice , and with a encouraging laugh , cry --' how can you do so ? ' that I should have be what I be ?"--" I be , I dare say , my lord " ( so all the servants call he , and he aunt often , when she put to it ) , " mean no hurt . " -- " no hurt , Polly ! what , and make you cry ' !_' - or do you intend to trust you honour to he mercy , rather than to you own discretion ? " --" I hope not , I be ! " --" I hope not too , Polly ! -- but you know he be free enough with you , to make you say ' !_' and what might have be the case , who know ? have I not cough on purpose : unwilling , for you sake , , to find matter so bad as I fear , and that you would have be lead beyond what be reputable . " " reputable , I be ! " --" yes , Polly : I be sorry you oblige I to speak so plain . but you good require it . instead of fly from he , you not only laugh when you cry out , ' !_' and '_ how can you do so ?_' but have no other care than to see if any body hear you ; and you observe how he slid away , like a guilty creature , on my open the door -- do these thing look well , ? do you think they do ?--And if you hope to emulate my good fortune , do you think _this_ be the way ? " " I wish , , I have never see . for nobody will look upon I , if I lose you favour ! " " it will still , " ( and I take she hand , with a kind look ) , " be in you power to keep it : I will not mention this matter , if you make I you friend , and tell I all that have pass . " -- again she weep , and be silent .-- this make I more uneasy .-- " do not think , Polly , " say I , " that I would envy any other person 's preferment , when I have be so much exalt myself . if . have talk to you of marriage , tell I . " -- " no , Me'm , I can not say he have _yet _. " --" yet , Polly ! then he _never _. will . for when man do talk of it , they do not always _mean_ it : but whenever they _mean_ it , how can they confirm a doubting maiden , without _mention it : but alas for you , poor !-- the freedom you have permit , no doubt , previous to those I hear , and which might have be greater , have I not surprise you with my cough , shew too well , that he _need not make any promise to you . " --" indeed , I be , " say she , sobb , " I might be too little upon my guard ; but I would not have do any ill for the world . " " I hope you would not , Polly ; but if you suffer these freedom , you can not tell what you would have permit -- tell I , do you love h.? " " he be very good - humour , Madam , and be not proud . " -- " no , ' tis not he business to be proud , when he hope to humble you -- humble you , indeed !-- beneath the lowest person of the sex , that be honest . " --" I hope ----" --" you _hope !_ " interrupt I . " you _hope_ too much ; and I _fear a great deal for you , because you fear so _litle for yourself . -- but say , how often have you be in private together ? " " in private , I be ! I do not know what you ladyship call _private !_" --" why that be _private , Polly , when , as just now , you neither imagine nor intend any body should see you . " she be silent ; and I see by this , poor girl , how true lover be to they secret , though , perhaps , they ruin depend upon keep it . but it behove I , on many account , to examine this matter narrowly ; because if should marry she , it would have be laid upon . 's example . -- and if be ruin , it would be a sad thing , and people would have say , " aye , she could take care enough of herself , but none at all of she servant : _her_ wait -maid have a much more remiss mistress than found , or the matter would not have be thus . " " well , Polly , I see , " continue I , " that you will not speak out to I . you may have _several_ reason for it , possibly , though not _one_ good one . but as soon as come in , who have a great concern in this matter , as well as , and be answerable to Lord in a matter of so much importance as this
this , I will leave it to she ladyship 's consideration , and shall no more concern myself to ask you question about it -- for then I must take she ladyship 's direction , and part with you , to be sure . " the poor girl , fright at this ( for every body fear Lady Davers ) , wring she hand , and beg , for 's sake , I would not acquaint Lady Davers with it . " but how can I help it ? -- must I not connive at you proceedings , if I do not ? you be no fool , Polly , in other case . tell I , how it be possible for I , in my situation , to avoid it ? " " I will tell you ladyship the whole truth ; indeed I will -- if you will not tell Lady Davers . I be ready to sink at the thought of Lady Davers know any thing of this . " this look sadly . I pitie she , but yet be angry in my mind ; for I see , too plainly , that she conduct could not bear a scrutiny , not even in _her own _opinion , poor creature . I say , " make I acquaint with the whole . " -- " will you ladyship promise --" --" I will promise nothing , Polly . when I have hear all you think proper to say , I will do what befit I to do ; but with as much tenderness as I can for you -- and that be all you ought to expect I to promise . " --" why then , Madam -- but how can I speak it ?-- I can speak sooner to any body , than to and you , Madam : for she ladyship 's passion , and you ladyship 's virtue -- how shall I ?" -- and then she throw herself at my foot , and hide she face with she apron . I be in agony for she , almost ; I weep over she , and raise she up , and say , " tell I all . you can not tell I worse than I apprehend , nor I hope so bad ! of Polly , tell I soon .-- for you give I great pain . " and my back , with grief and compassion for the poor girl , be ready to open , as it see to I .-- in my former distress , I have be overcome by fainting next to death , and be deprive of sense for some moment -- but else , I imagine , I must have feel some such affecting sensation , as the unhappy girl 's case give I . " then , , I own , " say she , " I have be too faulty . " -- " as how ?-- as what ?-- in what way ? --How faulty ? " --ask I , as quick as think : " you be not ruin , be you ?-- tell I , Polly ! " -- " no , Madam , but --" --" but what ? --Say , but what ? " --" I have consent --" -- " to what ? " --" to he proposal , . " -- " what proposal ? " --" why , Madam , I be to live with . " " I understand you too well -- but be it too late to break so wretch a bargain ; -- have you already make a sacrifice of you honour ? " " no , Madam : but I have give it under my hand . " " under you _hand !_-- ah ! Polly , it be well if you have not give it under you _heart too . but what foolishness be this ! -- what consideration have he make you ?" --" he have give it under he hand , that he will always love I ; and when he lordship 's father die , he will own I . " " what foolishness be this on both side ! -- but be you willing to be release from this bargain ? " " indeed I be . madam , and I tell he so yesterday . but he say he will sue I , and ruin I , if I do not stand to it . " " you be ruin if you do !-- and I wish -- but tell I , Polly , be you not ruin as it be ? " " indeed I be not , . " " I doubt , then , you be upon the brink of it , have not this providential indisposition keep I at home .-- you meet , I suppose , to conclude you shocking bargain .-- of poor unhappy girl ! -- but let I see what he have give under he hand ! " " he have 'em both , madam , to be draw up fair , and in a strong hand , that shall be like a record . " could I have think , , that a girl of nineteen could be so ignorant in a point so important , when in every thing else she have shew no instance like this stupid folly ? " have he give you money ? " " yes , Madam , he give I -- he give I -- a note . here it be . he say any body will give I money for it . " and this be a bank note of fifty pound , which she pull out of she stay . the result be , he be to settle one hundred pound a year upon she and hers , poor , poor girl -- and be to _own_ she ,
, as he call it ( but as wife or mistress , she stipulate not ) , when he father die , and he come into the title and estate . I tell she , it be impossible for I to conceal the matter from , if she would not , by she promise to be govern entirely by I , and to abandon all thought of , give I room to conclude , that the wicked bargain be at a end . and to keep the poor creature in some spirit , and to enable she to look up , and to be more easy under my direction , I blame _him_ more than I do _her : though , consider what virtue require of a woman , and custom have make shameless in a man , I think the poor girl inexcusable , and shall not be easy while she be about I . for she be more to blame , because , of the two , she have more wit than the man . " but what can I do ? " thing I . " if I put she away , ot will be to throw she directly into he hand . he will not stay here long : and she _may see she folly . but yet she eye be open ; she know what she have to trust to -- and by they wicked begin , and she encourage repulse , I doubt she would have be utterly ruin that very day . " I know the rage lady Davers would be in with both . so this be another embarrassment . yet should my good intentions fail , and they conclude they vile bargain , and it appear that I know of it , but would not acquaint she , then should I have be more blame than any mistress of a family , circumstance as I be . upon the whole , I resolve to comfort the girl as well as I could , till I have gain she confidence , that my advice might have the more weight , and , by degree , be more likely to reclaim she : for , poor soul ! there would be a end of she reputation , the most precious of all jewel , the moment the matter be know ; and that would be a sad thing . as for the man , I think it best to take courage ( and you , that know I , will say , I must have a good deal more than usual ) to talk to on this subject . and she consent I should , and , with great protestation , declare she sorrow and repentance , beg to get she note of hand again , and to give he back he note of fifty pound , I go down to find he . he shunn I , as a thief would a constable at the head of a hue - and - cry . as I enter one room , he go into another , look with conscious guilt , yet confidently hum a tune . at last I fix he , bid tell Polly be want to send a message by she to she lady . by which I doubt not he be desirous to know what she have own , in order to govern himself accordingly . he back be towards I ; and I say -- " , here I be myself , to take you command . " he give a caper half a yard high -- " madam , I want -- I want to speak to -- I would have speak with -- " " you want to send Polly to I , perhaps , , to ask if I would take a little walk with you in the garden . " " very true , Madam !-- very true indeed !-- you have guess the matter . I think it be pity , this fine day , as every body be take airing -- " " well then . , please to lead the way , and I will attend you . " " yet I fancy , Madam , the wind be a little too high for you .-- will not you catch cold ? " --" no , never fear , , I be not afraid of a little air . " " I will attend you presently , madam : you will be in the great gravel walk , or on the terrace . -- I will wait upon you in a instant . " I have the courage to take hold of he arm , as if I have like to have slipt .-- , think I , thou shal not see the girl till I have talk to thee a little , if thou dost then .-- " excuse I , .-- I hope I have not hurt my foot -- I must lean upon you . " " will you be pleased , Madam , to have a chair ? I fear you have sprain you foot .-- shall I help you to a chair ? " " no , no , , I shall walk it off , if I hold by you . " so he have no excuse to leave I , and we proceed into the garden . but never do any thing look so like a _foolish fellow , as he aunt call he . he look , if possible , half a dozen way at once , hemm ' , cough , turn he head behind he every now and then , start half a dozen silly subject , in hope to hinder I from speaking . I appear , I believe , under some concern how to begin with he ; for he would have it I be not very well , and
and beg he might step in one minute to desire to attend I . so I resolve to begin with he ; lest I should lose the opportunity , see my eel so very slippery . and place myself on a seat , ask he to sit down . he decline , and would wait upon I presently , he say , and seem to be go . so I begin -- " it be easy for I , , to penetrate into the reason why you be so willing to leave I : but ' tis for you own sake , that I desire you to hear I , that no mischief may ensue among friend and relation , on a occasion to which you be no stranger . " " o , , what can you mean ? surely , Madam , you do not think amiss of a little innocent liberty , or so ! " " , " reply I , " I want not any evidence of you inhospitable design upon a poor unwary young creature , whom you birth and quality have find it too easy a task to influence . " " _Inhospitable designs _! Madam !-- a harsh word ! you very nice lady can not admit of the least freedom in the world !-- why , Madam , I have kiss ' a lady 's woman before now , in a civil way or so , and never be call to a account for it , as a breach of hospitality . " " not for I , , to proceed to _very nice _particular with a gentleman who can act as you have do , by a poor girl , that dare not have look up to a man of you quality , have you not level all distinction between you in order to level the weak creature to the common dirt of the highway . I must say , that the poor girl heartily repent of she folly ; and , to show you , that it signify nothing to deny it , she beg you will return the note of she hand you extort from she foolishness ; and I hope you will be so much of a gentleman , as not to keep in you power such a testimony of the weakness of any of the sex . " " have she tell you that , ?-- why , may be -- indeed -- I can not but say -- , it may not look so well to you , Madam : but young folk will have frolic . it be nothing but a frolic . let I _be hang , if it be ! " " be pleased then , , to give up she note to I , to return to she . reputation should not be frolick with , ; especially that of a poor girl , who have nothing else to depend upon . " " I will give it she myself , if you please , Madam , and laugh at she into the bargain . why , ' ttis comical enough , if the little pug thought I be earnest , I must have a laugh or two at she , Madam , when I give it she up . " " , ' tis but a frolic , , you will not take it amiss , that when we be set down to supper , we call Polly in , and demand a sight of she note , and that will make every one merry as well as you . " " not so , , that may not be so well neither ! for , perhaps , they will be apt to think it be in earnest ; when , as I hope to live , ' tis but a jest : nothing in the world else , upon honou ! " I put on then a still more serious air -- " as you _hope to live , say you , .!-- and _upon you honour !_ how ! fear you not a instant punishment for this appeal ? and what be the _honour_ you swear by ? take that , and answer I , Sir : do gentleman give away bank - note for _frolic , and for _mere jest , and _nothing in the world else !-- I be sorry to be oblige to deal thus with you . but I think I be talk to a gentleman who would not forfeit he veracity ; and that in so solemn a instance as this ! " he look like a man thunderstruck . he face be distort , and he head seem to turn about upon he neck , like a weather - cock in a hurricane , to all point of the compass ; he hand clench as in a passion , and yet shame and confusion struggle in every limb and feature . at last he say , " I be confoundedly betrayed . but if I be expose to my uncle and aunt " ( for the wretch think of nobody but himself ) , " I be undone , and shall never be able to look they in the face . ' tTis true , I have a design upon she ; and since she have betraye I , I think I may say , that she be as willing , almost , as I . " " Ungenerous , contemptible wretch ! " think I -- " but such of we sex as can thus give up they virtue , ought to expect no better : for he that stick not at _one_ bad action , will not scruple at _another to vindicate himself : and so , - like , become the attempter and the accuser too ! " " but if you will be so good , " say he
he , with hand uplift , " as to take no notice of this to my uncle , and especially to my aunt and , I swear to you , I never will think of she as long as I live . " " and you will bind this promise , will you , , by _your honour , and as you _hope to live ?_ " " dear , good madam , forgive I , I beseech you ; do not be so severe upon I . by all that be -- " " do not swear , . but as a earnest that I may believe you , give I back the girl 's foolish note , that , though ' tis of no significance , she may not have that to witness she folly . " -- he take out he pocket - book : " there it be , ! and I beg you will forgive this attempt : I see I ought not to have make it . I doubt it be a breach of the law of hospitality , as you say . but to make it know , will only expose I , and it can do no good ; and . will perhaps resent it ; and my aunt will never let I hear the last of it , nor my uncle neither -- and I shall be send to travel again -- and " ( add the poor creature ) " I be once in a storm , and the cross the sea again would be death to I . " " what a wretch art thou ! " think I . " what could such a one as thou find to say , to a poor creature that , if put in the scale against considerations of virtue , should make the latter kick the [ 's note : illegible ] " poor , poor ! thou be sink indeed ! too low for excuse , and almost beneath pity ! " I tell he , if I could observe that nothing pass between they , that should lay I under a necessity of reveal the matter , I should not be forward to expose he , nor the maiden either : but that he must , in he own judgment , excuse I , if I make every body acquaint with it , if I be to see the correspondence between they likely to be renew or carry on : " , " add I , " in that case I should owe it to myself , to , to and , and to you , and the unhappy body too , to do so . " he would need drop down on one knee , to promise this ; and with a thousand acknowledgment , leave I to find , in order to ride to meet the coach on its return . I go in , and give the foolish note to the silly girl , which she receive eagerly , and immediately burnt ; and I tell she , I would not suffer she to come near I but as little as possible , when I be in company while staid ; but consign she entirely to the care of , to whom only , I say , I would hind the matter as tenderly as I could : and for this , I add , I have more reason than one ; first , to give she the benefit of a good gentlewoman 's advice , to which i have myself formerly be beholden , and from whom I conceal nothing ; next , to keep out of . way ; and lastly that I might have a opportunity , from 's opinion , to judge of the sincerity of she repentance : " for , , " say I , " you must imagine , so regular and uniform as all we family be , and so good as I think all the people about I be , that I could not suspect , that she , the duty of whose place make she nearest to my person , be the farthest from what I wish . " I have set this matter so strongly before she , and have so well second I , that I hope the best ; for the grief the poor creature carry in she look , and express in she word , can not be describe ; frequently accuse herself , with tear , say often to , she be not worthy to stand in the presence of she mistress , whose example she have make so bad a use of , and whose lesson she have so ill follow . I be sadly troublead at this matter , however ; but I take great comfort in reflect that my sudden indisposition look like a providential thing , which may save one poor soul , and be a seasonable warning to she , as long as she life . meantime I must observe , that at supper last night , look abject and mean , and like a poor thief , as I think , and conscious of he disappoint folly ( though I seldom glance my eye upon he ) , have less to say for himself than ever . and once my Lady Davers , laugh , say , " I think in my heart , my nephew look more foolish every time I see he , than the last . " he steal a look at I , and blush ; and my lord say , " have some grace ! he blush ! hold up thy head , nephew ! Hast thou nothing at all to say for thyself ? " say , " a blush become a young gentleman ! I never see one before though , in .-- what be the matter , ?
? " --" only , " say , " he skin or he conscience be mende , that be all . " " thank you , Madam , " be all he say , bow to he aunt , and affect a careless yet confused air , as if he whisper a whistle . " o , wretch ! " think I , " see what it be to have a condemning conscience ; while every _innocent person look round easy , smile , and erect ! " -- but yet it be not the shame of a bad action , I doubt , but be discover and disappoint , that give he he confusion of face . what a sad thing for a person to be guilty of such action , as shall put it in the power of another , even by a look , to mortify he ! and if poor soul can be thus abjectly strike at such a discovery by a fellow -creature , how must they appear before a unerring and omniscient judge , with a conscience stand in the place of a thousand witness ? and call in vain upon the _mountain to fall upon they , and the _hill to cover they !_-- how serious this subject make one ! . I be just retir from a fatiguing service ; for who should come to dine with but that sad rake ; and , , and , three as bad as himself ; inseparable companion , whose whole delight be drink , hunt , and lewdness ; but otherwise gentleman of wit and large estate . three of they break in upon we at the , on the happiest day of my life , to we great regret ; and they have be long threaten to make this visit , in order to see I , as they tell . they whipt out two bottle of champagne instantly , for a whet , as they call it ; and go to view the stud and the kennel , and then walk in the garden till dinner be ready ; my , and , as well as . ( for they be all acquaint ) accompany they . , it seem , as tell I afterwards ; say , he longe to see . . she be the talk wherever he go , and he have conceive a high opinion of she beforehand . Davers say , " I defy you , gentlemen , to think so highly of she as she deserve , take mind and person together . " say , he never see any woman yet , who come up to what he expect , where fame have be lavish in she praise . " but how , brother baronet , " say to , " come _you_ to be reconcile to she ? I hear that you would never own she . " " Oon man ! " say , " I be take in .-- they contrive to clap she upon I as and pretend they would keep t'other out of my sight ; and I be plaguily bit , and force to get on as well as I could . " " that be a bite indeed , " say ; " and so you fall a praising , I warrant , to the sky . " " ye -- s " ( draw out the affirmative monosyllable ) , " I be use most scurvily : faith I be . I bear th'ey a grudge for it still , I can tell 'em that ; for I have hardly be able to hold up my head like a man since -- but be force to go and come , and to do as they bid I . by my troth , I never be so manageable in my life . " " you Herefordshire neighbour , , " say , with a oath , " will rejoice to hear this ; for the whole county there can not manage you . " " I be quite cow would now , as you will see by - and - by ; nay , for that matter , if you can set . . a talking , not one of you all will care to open you lip , except to say as she say . " " never fear , old boy , " say , " we will bear we part in conversation . I never see the woman yet , who could give I either awe or love for six minute together . what think you , b.? have you any notion , that you lady will have so much power over we ? " " I think , , I have one of the finest woman in ; but I neither expect nor desire you rake should see she with my eye . " " you know , if I have a mind to love she , and make court to she too , , I will : and I be half in love with she already , although I have not see she . " they come in when dinner be near ready , and the four gentleman take each a large bumper of old hock for another whet . the countess , , and I come down together . the gentleman know we two noble lady , and be know to they in person , as well as by character . , in he usual kind and encourage manner , take my hand , and present the four gentleman to I , each by he name . Sir Charles say , pretty bluntly , that he hope he be more welcome to I now , than the last time he be under the same roof with I ; for he have be tell since , that that be we happy day . I
I say , . friend be always welcome to I . " Tis well , , " say , " we do not know how it be . we should have quarter ourselves upon for a week together , and keep he up day and night . " I think this speech deserve no answer , especially as they be gentleman who want no countenance , and address myself to , who be always kindly make court to I : " I hope , my good lord , you find yourself quite recover of you head - ache ? " ( of which he complain at breakfast ) . " I thank you , my dear sister , pretty well . " " I be tell and the other gentleman , niece , " say , " how I be cheat here , when I come first , with a . " " it be a very lucky cheat for I , ; for it give you a prepossession in my favour under so advantageous a character , that I could never have expect otherwise . " " I wish , " say the countess , " my daughter , for whom take you , have . B . 's quality to boast of . " --" how be I oblige to you ladyship 's goodness , " return I , " when you treat I with even greater indulgence than you use to so belove a daughter ! " " Nay , now you talk of treating , " say , " when , lady , will you treat we sex with the politeness which you show to one another ? " " when you sex deserve it , , " answer . " who be to be judge of that ? " say . " not the gentleman , I hope , " reply my lady . " well then , , " say , " we bespeak you good opinion of _us ; for you have _our _. " " I be oblige to you , gentleman ; but I must be more cautious in declare _mine , lest it should be think I be influence by you kind , and perhaps too hasty , opinion of I . " Sir Charles swore they have _seen_ enough of I the moment I enter the parlour , and hear enough the moment I open my lip to answer for _their_ opinion of I . I say , I make no doubt , when _they have as good a subject to expatiate upon , as I have , in the pleasure before I , of see so many agreeable friend of . , they would maintain the title they claim of every one 's good opinion . " this , " say , " be bind you over , gentlemen , to you good behaviour . you must know , my niece never shoot fly , as _you_ do . " the gentleman laugh : " be it shoot fly , , " return , " to praise that lady ? " " ads - bud , I do not think of that . " " , " say the countess , " you need not be at a fault ; -- for a good sportsman always hit he mark , fly or not ; and the gentleman have so fair a one , that they could not well miss it . " " you be fairly help over the stile , , " say . " and , indeed , I want it ; though I lim like a puppy before I be lame . one can not think of every thing as one use to do at you time of life , gentlemen . " this flippant stuff be all that pass , which I _can_ recite ; for the rest , at table , and after dinner , be too polite by half for I ; such as , the quantity of wine each man could _carry off ( that be the phrase ) , dog , horse , hunt , racing , cock -fighting , and all accompany with swearing and cursing , and that in good humour , and out of wantonness ( the least excusable and more profligate sort of swear and curse of all ) . the gentleman like the wine so well , that we have the felicity to drink tea and coffee by ourselves ; only . ( upon we invite the gentleman to partake with we ) slide in for a few minute to tell we , they would stick by what they have , and take a dish of coffee with we . I should not omit one observation ; that , when they be go , say they be _pure company ; and that he never be so delighted in he _born day _.-- While the two lady put up they prayer , that they might never have such another entertainment . and be encourage by they declaration , I presume to join in the same petition . yet it seem , these be man of wit ! I believe they must be so -- for I could neither like nor understand they . yet , if they conversation have much wit , I should think my lady would have find it out . the gentleman , permit I to add , go away very merry , to ride ten mile by owl - light ; for they would not accept of bed here . they have two french horns with they , and give we a flourish or two at go off . each have a servant besides : but the way they be in would have give I more concern than it do , have they be related to and less used to it . and , indeed , it be a happiness , that such
such gentleman take no more care than they generally do , to interest any body intimately in they healt and preservation ; for these be all single man . need the public , any more than the private , be much concerned about they ; for let such person go when they will , if they continue single , they next here can not well be a worse commonwealth 's man ; and there be a great chance he may be better . you know I end my seriously . and this , to what I have already say , make I add , that I can not express how much I be , my dear , _your faithful and affectionate_ from to . in answer to and ._ my , I skip over the little transaction of several day , to let you know how much you rejoice I , in tell I have be so kind as to comply with my wish . both you most agreeable letter come to my hand together , and I thank you a hundred time for they ; and I thank you dear mamma , and too , for the pleasure they have give I in this obliging permission . how happy shall we be !-- but how long will you be permit to stay , though ? all the winter , I hope :-- and then , when that be over , let we set out together , if shall spare we , directly for ; and to pass most of the summer likewise in each other 's company . what a sweet thought be this !-- let I indulge it a little while . read you letter , and say , you be a charming young lady , and surpass yourself in every letter . I tell he , that he be more interested in the pleasure I take in this favour of 's than he imagine . " as how , my dear ? " say he . " a plain case , , " reply I : " for endeavouring to improve myself by 's conversation and behaviour , I shall every day be more worthy of you favour . " he kindly would have it , that nobody , no , not herself , excel I . ' right , you know , , that should think so , though I must know nothing at all , if I be not sensible how inferior I be to my dear : and yet , when I look abroad now - and - then , I could be a proud slut , if I would , and not yield the palm to many other . well , my dear , be past and gone , as happy as the last ; the two lady , and , at _their_ earnest request , bear we company , in the evening part . my Polly be there morning and evening , with she heart break almost , poor girl !-- I put she in a corner of my closet , that she concern should not be mind . give I great hope of she . be much pleased with we family order , and say , ' tbe no wonder I keep so good myself , and make other so : and he think the four rake ( for he run on how much they admire I ) would be convert , if they see how well I pass my time , and how cheerful and easy every one , as well as myself be under it ! he say , when he come home , he must take such a method himself in _his_ family ; for , he believe , it would make not only better master and mistress , but better child , and better servants too . but , poor gentleman ! he have , I doubt , a great deal to mmend in _himself , before he can begin such a practice with efficacy in he _family . Monday . in the afternoon . take he leave of we , highly satisfied with we both , and _particularly ( so he say ) with I ; and promise that my two cousin , as he call he daughter , and he sister , a old maiden lady , if they go to tow this winter , should visit I , and be improve by I ; that be he word . accompany he some mile on he journey , and the two lady , and , and I , take a airing in the coach . be so kind as to tell I , when he come home , with a whisper , that present she duty to I . I have get a multitude of fine thing for the dear little creature , and promise to give I a dairy - house breakfast , when we guest be gone . I enclose the history of this little charmer , by . consent , since you be to do we the honour , as he ( as well as I ) pleases himself , to be one of we family -- but keep it to yourself , whatever you do . I be guarantee that you will ; and have put it in a separate paper , that you may burn it when read . for I may want you advice on this subject , have a great desire to get this child in my possession ; and yet have give a hint , that dwell a little with I . when I have the pleasure I hope for , I will lay all before you , and be determine , and proceed , as far as I have power , by you . you , my good father and mother , have see the story in my former papers . Tuesday . you must know ,
, I pass over the day thus swiftly , not that I could not fill they up with writing , as amply as I have do the former ; but intend only to give you a general idea of we way of life and conversation ; and have go through a whole week and more , you will be able , from what I have recit , to form a judgment how it be with we , one day with another . as for example , now and then neighbourly visit receive and pay -- Needlework between whiles -- music -- card sometimes , though I do not love they -- one more benevolent round -- improve conversation with my dear . and my two good lady -- a lesson from he , when alone , either in or -- a new pauper case or two -- a visit from the good dean -- 's departure , in order to put the new project alteration in force , which be to deprive I of my chaplain --( by the way , the dean be highly pleased with this affair , and the motive to it , be a favourite of he , and a distant relation of he lady ) -- . h . and 's mutual endeavour to avoid one another -- my lesson to the poor girl , and caution , as if she be my sister -- these , my dear , and my honoured parent , be the pleasant employment of we time ; so far as we female be concerned : for the gentleman hunt , ride out , and divert themselves in they way , and bring we home the news and occurrences they meet with abroad , and now - and - then a straggling gentleman they pick up in they diversion . and so I shall not enlarge upon these article , after the tedious specimen I have already give . , . could you ever have thought , my dear , that husband have a dispensing power over they wife , which king be not allow over the law ? I have have a smart debate with , and I fear it will not be the only one upon this subject . can you believe , that if a wife think a thing she duty to do , which she husband do not approve , he can dispense with she perform it , and no sin shall lie at she door ? maintain this point . I have great doubt about it ; particularly one ; that if a matter be my duty , and he dispense with my performance of it , whether , even although that be to clear _me_ of the sin , it will not fall upon _himself ? and a good wife would be as much concerned at this , as if it be to remain upon _her _. yet he seem set upon it . what can one do ? -- do you ever hear of such a notion , before ? of such a prerogative in a husband ? would you care to subscribe to it ? he say , the lady be of he opinion . I be afraid they be , and so will not ask they . but , perhaps , I may not live , and other thing may happen ; and so I will say no more of it at present . . and my and and the excellent Countess of have leave we this day , to we mutual regret , the former put the follow letter into my hand , with a air of respect and even reverence . he say , he spell most lamentably ; and this oblige I to give it you _literally : " Deare , " I cannott contente myself with common thankes , on leave your , and . hospitabel house , because of _thatt there affaire , which I neede not mention ! and truly be _asham to mention , as I _have be to loeak you in the face ever since it happen ' .

" this be the whole truthe , and all the intimasy we ever hadde , to _speake off _. but I beleefe we should have be better acquaint , hadd you nott , luckily _for mee _! prevent itt , by be at home , when we think you abroad . for I be to come to she when shee hemm have _two or three time ; for have make a contract , you knowe . , it be naturall enough to take the first occasion to putt itt in force . " poor Polley ! I pity she too . do not thinke the worse of she , deare Madam , so as to turn she away , because it may bee she ruin . I do not desire to see she . I might have be _drawne_ _in_ to do strange foolish thing , and be ruin would at the long run ; for who know where this

" butt cann you forgive I ? you see how happy I be in my disappointment . I do nott think too write so much ; -- for I do not love it : but on this occasion , know not how too leave off . I hope you can read my letter . I know I write a _clumsy hand , and _spelle most lamentabelly ; for I never have a tallent for these thing . I be readier by half to admire the _orcherd rob picture _in 's grammar , then any other part of the book . " but , hey , whether be I run ! I never writt to you before , and never may again , unless you , or command it , for you service . so pray excuse I , Madam .

" well , , what shall we say to this fine letter ? -- you will allow it to be a original , I hope . yet , may - be not . for it may be as well write , and as sensible a letter as this class of people generally write ! dress well , be not a contemptible figure of a man , laugh , talk , where he can be hear , and he aunt be not present ; and _cut , to use he own word , a considerable figure in a country town .-- but see -- yet I will not say what I might -- he be 's nephew ; and if he make he _observation , and _forbear he _speech ( I mean , can be silent , and only laugh when he see somebody of more sense laugh , and never _approve_ or _condemn_ but in _leading - strings_ ) , he may possibly pass in a crowd of gentleman . but poor , poor ! what _can_ I say for ? I have a time in view , when my papers may fall under the inspection of a dear gentleman , to whom , next to , I be accountable for all my action and correspondences ; so I will either write a account of the matter , and seal it up separately , for , or , at a fit opportunity , break it to he , and let he know ( under secrecy , if he will promise it ) the step I take in it ; lest something arise hereafter , when I can not answer for myself , to render any thing dark or questionable in it . a method , I believe , very proper to be take by every marry lady ; and I presume the rather to say so , have have a good example for it : for I have often think of a little seal up parcel of papers , my lady make I burn in she presence , about a month before she die . " they be , , " say she , " such as would not concern I , let who will see they , could they
they know the spring and cause of they ; but , for want of a clue , my son might be at a loss what to think of several of those letter be he to find they , in look over my other papers , when I be no more . " let I add , that nothing could be more endearing than we parting with we noble guest . my lady repeat she command for what she often engage I to promise , that be to say , to renew the correspondence begin between we , so much ( as she be pleased to say ) to she satisfaction . I could not help shew she ladyship , who be always enquir after my writing employment , most of what pass between you and I : she admire you much , and wish . have more wit , that be she word : she should in that case , she say , be very glad to set on foot a treaty between you and he . but that , I fancy , can never be tolerable to you ; and I only mention it _en passant_.-- there be a french woman for you ! the countess be full of she kind wish for my happiness ; and my tell I , that if I could give she timely notice , she would be present on a _certain_ occasion . but , my dear , what could I say ?-- I know nothing of the matter !-- only , I be a sad coward , and have a thousand anxiety which I can not mention to any body . but , if I have such in the honourable estate of matrimony , what must those poor soul have , who be seduce , and have all manner of reason to apprehend , that the crime shall be follow by a punishment so _natural to it ? a punishment _in kind , as I may say ; which if it only end in forfeiture of life , follow the forfeiture of fame , must be think merciful and happy beyond expectation : for how shall they lay claim to the hope give to person in they circumstance that _they shall be save in child - bear , since the condition be , if they _continue _in faith and charity , and _with_ . now , my honoured mother , and my dear since I be upon this affecting subject , do not this text seem to give a comfortable hope to a good woman , who shall thus die , of be happy in the divine mercy ? for the , in the context , say , that _he suffer not a woman to teach , nor usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence _. -- and what be the reason he give ? why , a reason that be a natural consequence of the curse on the first disobedience , that she shall be in subjection to she husband . " for , " say he , " be not _deceive ; but the woman , be deceive , be in the transgression ._ " as much as to say -- have it not be for the woman , have keep he integrity , and therefore she punishment shall be , as it be say , " _I will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception : in sorrow shall thou bring forth child -- and thy husband shall rule over thee . " but nevertheless , if thou shal not survive the sharpness of thy sorrow , thy death shall be deem to be such a alleviation of thy part of the entailed transgression , that thou shalt _be save , if thou hast continue in faith and charity , and with . this , my honoured parent , and my dear friend , be _my_ paraphrase ; and I reap no small comfort from it , when I meditate upon it . but I shall make you as serious as myself ; and , my dear friend , perhaps , frighten you from enter into a state , in which we poor sex suffer so much , from the bridal morning , let it rise as gaily as it will upon a thoughtful mind , to that affect circumstance , ( throughout its whole progression ) , for which nothing but a tender , a generous , and a worthy husband can make they any part of amend . but a word or two more , as to the parting with we honoured company . I be a little indispose , and they all would excuse I , against my will , from attend they in the coach some mile , which they dear brother do . both lady most tenderly salute I , twice or thrice a - piece , fold they kind arm about I , and wish my safety and health , and charge I to _think_ little , and _hope_ much ; for they see I thoughtful at time , though I endeavoure to hide it from they . my say , with a goodness of temper that be peculiar to he , " my dearest sister ,-- may preserve you , and multiply you comforts ! I shall pray for you more than ever I do for myself , though I have so much more need of it :--i _must leave you -- but I leave one whom I love and honour next to , and ever shall . " look consciously silly . " I can say nothing , Madam , but " ( salut I ) " that I shall never forget you goodness to I . " I have before , in 's parlour , take leave of and , my lady ' woman : they each steal a hand of mine , and kiss it ,
, begge pardon for the freedom . but I answer , take each by she hand , and kiss she , " I shall always think of you with pleasure , my good friend ; for you have encourage I constantly by you presence in my private duty ; and may bless you , and the worthy family you so laudably serve , as well for you sake , as they own ! " they turn away with tear ; and would have say something to I , but could not .-- only both take by the hand , " happy ! " say they , almost in a breath . " and happy I too , " repeat I , " in my , and in such kind well - wisher as and . wear this , ;-- wear this , , for my sake : " and to each I give a ring , with a crystal and brilliant set about it , which . have buy a week before for this purpose : he have a great opinion of both the good folk , and often praise they prudence , and quiet and respectful behaviour to every body , so different from the impertinence ( that be he word ) of most lady ' woman who be favourite . say , " I have enjoy many happy hour in you conversation , and : I shall miss you very much . " " I must endeaavor , " say I , take she hand , " to make it up to you , my good friend , as well as I can . and of late we have not have so many opportunity together as I should have wish , have I not be so agreeably engage as you know . so we must each try to comfort the other , when we have lose , I such noble , and you such worthy companion . " 's honest heart , before touch by the parting , shew itself at she eye . " wonder not , " say I , to the two gentlewoman , wip with my handkerchief she venerable cheek , " that I always thus endeavou to dry up all my good 's tear ; " and then I kiss she , think of you , my dear mother ; and I be force to withdraw a little abruptly , lest I should be too much move myself ; for have we departing company enquire into the occasion , they would perhaps have think it derogatory ( though I should not ) to my present station , and too much retrospect to my former . I could not , in conversation between . and myself , when I be gratefully expatiat upon the amiable character of we noble guest , and of they behaviour and kindness to I , help observe , that I have little expect , from some hints which formerly dropt from , to find my good so polite and so sensible a man . " he be a very good - natured man , " reply . " I believe I might once or twice drop some disrespectful word of he . but it be the effect of passion at the time , and with a view to two or three point of he conduct in public life ; for which i take the liberty to find fault with he , and receive very unsatisfactory excuse . one of these , I remember , be in a conference between a committee of each house of parliament , in which he behave in a way I could not wish from a man so nearly ally to I by marriage ; for all he could talk of , be the dignity of they house , when the reason of the thing be strong with the other ; and it fall to my lot to answer what he say ; which I do with some asperity ; and this occasion a coolness between we for some time . " but no man make a better figure in private life than Davers ; especially now that my sister 's good sense have get the better of she passion , and she can behave with tolerable decency towards he . for once , , it be not so : the violence of she spirit make he appear in a light too little advantageous either to he quality or merit . but now he improve upon I every time I see he . " you know not , my dear , what a disgrace a haughty and passionate woman bring upon she husband , and upon herself too , in the eyes of she own sex , as well as ours . Nay , even those lady , who would be as glad of dominion as she , if they might be permit to exercise it , despise other who do , and the man _most_ who suffer it . " and let I tell you , " say the dear man , with a air that shew he be satisfied with he own conduct in this particular , " that you can not imagine how much a woman owe to she husband , as well with regard to _her own _peace of mind , as to _both they reputation ( however it may go against the grain with she sometimes ) , if he be a man who have discretion to keep she encroaching passion under a genteel and reasonable control ! " how do you like this doctrine , ? -- I will warrant , you believe , that I could do no less than drop . one of my best curtg sy , in acknowledgment of my obligation to he , for so considerately preserve to I _my peace of mind , and _my reputation , as well as t_his own , in
in this case . but after all , when one duly weigh the matter , what he say may be right in the main ; for I have not be able to contradict he , partial as I be to my sex , when he have point out to I instance in the behaviour of certain lady , who , like child , the more they have be humoure , the more humoursome they have grow ; which must have occasion as great uneasiness to themselves , as to they husband . will you excuse I , my dear ? this be between ourselves ; for I do not own so much to . for one should not give up one 's sex , you know , if one can help it : for the man will be as apt to impose , as the woman to encroach , I doubt . well , but here , my honest parent , and my dear , at last , I end my journal - wise letter , as I may call they ; we noble guest be go , and we time and employment roll on in much the same manner , as in past day , of which I have give a account . I be , _my dearest father and mother , and best belov , you dutiful and affectionate_ P.B. MY , I hear that be in no good state of health . I be very sorry for it . I pray for she life , that she may be a credit ( if it please ) to the penitence she have so lately assume . do , my dear _good_ , vouchsafe to the poor soul the honour of a visit : she may be low - spirit .-- she may be too much sunk with the recollection of past thing . , with that sweetness which be so natural to , she droop heart ; and let she know , that I have a true concern for she , and give it she in charge to take care of herself , and spare nothing that will administer either to she health or peace of mind . you will pardon I that I put you upon a office so unsuitable from a lady in you station , to a person in hers ; but not to you piety and charity , where a duty so eminent as that of visit the sick , and cheer the doubting mind , be in the question . I know you condescension will give she great comfort ; and if she should be hasten to she account , what a pleasure will it give such a lady as you , to have illuminate a benighted mind , when it be totter on the verge of death ! I know she will want no spiritual help from good ; but then the kind notice of so generally esteem a young lady , will raise she more than can be imagine : for there be a tenderness , a sympathy , in the good person of we sex to one another , that ( while the best of the other seem but to act as in office , say those thing , which , though edify and convince , one be not certain proceed not rather from the fortitude of they minds , than the tenderness of they nature ) mingles with one be very spirit , thin the animal mass , and run through one 's heart in the same lify current ( I can not clothe my thought suitably to express what I would ) , give assurance , as well as pleasure , in the most arduous case , and brighten we misty prospects , till we see the of rise on the hill of comfort , and dispell the heavy fog of doubt and diffidence . this it be make I wish and long as I do , for the company of my dear . of when shall I see you ? when shall I ?-- to speak to my present case , it be _all I long for ; and , pardon my freedom of expression , as well as thought , when I let you know in this instance , how _early I experience the _ardent longing of one in the way I be in . but I ought not to set my heart upon any thing not in my own power , and which may be subject to accident , and the control of other . but let whatever intervention happen , so I have you _will to come , I must be rejoice in you kind intention , although you _power_ should not prove answerable . but I will say no more , than that I be , my honoure father and mother , you ever dutiful daughter ; and , my dear , _you affectionate and obliged_ P.B. from to MY . , we be greatly oblige to you for every particular article in you entertaining journal , which you have bring , sooner than we wish , to a conclusion . we can not express how much we admire you for you judicious charity , so easy to be practise , yet so uncommon in the manner , and for you inimitable conduct in the affair of you frail Polly and the silly . you account of the visit of the four rake ; of you parting with you noble guest ; .' letter ( a original indeed ! ) have all greatly entertaine we , as you prerogative hint have amuse we : but we defer we opinion of those hints , till we have the case more fully explain . but , my dear friend , be you not in danger of fall into a too thoughtful and gloomy way ? by the latter part of you last letter , we be
be afraid you be ; and my mamma , and , and , enjoin I to write , to caution you on that head . but there be the less need of it , because you prudence will always suggest to you reason , as it do in that very letter , that must out - balance you fear . Think_ little , and _hope_ much , be a good lesson in you case , and to a lady of you temper ; and I hope Lady Davers will not in vain have give you that caution . after all , I dare say you thoughtfulness be but symptomatical , and will go off in proper time . but to wave this : let I ask you , be . conduct to you as _respectful_ , I do not mean fond , when you be alone together , as in company ?-- forgive I -- but you have hint two or three time , in you letter , that he always be most complaisant to you in company ; and you observe , that _wisely do he act in this , as he thereby do credit with every body to he own choice . I make no doubt , that the many charme scene which you genius and fine behaviour furnish out to he , must , as often as they happen , inspire he with joy , and even rapture : and must make he love you more for you mind than for you person :-- but these rapturous scene last very little longer than the present moment . what I want to know is , whether in the _steadier_ part of life , when you be both nearer the level of we common folk , he give up any thing of he own will in compliment to yours ? whether he act the part of a respectful , polite gentleman , in he behaviour to you ; and break not into you retirement , in the dress , and with the brutal roughness of a fox - hunter ?-- make no difference , perhaps , between the field or he stud ( I will not say kennel ) and you chamber or closet ?-- policy , for he own credit - sake , as I mention , account to I well , for he complaisance to you in public . but he regular and uniform behaviour to you , in you retirement , when the conversation between you turn upon usual and common subject , and you have not oblige he to rise to admiration of you , by such scene as those of you two parson , , and the like : be what would satisfy my curiosity , if you please to give I a instance or two of it . now , my dearest , if you can give I a case , partly or nearly thus circumstance , you will highly oblige I : first , where he have borne with any infirmity of you own ; and I know of none where you can give he such a opportunity , except you get into a vapourish habit , by give way to a temper too thoughtful and apprehensive : next , that , in complaisance to _your_ will , he recede from he _own_ in any one instance : next , whether he break not into you retirement unceremoniously , and without apology or concern , as I hint above . you know , my dear , all I mean , by what I have say . ; and if you have any pretty conversation in memory , by the recital of which , this my bold curiosity may be answer , pray oblige I with it ; and we shall be able to judge by it , not only of the in - bear generosity which all that know . have be willing to attribute to he , but of the likelihood of the continuance of both you felicity , upon term suitable to the character of a fine lady and fine gentleman : and , of consequence , worthy of the imitation of the most delicate of we own sex . you oblige _longing , my beloved dear lady , for my company , I hope , will very soon be answer . my papa be so pleased with you sweet earnestness on this occasion , that he join with my mamma ; and both , with equal cheerfulness , say , you should not be many day in before I . and he mistress go on swimmingly , and have not yet have one quarrel . the only person , he , of either sex , that ever know so intimately , and so long , without one ! this be all I have to say , at present , when I have assure you , my dear , how much I be _you oblige , and affectionate_ POLLy Darnford . my dearest , I be afraid I end my last letter in a gloomy way ; and I be oblige to you for the kind and friendly notice you take of it . it be owe to a train of think which sometimes I get into , of late ; I hope only symptomatically , as you say , and that the cause and effect will soon vanish together . but what a task , my dear friend , I will warrant , you think you have set I ! I think , in the progress of my journal , and in my letter , I have give so many instance of . polite tenderness to I , that no new one would be require at my hand ; and when I say he be always _most_ complaisant before company , I little expect , that such a inference would be draw from my word , as would tend to
to question the uniformity of he behaviour to I , when there be no witness to it . but I be glad of a opportunity to clear up all you doubt on this subject . to begin then : you first desire a instance , where . have borne with some infirmity of mine : next , that in complaisance to my will , he have reced from he own : and lastly , whether he break not into my retirement unceremoniously ; and without apology or concern , make no difference between the field or the stud , and my chamber or closet ? as to the first , he bear with my infirmity ; he be daily give instance of he goodness to I on this head ; and I be asham to say , that of late I give he so much occasion for they as I do ; but he see my apprehensiveness , at time , though I endeaavor to conceal it ; and no husband be ever so soothing and so indulgent as . he give I the best advice , as to my malady , if I may call it one : treat I with redouble tenderness : talk to I upon the subject I most delight to dwell upon : as of my worthy parent ; what they be do at this time , and at that ; of we intend journey to ; of the diversion of the town ; of 's company ; and when he go abroad , send up my good to I , because I should not be alone : at other time , take I abroad with he , bring this neighbour and that neighbou to visit ; and carry I to visit they ; talk of we journey to , and into , and to my 's , to , to Tunbridge , and I can not tell whither , when the apprehended time shall be over .-- in fine , my dear , you can not imagine one half of he tender goodness and politeness to I !-- then he hardly ever go to any distance , but bring some pretty present he think will be grateful to I . when at home , he be seldom out of my company ; delights to teach I French and italian , and read I piece of manuscript poetry , in several of the modern tongue ( for he speak they all ) ; explain to I every thing I understand not ; delights to answer all my question , and to encourage my inquisitiveness and curiosity , try to give I a notion of picture and medal , and read I lecture upon they , for he have a fine collection of both ; and every now and then will have it , that he have be improve by my question and observation . what say you to these thing , my dear ? do they come up to you first question ? or do they not ? or be not what I have say , a full answer , be I to say no more , to _all_ you enquiry ? of my dear , I be thoroughly convince , that half the misunderstanding , among married people , be owe to trifle , to petty distinction , to mere word , and little captious folly , to over-weening , or unguarded petulance : and who would forego the solid satisfaction of life , for the sake of triumphing in such poor contention , if one could triumph ? but you next require of I a instance , where , in complaisance to _my_ will , he have reced from _he own ?_ I do not know what to say to this . when be all tenderness and indulgence , and require of I nothing , that I can have a material objection to , ought I _not to oblige he ? can I have a will that be not he ? or would it be excusable if I _have ?_ all little matter I cheerfully give up : great one have not yet occur between we , and I hope never will . one point , indeed , I have some apprehension _may_ happen ; and that , to be plain with you , be , we have have a debate or two on the subject ( which I maintain ) of a mother 's duty to nurse she own child ; and I be sorry to say it , he seem more determined than I wish he be , against it . I hope it will not proceed so far as to awake the sleeping dragon I mention . _Prerogative by name ; but I doubt I can not give up this point very contentedly . but as to lesser point , have I be a duchess bear , I think I would not have conteste they with my husband . I could give you many respectful instance too , of he receding , when he have desire to see what I have be write , and I have tell he to whom , and beg to be excuse . one such instance I can give since I begin this letter . this be it : I put it in my bosom , when he come up : he see I do so : " be you write , my dear , what I must not see ? " " I be write to , : and she beg you might not at present . " " this augment my curiosity , . what can two such lady write , that I may not see ? " " if you will not be displease , , I have rather you would not , because she desire you may not see she letter , nor this my answer , till the letter be in
in she hand . " " then I will not , " return . will this instance , my dear , come up to you demand for one , where he recede from he own will , in complaisance to mine ? but now , as to what both we notions and we practice be on the article of my retirement , and whether he break in upon they unceremoniously , and without apology , let the conversation I promise inform you , which begin on the follow occasion . ride out early one morning , within a few day past , and do not return till the afternoon ; a absence I have not be use to of late ; and breakfast and dine without he be also a new thing with I , I have such a impatience to see he , have expect he at dinner , that I be force to retire to my closet , to try to divert it , by writing ; and the gloomy conclusion of my last be then the subject . he return about four o'clock , and indeed do _not tarry to change he riding - dress , as you politeness , my dear friend , would perhaps have expect ; but come directly up to I , with a impatience to see I , equal to my own , when he be tell , upon enquiry , that I be in my closet . I hear he welcome step , as he come up stair ; which generally , after a longer absence than I expect , have such a effect upon my fond heart , that it give a responsive throb for every step he take towards I , and beat quicker and faster , as he come nearer . I meet he at my closet door . " so , my dear love , " say he , " how do you ? " fold he kind arm about I , and salut I with ardour . " whenever I have be but a few hour from you , my impatience to see my beloved , will not permit I to stand upon the formality of a message to know how you be engage ; but I break in upon you , even in my riding - dress , as you see . " " dear sir , you be very obliging . but I have no notion of _mere_ formality of this kind " --( how unpolite this , my dear , in you friend ? ) --" in a married state , since ' tis impossible a virtuous wife can be employ about any thing that she husband may not know , and so need not fear surprise . " " I be glad to hear you say this , my ; for I have always think the extraordinary civility and distance of this kind which I have observe among several persons of rank , altogether unaccountable . for if they be exact by the lady , I should suspect she have reserve , which she herself believe I could not approve . if not exacte , but practise of choice by the gentleman , it carry with it , in my opinion , a false air of politeness , little less than affrontive to the lady , and dishonourable to himself ; for do it not look as if he suppose , and allow , that she might be so employ that it be necessary to apprise she of he visit , lest he should make discoveries not to she credit or he own ? " " one would not , " ( for I think he conclusion too severe ) , " make such a harsh supposition as this neither : for there be little delicacy and moment of retirement , no doubt , in which a modest lady would wish to be indulge by the tenderest husband . " " it may be so in a _early matrimony , before the lady 's confidence in the honour and discretion of the man she have choose have disengage she from she bridal reserve . " " bridal reserf , dear Sy ! permit I to give it as my humble opinion , that a wife 's behaviour ought to be as pure and circumspect , in degree , as that of a bride , or even of a maiden lady , be she confidence in she husband 's honour and discretion ever so great . for , indeed , I think a gross or a careless demeanour little become that modesty which be the peculiar excellency and distinction of we sex . " " you account very well , my dear , by what you now say for you own over -nice behaviour , as I have sometimes think it . but be we not all apt to argue for a practice we make we own , because we _do_ make it we own , rather than from the reason of the thing ? " " I hope , , that be not the present case with I ; for , permit I to say , that a over -free or negligent behaviour of a lady in the married state , must be a mark of disrespect to she consort , and would show as if she be very little solicitous about what appearance she make in he eye . and must not this beget in he a slight opinion of she sex too , as if , suppose the gentleman have be a free liver , she would convince he there be no other difference in the sex , but as they be within or without the pale , license by the law , or act in defiance of it ? " " I understand the force of you argument , . but you be go to say something more . "
" " only , , permit I to add , that when , in my particular case , you enjoin I to appear before you always dress , even in the early part of the day , it would be wrong , if I be less regardful of my behaviour and action , than of my appearance . " " I believe you be right , my dear , if a precise or unnecessary scrupulousness be avoid , and where all be unaffected , easy , and natural , as in my . for I have see marry lady , both in and , who have keep a husband at a greater distance than they have exact from some of he sex , who have be more entitled to he resentment , than to he wife 's intimacy . " but to wave a subject , in which , as I can with pleasure say , neither of we have much concern , tell I , my dearest , how you be employ before I come up ? here be pen and ink : here , too , be paper , but it be as spotless as you mind . to whom be you direct you favour now ? may I not know you subject ? " .' letter be a part of it ; and so I have put it by , at he approach , and not choose he should see that -- " I be write , " reply I , " to : but I think you must not ask I to see what I have write _this_ time . I put it aside that you should not , when I hear you welcome step . the subject be we parting with we noble guest ; and a little of my apprehensiveness , on a occasion upon which we sex may write to one another ; but , for some of the reason we have be mention , gentlemen should not desire to see . " " then I will not , my dearest love . " ( so here , my dear , be another instance -- I could give you a hundr such -- of he receding from he own will , in complaisance to mine . ) " only , " continue he , " let I warn you against too much apprehensiveness , for you own sake , as well as mine ; for such a mind as my 's I can not permit to be habitually over-clouded . and yet there now hang upon you brow a over-thoughtfulness , which you must not indulge . " " indeed , , I be a little too thoughtful , from my subject , before you come ; but you presence , like the sun , have dissipate the mist that hang upon my mind . see you not , " and I press he hand with my lip , " they be all go already ? " smile upon he with a delight unfeigned . " not quite , my dearest ; and therefore , if you have no objection , I will change my dress , and attend you in the chariot for a hour or two , whither you please , that not one shadow may remain visible in this dear face ; " tenderly salut I . " Whithersoever you please , . a little airing with you will be highly agreeable to I . " the dear obliger go and change he dress in a instant ; and he lead I to the chariot , with he usual tender politeness , and we have a charming airing of several mile ; return quite happy , cheerful , and delighte with each other 's conversation , without call in upon any of we good neighbour : for what need of that , my dear , when we could be the best company in the world to each other ? do these instance come up to you question , my dear ? or , do they not ?-- if you think not , I could give you we conversation in the chariot : for I write it down at my first leisure , so highly be I deligh with it ; for the subject be my dearest parent ; a subject start by himself , because he know it would oblige I . but be tired with writing , I may reserve it , till I have the pleasure of see you , if you think it worth ask for . and so I will hasten to a conclusion of this long letter . I have only farther to add , for my comfort , that next se'n - night , if nothing hinder , we be to set out for . and why do you think I say _for my comfort ?_ only that I shall then soon have the opportunity , to assure you personally , as you give I hope , how much I be , my dear , _you truly affectionate . P.B. my dear , one more letter , and I have do for a great while , because I hope you presence will put a end to the occasion . I shall now tell you of my second visit to the dairy - house , where we go to breakfast , in the chariot and four , because of the distance , which be ten pretty long mile . I transcribe for you , from letter write formerly to my dear parent , a account of my former dairy - house visit , and what the people were , and whom I see there ; and although I besotch you to keep that affair to yourself , as too much affect the reputation of my to be know any farther , and even to destroy that account , when you have peruse it ; yet ,
, I make no doubt , you remember the story , and so I need not repeat any part of it . when we arrive there , we find at the door , expect we ( for they hear the chariot - wheel at a distance ) , my pretty , and two other , who have earn they ride , attend by the governess 's daughter , a discreet young gentlewoman . as soon as I step out , the child run into my arm with great eagerness , and I as tenderly embrace she , and lead she into the parlour , ask she abundance of question about she work , and she lesson ; and among the rest if she have merit this distinction of the chaise and dairy - house breakfast , or if it be owe to she uncle 's favour , and to that of she governess ? the young gentlewoman assure I it be to both , and shew I she needlework , and penmanship ; and the child be highly pleased with my commendation . I take a good deal of notice of the other two Misse , for they school - fellow 's sake , and make each of they a present of some little toy ; and my , of a number of pretty trinket , with which she be highly delighted ; and I tell she , that I would wait upon she governess , when I come from into the country again , and see in what order she keep she little matters ; for , above all thing , I love pretty house - wifely Misse ; and then , I would bring she more . observ , with no small satisfaction , the child 's behaviour , which be very pretty ; and appear as fond of she , as if he have be _more_ than she _uncle , and yet see under some restraint , lest it should be take , that he _be more . such power have secret guilt , poor gentleman ! to lessen and restrain a pleasure , that would , in a happier light , have be so laudable to have manifested ! I be go to let you into a charme scene , result from this perplexity of the dear gentleman . a scene that have afford I high delight ever since ; and always will , when I think of it . the child be very fond of she uncle , and tell he she love he dearly , and always would love and honour he , for give she such a good aunt . " you talk , , " say she , " when I see you before , that I should come and live with you -- will you let I , Madam ? indeed I will be very good , and do every thing you bid I , and mind my book , and my needle ; indeed I will . " " ask you uncle , my dear , " say I ; " I should like you pretty company of all thing . " she go to and say , " shall I , , go and live with my aunt ?-- pray let I , when you come from again . " " you have a very good governess , child , " say he ; " and she can not part with you . " " yes , but she can . ; she have a great many Misse , and can spare I well enough ; and if you please to let I ride in you coach sometimes , I can go and visit my governess , and beg a holiday for the , now - and - then , when I be almost a woman , and then all the Misse will love I . " " do not the love you now , ? " say he . " yes , they love I well enough , for matter of that ; but they will love I better , when I can beg they a holiday . do , dear , let I go home to my new aunt , next time you come into the country . " I be much pleased with the dear child 's earnestness ; and permit she to have she full argument with she beloved uncle ; but be much move , and he himself be under some concern , when she say , " but you should , in pity , let I live with you , , for I have no papa , nor mamma neither : they be so far off !-- but I will love you both as if you be my own papa and mamma ; so , dear now , my good uncle , promise the poor girl that have never a papa nor mamma ! " I withdraw to the door : " it will rain , I believe , " say I , and look up . and , indeed , I have almost a shower in my eye : and have I keep my place , could not have refrain shew how much I be affect . , as I say , be a little move ; but for fear the young gentlewoman should take notice of it --" how ! my dear , " say he , " no papa and mamma ! -- do they not send you a pretty black boy to wait upon you , a while ago ? have you forget that ? " -- " that be true , " reply she : " but what be a black boy to live with my new aunt ?-- that be better a great deal than a black boy ! " " well , you aunt and I will consider of it , when we come from . be
be a good girl , meantime , and do as you governess would have you , and then you do not know what we may do for you . " " well then , , " say she to she young governess , " let I be set two tasnks instead of one , and I will learn all I can to deserve to go to my aunt . " in this manner the little prattler diverte herself . and as we return from they , the scene I hint at , open as follow : be pleased to say , " what a poor figure do the proudest man make , my dear , under the sense of a concealed guilt , in company of the innocent who know it , and even of those who do not ! -- since the casual expression of a baby shall overwhelm he with shame , and make he unable to look up without confusion . I blush for myself , " continue he , " to see how you be affect for I , and yet withdraw , to avoid reproach I so much as with a look . surely , , I must then make a most contemptible appearance in you eye ! do you not disdain I at that moment ? " " ! how can you speak such a word ? a word I can not repeat after you ! for at that very time , I beheld you with the more reverence , for see you noble heart touch with a sense of you error ; and it be such a earnest to I of the happiest change I could ever wish for , and in so young a gentleman , that it be one half joy for that , and the other half concern at the little charmer 's accidental plea , to she best and nearest friend , for come home to she new aunt , that affect I so sensibly as you see . " " you must not talk to I of the child 's come home , after this visit , ; for how , at this rate , shall I stand the reproach of my own mind , when I see the little prater every day before I , and think of what she poor mamma have suffer on my account ! ' tTis enough , that in _you_, my dear , I have a hourly reproach before I , for my attempt on you virtue ; and I have nothing to boast of , but that I give way to the triumph of you innocence : and what then be my boast ? " " what be you boast , dearest ? you have everything to boast , that be worthy of be boast of . " you be the best of husband , the best of landlord , the best of master , the best of friend ; and , with all these excellency , and a mind , as I hope , continually improve , and more and more affect with the sense of it be past mistake , will you ask , dear , what be you boast ? " of my dearest , dear , " and then I press he hand with my lip , " whatever you be to yourself , when you give way to reflection so hopeful , you be the glory and the boast of you grateful Pamela ! and permit I to add , " tear stand in my eye , and hold he hand between mine , " that I never beheld you in my life , in a more amiable light , than when I see that noble consciousness which you speak of , manifest itself in you eye , and you countenance -- of ! this be a sight of joy , of true joy ! to one who love you for you dear soul 's sake , as well as for that of you person ; and who look forward to a companionship with you beyond the term of this transitory life . " put my arm round he arm , as I sit , my fearful eye watch he , " I fear . , I have be too serious ! I have , perhaps , break one of you injunction ! have cast a gloominess over you mind ! and if I have , dear Sir , forgive I ! " he clasp he arm around I : " o my belov , " say he ; " thou dear confirmer of all my better purpose ! how shall I acknowledge you inexpressible goodness to I ? I see every day more and more , my dear love , what confidence I may repose in you generosity and discretion ! you want no forgiveness ; and my silence be owe to much better motive than to those you be apprehensive of . " he see my grateful transport , and kindly say , " not , my belov , for word to express sentiment which you eye and you countenance much more significantly express than any word _can_ do . every day produce new instance of you affectionate concern for my _future_ as well as _present_ happiness : and I will endeaavor to confirm to you all the hope which the present occasion have give you of I , and which I see by these transporting effect be so desirable to you . " the chariot bring we home sooner than I wish , and hand I into the parlour . " here , , " say he , meet she in the passage , " receive you angelic lady . I must take a little tour without you , ; for I have have too much of you dear company , and must leave you , to descmend again into myself ; for you
you have raise I to such a height , that it be with pain I look down from it . " he kiss my hand , and go into he chariot again ; for it be but half a hour after twelve ; and say he would be back by two at dinner . he leave wonder at he word , and at the solemn air with which he utter they . but when I tell that good friend the occasion , I have a new joy in the pleasure and gratulation of the dear good woman , on what have pass . my next letter will be from , and to you , my honoured parent ; for to you , my dear , I shall not write again , expect to see you soon . but I must now write seldomer , because I be to renew my correspondence with ; with whom I can not be so free , as I have be with ; and so I doubt , my dear father and mother , you can not have the particular of that correspondence ; for I shall never find time to transcribe . but every opportunity that offer , you may assure yourselves , shall be laid hold of by you ever- dutiful daughter . and now , my dear , as I inscribe this letter to you , let I conclude it , with the assurance , that I be , and ever will be _your most affectionate friend and servant , my and , I know you will be pleased to hear that we arrive safely in town last night . we find a stately , well - furnish , and convenient house ; and I have my closet , or library , and my withdrawing room , all in complete order , which . give I possession of in the most obliging manner . I be in a new world , as I may say , and see such vast pile of building , and such a concourse of people , and hear such a rattling of coach in the day , that I hardly know what to make of it , as yet . then the nightly watch , go they hourly round , disturb I . but I shall soon be use to that , and sleep the sounder , perhaps , for the security it assure to we . be impatient to show I what be curiious in and about this vast city , and to hear , as he be pleased to say , my observation upon what I shall see . he have carry I through several of the fine street this day in he chariot ; but , at present , I have to confuse a notion of thing , to give any account of they : nor shall I trouble you with description of that kind ; for you be within a day 's journey of , I hope for the pleasure of see you oftener than I could expect before ; and shall therefore leave these matters to you own observation , and what you will hear from other . I be impatient for the arrival of my dear , whose company and conversation will reconcile I , in a great measure , to this new world . we family at present be , , and six man servant , include the coachman . the four maid be also with we . but my good be indispose ; so come not up with we ; but we expect she and in a day or two : for . have give she to my wish ; and as 's business will require he to be up and down frequently , 's care will be the better dispense with . I long to see the dear good woman , and shall be more in my element when I do . then I have , besides , my penitent , who have never hold up she head since that deplorable instance of she weakness , which I mention to you and to , yet be I as kind to she as if nothing bad happen . I wish , however , some good husband would offer for she . , we worthy chaplain , be now with . he purpose to give we he company here till , when probably matter will be adjust for he to take possession of he living . meantime , not to let fall a good custom , when perhaps we have most occasion for it , I make , who be reverend by he year and silver hair , supply he place , appoint he the prayer he be to read . preserve you both in health , and continue to I , I beseech you , you prayer and blessing , conclude _your ever dutiful daughter , . . from to ._ my , I must beg pardon , for have be in this great town more than a week , and not have find a opportunity to tender my devoir to you ladyship . you know , dear Madam , what hurries and fatigue must attend such a journey , to one in my way , and to a entire new settlement in which a hundred thing must be do , and attend to , with a preference to other occasion , however delightful . yet , I must own , we find a stately , well - order , and convenient house : but , although it be not far from the field , and have a airy opening to its back part , and it be front to a square , as it be call , yet I be not reconcile to it , so entirely as to the beloved mansion we leave . my dear . have be , and be , busily employ in order some
some few alteration , to make thing still more commodious . he have furnish I out a pretty library ; and have allot I very convenient apartment besides : the furniture of every place be rich , as befit the mind and fortune of the generous owner . but I shall not offer at particular , as we hope to have the honour of a visit from my good lord , and you ladyship , before the winter weather set in , to make the roads too dirty and deep : but it be proper to mention , that the house be so large , that we can make a great number of bed , the more conveniently to receive the honour of you ladyship , and my lord , and . 's other friend will do we . I have not yet be at any of the public diversion . . have carry I , by gentle turn , out of he workman 's way , ten mile round this overgrown capital , and through the principal of its numerous street . the village that lie spangle about this vast circumference , as well on the other side the noble Thames ( which I have before a notion of , from 's celebrate 's ) , as on the side , be beautiful , both by building and situation , beyond what I have imagine , and several of they seem larger than many of we country town of note . but it would be impertinent to trouble you ladyship with these matters , who be no stranger to what be worthy of notice in . but I be surprise , when observ to I , that this whole county , and the two city of and , be represent in parliament by no more than eight member , when so many borough town in be inferior to the meanest villag about . I be in daily expectation of the arrival of , and then I shall wish ( accompany by a young lady of so polite a taste ) to see a good play . . have already shew I the opera - house , and the play - house , though silent , as I may say ; that , as he be pleased to observe , they should not be new to I , and that the sight might not take off my attention from the performance , when I go to the play ; so that I can conceive a tolerable notion of every thing , from the disposition of the seat , the box , galleries , pit , the music , scene , and the stage ; and so shall have no occasion to gaze about I , like a country novice , whereby I might attract a notice that I would not wish , either for my own credit , or you dear brother 's honour . I have have a pleasure which I have not in ; and that be , that on I be at church , without gap crowd to attend we , and blessing too loud for my wish . yet I be more gazed at ( and so be ) than I expect , consider there be so many well - dress gentry , and some nobility there , and _they stare as much as any body , but will not , I hope , when we cease to be a novelty . we have already have several visitor to welcome to town , and to congratulate he on he marriage ; but some , no doubt , to see , and to find fault with he rustic ; for it be impossible , you know , Madam , that a gentleman so distinguished by he merit and fortune should have take a step of such consequence to himself and family , and not to have be know by every body so to have do . Atkyns be in town , and have take apartment in ; and he bring with he a younger brother of 's , who , it seem , be a merchant . have also be to pay he respects to . whose school fellow he be at , the little time be there . he lordship promise , that he lady shall make I a visit , and accompany I to the opera , as soon as we be fully settled . a gentleman of the , by name , and Fanshow of 's , both lawyer , and of .'s former acquaintance , very sprightly and modish gentleman , have also welcome we to town , and make abundance of gay compliment on my account to my face , all in the common frothy run . they may be polite gentleman , but I can not say I over-much like they . there be something so opiniate , so seemingly insensible of rebuke , either from _within_ or _without , and yet not promise to avoid deserve one occasionally , that I could as _lieve_ wish . and they would not renew they former acquaintance . I be very bold you ladyship will say -- but you command I to write freely : yet I would not be think to be uneasy , with regard to you dear brother 's moral , from these gentleman ; for , oh , Madam , I be a bless creature , and be hourly happier and happier in the confidence I have as to that particular : but I imagine they will force themselves upon he , more than he may wish , or would permit , be the acquaintance now to begin ; for they be not of he turn of mind , as it seem to I ; be , by a sentence or two that dropt from they , very free , and very frothy in they conversation ; and by they
they laugh at what they say themselves , take that for wit which will not stand the test , if I may be allow to say so . but they have hear , no doubt , what a person . goodness to I have lift into notice ; and they think themselves warrant to say any thing before he country girl . he be pleased to ask I , when they be go , how I like he two lawyer ? and say , they be person of family and fortune . " I be glad of it , , " say I ; " for they own sake . " " then you do not approve of they , ? " " they be _your_ friend , ; and I can not have any dislike to they . " " they say good thing _sometime , " return he . " I do not doubt it , ; but you say good thing _alway _. " " ' Tis happy for I , my dear , you think so . but tell I , what you think of th'ey ? " " I shall be better able , , to answer you question , if I see they a second time . " " but we form notion of person at first sight , sometimes , my dear ; and you be seldom mistaken in yours . " " I only think . , that they have neither of they any diffidence : but they profession , perhaps , may set they above that . " " they do not _practise , my dear ; they fortune enable they to live without it ; and they be too studious of they pleasure , to give themselves any trouble they be not oblige to take . " " they seem to I . , _qualify for practice : they would make great figure at the bar , I fancy . " " why so ? " " only , because they seem prepared to think _well_ of what they say _themselve ; and _lightly of what _other people say , or may think , _or they _. " " that , indeed , my dear , be the necessary qualification of a public speaker , be he lawyer , or what he will : the man who can not doubt _himself , and can think meanly of he _auditor , never fail to speak with _self -applause_ at least . " " but you will pardon I , good Sir , for speak my mind so freely , and so early of these _your friend _. " " I never , my love , ask you a question , I wish you not to answer ; and always expect you answer should be without reserve ; for many time I may ask you opinion , as a corrective or a confirmation of my own judgment . " how kind , how indulgent be this , my good lady ! but you know , how generously you dear brother treat I , on all occasion ; and this make I so bold as I often be . it may be necessary , my dear lady , to give you a account of we visitor , in order to make the future part of my write the more intelligible ; because what I have to write may turn sometimes upon the company we see : for which reason , I shall also just mention , a scottish gentleman , with whom become acquainted in he travels , who seem to be a polite ( and say , be a learned ) man , and a virtuoso : he , and a nephew of he , of the same name , a bashful gentleman , and who , for that reason , I imagine , have a merit that lie deeper than a first observation can reach , be just go from we , and be receive with so much civility by as entitle they to my respectful regard . thus , , do I run on , in a manner , without material ; and only to show you the pleasure I take in obey you . I hope my good enjoy he health , and continue I in he favour ; which I value extremely , as well as you ladyship 's . , I hope , likewise enjoy he health . but let I not forget my particular and thankful respects to the Countess , for she favour and goodness to I , which I shall ever place next , in my grateful esteem , to the honour I have receive from you ladyship , and which bind I to be , with the greatest respect , _you faithful and obliged servant , my and , I write to you both , at this time , for you advice in a particular dispute , which be the only one I have have , or I hope ever shall have , with my dear benefactor ; and as he be pleased to insist upon he way , and it be a point of conscience with I , I must resolve to be determine by you joint advice ; for , if my father and mother , and husband , be of one opinion , I must , I think , yield up my own . this be the subject :-- I think a mother ought , if she can , to be the nurse to she own child . say , he will not permit it . it be the first will not I have hear from he , or give occasion for : and I tell he , that it be a point of conscience with I , and I hope he will indulge I : but the dear gentleman have a odd way of arguing , that sometimes puzzle I
I . he pretend to answer I from Scripture ; but I have some doubt of _his_ exposition ; and he give I leave to write to you , though yet he will not promise to be determine by you opinion if they be not the same with he own ; and I say to he , " be this fair , my dearest b.? be it ? " he have get the dean 's opinion with he ; for we debate begin before we come to town : and then he would not let I state the case ; but do it himself ; and yet ' tis but a half opinion , as I may , neither . for it be , that if the husband be set upon it , it be a wife 's duty to obey . but I can not see how that be ; for if it be the _natural_ duty of a mother , it be a _divine_ duty ; and how can a husband have power to discharge a divine duty ? as great as a wife 's obligation be to obey she husband , which be , I own , one indispensable of the marriage contract , it ought not to interfere with what one take to be a superior duty ; and must not one be one 's own judge of action , by which we must stand or fall ? I will tell you my plea : I say , that where a mother be unhealthy ; subject to communicative distemper , as scrophulous or scorbutic , or consumptive disorder , which have infect the blood or lung ; or where they have not plenty of nourishment for the child , that in these case , a dispensation lie of course . but where there be good health , free spirit , and plentiful nourishment , I think it a indispensable duty . for this be the custom of old , of all the good wife we read of in . then the nourishment of the mother must be most natural to the child . these be my plea , among other : and this be he answer which he give to I in writing : " as to what you allege , my dear , of old custom ; time and fashions be much change . if you tell I of 's , or 's , or 's , or 's nurse they child , I can answer , that the one drew water at a well , for she father 's flock ; another knead cake , and bake they on the hearth ; another dress savoury meat for she husband ; and all of they perform the common office of the household : and when we modern lady shall follow such example in _every thing , they plea ought to be allow in this . " , my fondness for you personal graces , and the laudable , and , I will say , honest pleasure , I take in that easy , genteel form , which every body admire in you , at first sight , oblige I to declare , that I can by no means consent to sacrifice these to the carelessness into which I have see very nice lady sink , when they become nurse . moreover , my chief delight in you be for the beauty of you mind ; and unequall as they be , in my opinion , you have still a genius capable of great improvement ; and I sha not care , when I want to hear my read she French and latin lesson , which I take so much delight to teach she ( and to endeaavor to improve myself from she virtue and piety , at the same time ) , to seek my beloved in the nursery ; or to permit she to be engross by those baby office , which will better befit weaker mind . " no , my dear , you must allow I to look upon you as my scholar , in one sense ; as my companion in another ; and as my instructress , in a third . you know I be not govern by the worst motive : I be half overcome by you virtue : and you must take care , that you leave not you work half do . but I can not help look upon the nurse 's office , as a office beneath . let it have you inspection , you direction , and you sole attention , if you please , when I be abroad : but when I be at home , even a son and here , so jealous am I of you affections , shall not be my rival in they : nor will I have my rest break in upon , by you servants bring to you you dear little one , at time , perhaps , as unsuitable to my repose and you own , as to the child 's necessity . " the chief thing with you , my dear , be that you think it unnatural in a mother not to be a nurse to she own child , if she can ; and what be unnatural , you say , be sin . " some man may be fond of have they wife undertake this province , and good reason may be assign for such they fondness ; but it suit 's not I at all . and yet no man would be think to have a greater affection for child than myself , or be more desirous to do they justice ; for I think every one should look forward to posterity with a preference : but if my can be _better_ employ ; if the office can be equally well perform ; if you direction and superintendence will be sufficient ; and
and if I can not look upon you in that way with equal delight , as if it be otherwise ; I insist upon it , my , that you acquiesce with my _dispensation , and do not think to let I lose my beloved wife , and have a nurse put upon I instead of she . " as to that ( the nearest to I of all ) of danger to you constitution : there be as much reason to hope it may not be so , as to fear that it _may . for child sometimes bring health with they as well as infirmity ; and it be not a little likely , that the _nurse 's office may affect the health of one I hold most dear , who have no very robust constitution , and think it so much she duty to attend to it , that she will abridge herself of half the pleasure of life , and on that account confine herself within door , or , in the other case , must take with she she infant and she nursery - maid wherever she go ; and I shall either have very fine company ( shall I not ? ) or be obliged to deny myself yours . " then , as I propose to give you a smattering of the french and italian , I know not but I may take you on a little tour into and ; at least , to , , , , and the principal place of . Wherefore , as I love to look upon you as the companion of my pleasure , I advise you , my dearest love , not to weaken , or , to speak in a phrase proper to the present subject , _wean I from that love _to_ you , and admiration _of_ you , which hitherto have be rather increase than otherwise , as you merit , and regard for I have increase . " these , my dear parent , be charme allurement , almost irresistible temptation ! and what make I mistrust myself the more , and be the more diffident ; for we be but too apt to be persuade into any thing , when the motives be so tempting as the last . I take it for granted , that many wife will not choose to dispute this point so earnestly as I have do ; for we have have several little debate about it ; and it be the only point I have ever yet debat with he ; but one would not be altogether implicit neither . it be no compliment to he to be quite passive , and to have no will at all of one 's own : yet would I not dispute one point , but in supposition of a superior obligation : and this , he say , he can _dispense_ with . but alas ! my dear be never yet think so entirely fit to fill up the character of a casuistical divine , as that one may absolutely rely upon he decision in these serious point : and you know we must stand or fall by we own judgment . upon condition , therefore , that he require not to see this my letter , nor you answer to it , I write for you advice . but this I see plainly , that he will have he own way ; and if I can not get over my scruple , what shall I do ? for if I think it a _sin_ to submit to the dispensation he insist upon as in he power to grant , and to submit to it , what will become of my peace of mind ? for it be not in we power to believe as one will . as to the liberty he give I for a month , I should be loath to take it ; for one know not the inconvenience that may attend a change of nourishment ; or if I do , I should rather -- but I know not what I would say ; for I be but a young creature to be in this way , and so very unequal to it in every respect ! so I commit myself to 's direction , and you advice , as become _your ever dutiful daughter , my Dearest child , you mother and I have as well consider the case you put as we be able ; and we think you own reason very good ; and it be a thousand pity you honoure husband will not allow they , as you , my dear , make it such a point with you . very few lady would give they spouse , we believe , the trouble of this debate ; and few gentleman be so very nice as yours in this respect ; for I ( but what signify what such a mean soul as I think , compare to so learn and brave a gentleman ; yet I ) always think you dear mother , and she have be a pretty woman too , in she time , never look so lovely , as when I see she , like the pelican in the wilderness , feed she young one from she kind breast :-- and have I never so noble a estate , I should have have the same thought . but since the good ' squire can not take this pleasure ; since he so much value you person ; since he give you warn , that it may estrange he affections ; since he be impatient of denial , and think so highly of he prerogative ; since he may , if disoblige , resume some bad habit , and so you may have all you prayer and hope in he perfect reformation frustrated , and find you own
own power to do good more narrow : we think , besides the obedience you have vowe to he , and be the duty of every good wife , you ought to give up the point , and acquiesce ; for this seemeth to we to be the lesser evil : and , if it should be you duty , will not be less merciful than man ; who , as he honour say , by the law of the realm , excuse a wife , when she be faulty by the command of the husband ; and we hope , the fault he be pleased to make you commit ( if a fault , for he really give very praise - worthy motive for he dispensation ) will not be laid at he own door . so e'en resolve , my dearest child , to submit to it , and with cheerfulness too . send you a happy hour ! but who know , when the time come , whether it may not be proper to dispense with this duty , as you deem it , on other account ? for every young person be not enable to perform it . so , to show he honour , that you will cheerfully acquiesce , you dear mother advise you to look out for a wholesome , good - humoured , honest body , as near you complexion and temper , and constitution , as may be ; and it may not be the worse , she think , if she be twenty , or one -- or two - and - twenty ; for she will have more strength and perfection , as one may say , than even you can have at you tender age : and , above all , for the wise reason you give from you reading , that she may be bring to - be much about you time , if possible . we can look out , about we , for such a one . and , as be not adverse to have the dear child in the house , you will have as much delight , and the dear baby may fare as well , under you prudent and careful eye , as if you be oblige in the way you would choose . so direct you , my child , in all you way , and make you acquiesce in this point with cheerfulness ( although , as you say , one can not believe , as one pleasis ; for we verily be of opinion you safely may , as matter stand ) and continue to you , and you honoure husband , health , and all manner of happiness , be the prayer of _you most affectionate father and mother ,_ _and_ . I thank you , my dearest parent , for you kind letter ; it be give to . and he bring it to I himself , and be angry with I : indeed he be , as you shall hear : " 'Tis from the good couple , my dear , I see . I hope they be of my opinion -- but whether they be or not -- but I will leave you ; and do you , , step down to my closet , when you have peruse it . " he be pleased to withdraw ; and I read it , and sit down , and consider it well ; but , as you know i make it always my maxim to do what I could not avoid to do , with as good a grace as possible , I wait on the dear gentleman . " well , , " say he , a little seriously , " what say the worthy pair ? " " of ! they declare for you . they say , it be best for I to yield up this point . " " they be certainly in the right -- but be you not a dear perverse creature , to give I all this trouble about you saucy scruple ? " " , , do not call they so , " say I , little think he be displease with I . " I still be somewhat waver ; though they advise I to acquiesce ; and , as it be you will , and you have determine , it be my duty to yield up the point . " " but do you yield it up cheerfully , my dear ? " " I do , ; and will never more dispute it , let what will happen . and I beg pardon for have so often enter into this subject with you . but you know , , if one 's weakness of mind give one scruple , one should not yield implicitly , till they be satisfied ; for that would look as if one give not you the obedience of a free mind . " " you be very obliging , _just now , my dear ; but I can tell you , you have make I half serious ; yet I would not show it , in compliment to you present condition ; for I do not expect that you would have think any appeal necessary , though to you parent , in a point that I be determine upon , as you must see , every time we talk of it . " this struck I all in a heap . I look down to the ground : have no courage to look up to he face , for fear I should behold he aspect as mortify to I as he word . but he take both my hand , and draw I kindly to he , and salute I , " excuse I , my dearest love : I be not angry with you . why start this precious pearl
pearl ? " and kiss my cheek : " speak to I , ! " " I will , -- I will -- as soon as I can : " for this be my first check , so seriously give , my heart be full . but as I know he would be angry , and think I obstinate , if I do not speak , I say , full of concern , " I wish , -- I wish -- you have be pleased to spare I a little longer , for the same kind , very kind , consideration . " " but be it not better , my dear , to tell you I _be a little out of humwe with you , than that I _am _?-- but you be very earnest with I on this point more than once ; and you put I upon a hate , because ungenerous , necessity of plead my prerogative , as I call it ; yet this would not do , but you appeal against I in the point I be determine upon , for reason altogether in you favour : and if this be not like my , excuse I , that I could not help be a little unlike myself . " " ah ! " think I , " this be not so very unlike you dear self , be I to give the least shadow of a occasion ; for it be of a piece with you lesson formerly . " " I be sure , " say I , " I be not in the least aware , that I have offend . but I be too little circumspect . I have be use to you goodness for so long a time , that I expect it , it seem ; and think I be sure of you favourable construction . " " why , so you may be , my dear , in every thing _almost _. but I do not love to speak twice my mind on the same subject ; you know I do not ! and you have really dispute this point with I five or six time ; insomuch , that I wonder what be come to my dearest . " " I think , , you would have distinguished between a command where my _conscience_ be concerned , and a _common point : you know . , I never have any will but yours in _common point . but , indeed , you make I fearful because my task be render too difficult for my own weak judgment . " I be silent , but by my tear . " now , I doubt , , you spirit be high . you will not speak , because you be out of humwe at what I say . I will have no sullen reserve , my dearest . what mean that heaive sob ? I know that this be the time with you sex , when , sadden with you apprehension , and indulge because of they , by the fond husband , it be needful , for both they sake , to watch over the change of they temper . for lady in you way be often like encroach subject ; apt to extend what they call they privileges , on the indulgence shew they ; and the husband never again recover the ascendant he have before . " " you know these thing better than , . but I have no intention to invade you province , or to go out of my own . yet I think I have a right to a little free will , on some greater occasion . " " why , so you have , my dear . but you must not plead in behalf of you own will , and refuse to give due weight to mine . " " well , , I must need say , I have one advantage above other of my sex ; for if wife , in my circumstance , be apt to grow upon indulgence , I be very happy that you kind and watchful care will hinder I from fall into that error . " he give I a gentle tap on the neck : " let I beat my beloved sauce - box , " say he : " be it thus you rally my watchful care over you for you own good ? but tell I , truly , , be you not a little sullen ? look up to I , my dear . be you not ? " " I believe I be ; but ' tis but very little , . it will soon go off . please to let I withdraw , that I may take myself to task about it ; - for at present , I know not what to do , because I do not expect the displeasure I have incur . " " be it not the same thing , " reply he , " if this we first quarrel end here , without you withdrawing ?-- I forgive you heartily , my ; and give I one kiss , and I will think of you saucy appeal against I no more . " " I will comply with you condition , Sir ; but I have a great mind to be saucy . I wish you would let I for this once . " " what would you say , my dearest ?-- be saucy then , as you call it , as saucy as you can . " " why ; then I _be a little sullen at present , that I be ; and I be not fully convince , whether it must be I that forgive you , or you I . for , indeed , if I can recollect , I can not think my fault so
so great in this point , that be a point of conscience to I , as ( pardon I ) , to stand in need of you forgiveness . " " well , then , my dearest , " say he , " we will forgive one another ? but take this with you , that it be my love to you that make I more delicate than otherwise I should be ; and you have inure I so much to a faultless conduct , that I can hardly bear with natural infirmity from you .-- but , " give I another tap , " get you go ; I leave you to you recollection ; and let I know what fruit it produce : for I must not be put off with a half - compliance ; I must have you whole will with I , if possible . " so I go up , and recollect every thing , _sacrifice to my sex , as . call it , when he talk of a wife 's reluctance to yield a favourite point : for I shed many tear , because my heart be set upon it . and so , my dear parent , twenty charme idea and pleasure I have form to myself , be vanish from I , and my measure be quite broken . but after my heart be relieve by my eye , I be lighter and easier . and the result be , we have hear of a good sort of woman , that be to be my poor _baby 's mother , when it come ; so you kindly - offer enquiry be needless , I believe . ' Tis well for we sex in general , that there be not many husband who distinguish thus nicly . for , I doubt , there be but very few so well entitle to they lady 's observance as be to mine , and who would act so generously and so tenderly by a wife as he do , in every material instance on which the happiness of life depend . but we be quite reconcile ; although as I say , upon he own term : and so I can still style myself , _my dear honoured parent , you happy , as well as you dutiful daughter , from to ._ my dear Pamela , I have send you a present , the completest I could procure , of every thing that may suit you approaching happy circumstance ; as I hope it will be to you , and to we all : but it be with a hope annex , that although both sex be think of in it , you will not put we off with a girl : no , child , we will not permit you , may we have we will , to _think_ of give we a girl , till you have present we with half a dozen fine boy . for we line be go so low , we expect that human security from you in you first seven year , or we shall be disappoint . I will now give you they name , if my brother and you approve of they : you first shall be Billy ; my , and the of ----, godfather ; and it must be doubly godmother too , or I be afraid the countess and I shall fall out about it . you second Daver ; be sure remember that .-- you third , CHARLEy ; you fourth , Jemmy ; you fifth , Harry ; you sixth -- Dudley , if you will -- and you girl , if you have not rather call it , shall be call .-- the rest name as you please .-- and so , my dear , I wish all seven happily over with you . I be glad you get safe to town : and long to hear of 's arrival , because I know you will be out of you bia in you new settlement till then . she be a fine lady , and write the most to my taste of any one of she sex that I know , next to you . I wish she would be so kind as to correspond with I . but be sure do not omit to give I the sequel of she sister 's and 's affair , and what you think will please I in relation to she .- you do well to save yourself the trouble of describe the town and the public place . we be no stranger to they ; and they be too much we table talk , when any country lady have for the first time be carry to town , and return : besides , what affords , be nothing that deserve mention , compare to what we have see at and at versaille , and other of the french palace . you exactly , therefore , hit we taste , and answer we expectation , when you give we , in you peculiar manner , sentiment on what we may call the _soul of thing , and such character as you draw with a pencil borrowed from the hand of nature , intermingle with those fine light and shade of reflection and observation , that make you picture glow , and instruct as well as delight . there , , be encouragement for you to proceed in oblige we . we be all of one mind in this respect ; and more than ever , since we have see you action so well answer to you writings ; and that theory and practice , as to every excellence that can adorn a lady , be the same thing with you . we be pleased with you lawyer 's characters . there be life and nature in they ; but never avoid give
give all that occur to you , for that seem to be one of you talents ; and in the ugliest , there will be matter of instruction ; especially as you seem naturally to fall upon such as be so general , that no one who converse , but must see in they the picture of one or other he be acquaint with . by this time , perhaps , will be with you yo.--Ou respect to she , if so .-- and you will have be at some of the theatrical entertainment : so will not want subjects to oblige we .--'Tbe a good thought of you dear man 's , to carry you to see the several house , and to make you a judge , by that mean , of the disposition and fashion of every thing in they .- tell he , I love he better and better . I be proud of my brother , and do nothing but talk of what a charme husband he make . but then , he give a example to all who know he , and he uncontrollable temper ( which make against many of we ) , that it be possible for a good wife to make even a bad man a worthy husband : and this afford a instruction , which may stand all we sex in good stead . -- but then they must have be cautious first , to choose a man of natural good sense , and good manners , and not a brutal or abandoned debauchee . but hark - ye - I , my sweet girl , what have I do , that you will not write yourself _sister to I ? I could find in my heart to be angry with you . before my last visit , I be scrupulous to subscribe myself so to _you_. but since I have see myself so much surpass in every excellence , that I would take pleasure in the name , you assume a pride in you turn , and may think it under - value yourself , to call _me_ so -- ay , that be the thing , I doubt -- although I have endeavoure by several regulation since my return ( and the countess , too , keep you example in distant view , as well as I ) , to be more worthy of the appellation . if , therefore , you would avoid the reproach of secret pride , under the shadow of so remarkable a humility , for the future never omin subscrib as I do , with great pleasure , _your truly affectionate sister and friend , benefit . Daver . I always take it for grant , that my worthy brother send he respects to we ; as you must , that , the Countess of and ( who , as well as he uncle , talk of nothing else but you ) , send theirs ; and so unnecessary compliment will be always exclude we correspondence . in answer to the preceding ._ how you overwhelm I with you goodness , my dearest lady , in every word of you last welcome letter , be beyond my power to express I how nobly have you ladyship contrive , in you ever - value present , to encourage a doubting and apprehensive mind ! and how do it contribute to my joy and my glory , that I be deem by the noble sister of my best belove , not wholly unworthy of be the humble means to continue , and , perhaps , to perpetuate , a family so ancient and so honourable ! when I contemplate this , and look upon what I be -- how shall I express a sense of the honour do I !-- and when , read over the other engage particular in you ladyship 's letter , I come to the last charming paragraph , I be doubly affect to see myself seemingly upbraided , but so politely embolden to assume a appellation , that otherwise I hardly da . I -- _humble I -- who never have a sister before -- to find one now in Lady Davers ! of Madam , you , and _only you , can teach I word fit to express the joy and the gratitude that fill my delighted heart ! -- but thus much I be teach , that there be some thing more than the low - born can imagine in birth and education . this be so evident in you ladyship 's action , word , and manner , that it strike one with a become reverence ; and we look up with awe to a condition we emulate in vain , when raise by partial favour , like what I have find ; and be confound when we see grandeur of soul join with grandeur of birth and condition ; and a noble lady act thus nobly , as act . my best wish , and a thousand blessing , attend you ladyship in all you undertake ! and I be persuade the latter will , and a peace and satisfaction of mind incomparably to be prefer to whatever else this world can afford , in the new regulation , which you , and my dear lady countess , have set on foot in you family : and when I can have the happiness to know what they be , I shall , I be confident , greatly improve my own methods by they . be we to live for ever in this life , we might be careless and indifferent about these matters : but when such a uncertainty as to the time , and such a certainty as to the event be before we , a prudent mind will be always prepare , till prepare ; and what can be a better preparative , than charitable
charitable action to we fellow - creature in the eye of that Majesty , which want nothing of we himself , but to do just the merciful thing to one another . pardon I , my dearest lady , for this my free style . Methinks I be out of myself ! I know not how to descmend all at once from the height to which you have raise I : and you must forgive the reflection to which you yourself and you own noble action have give birth . here , have take respite a little , I naturally sink into _body again .-- and will not you ladyship confine you expectation from I within narrower limit ?-- for , o , I can not even with my wish , so swiftly follow you expectation , if such they be ! but , however , leave futurity to , who only govern futurity , and who conduct we all , and we affair , as shall best answer he own divine purpose , I will proceed as well as I can , to obey you in those article , which be , at present , more within my own power . my dear , then , let I acquaint you ladyship , arrive on last : she have give we notice , by a line , of the day she set out ; and and see she ten mile on the way to the stage coach in 's coach , attend she on horseback . they part with she , as be easy to guess from she merit , with great tenderness ; and we be to look upon the visit ( as we do ) as a high favour from she papa and mamma ; who , however , charge she not to exceed a month in and out , which I regret much . kindly propose to I , as she come in the stage coach , attend with one maid - servant , to meet she part of the way in he coach and six , if , as he be pleased to say , it would not be too fatiguing to I ; and we would go so early , as to dine at 's . I gladly consent , and we get thither about one o'clock ; and while dinner be prepare , he be pleased to show I the great church there , and the curiious vault of the good of , and also the monument of the great in 's church ; all which , no doubt , you ladyship have see . there happen to be six passenger in the stage coach , include and she maid ; she be exceed glad to be relieve from they , though the weather be cold enough , two of the passenger be not very agreeable company , one a rough military man , and the other a positive humoursome old gentlewoman : and the other two sister --" who jangle now and then , " say she , " as much as _my_ sister , and my sister 's _sister _. " judge how joyful this meeting be to we both . be no less delighted , and say , he be infinitely oblige to for this precious trust . " I come with double pleasure , " say she , " to see the greatest curiosity in , a husband and wife , who have not , in so many month as you have be married , if I may believe report , and you letter , , once repent . " " you be severe , , " reply , " upon people in the married state : I hope there be many such instance . " " there might , if there be more such husband as make .-- I hate you once , and think you very wicked ; but I revere you now . " " if you will _revere_ any body , my dear , " say he , " let it be this good girl ; for it be all owe to she conduct and direction , that I make a tolerable husband : be there more such wife , I be persuade , there would be more such husband than there be . " " you see , my dear , " say I , " what it be to be wed to a generous man . , by he noble treatment of I , create a merit in I , and disclaim the natural effect of he own goodness . " " well , you be a charming couple -- person and mind . I know not any equal either of you have .-- but , , I will not compliment you too highly . I may make _you_ proud , for man be saucy creature ; but I can not make you _lady so : and in this doubt of the one , and confidence in the other , I must join with you , that she merit be the greatest .-- since , excuse I , , she example have reform she rake ; and you have only confirm in she the virtue you find ready form to you hand . " " that distinction , " say , " be worthy of 's judgment . " " my dearest -- my dearest , " say I , lay my hand upon the hand of each , " how can you go on thus ! -- as I look upon every kind thing , two such dear friend say of I , as incentive for I to endeaavor to deserve it , you must not ask I too high ; for then , instead of encouraging , you will make I despair . " he lead we into the coach ; and in a free , easy , joyful manner , not in
in the least tired or fatigue , do we reach the town and . house ; with which and its furniture , and the apartment allot for she , my dear friend be highly pleased . but the dear lady put I into some little confusion , when she see I first , take notice of my _improvement , as she call they , before . I look at he and she with a downcast eye . he smile , and say , " would you , my good , look so silly , after such a length of time , with a husband you need not be asham of ? " " no , indeed , , not I , I will assure you ; nor will I forgive those maiden air in a wife so happy as you be . " I say nothing . but I wish myself , in mind and behaviour , to be just what be . but , my dear lady , have have those early advantage from conversation , which I have not ; and so must never expect to know how to deport myself with that modest freedom and ease , which I know I want , and shall always want , although some of my partial favourer think I do not . for I be every day more and more sensible of the great difference there be between be use to the politest conversation as a inferior , and be bear to bear a part in it : in the one , all be set , stiff , awkward , and the person just such a ape of imitation as poor I ; in the other , all be natural ease and sweetness -- like . know this , I do not indeed aim at what I be sensible I can not attain ; and so , I hope , be less exposed to censure than I should be if I do . for , I have hear . observe with regard to gentleman who build fine house , make fine garden , and open fine prospect , that art should never take place of , but be subservient to , nature ; and a gentleman , if confin to a situation , have better conform he design to that , than to do as at , level a mountain at a monstrous expense ; which , have it be suffer to remain , in so wild and romantic a scene as affords , might have be make one of the greatest beautie of the place . so I think I have better endeavour to make the best of those natural defect I can not master , than , by assume air and dignity in appearance , to which I be not bear , act neither part tolerably . by this means , instead of be think neither gentlewoman nor rustic , as hint ( _linsey - wolsey , I think be he term too ) , I may be look upon as a original in my way ; and all original pass well enough , you know , Madam , even with judge . now I be upon this subject , I can form to myself , if you ladyship will excuse I , two such polite gentleman as my lawyer mention in my former , who , with a true magnanimity and penetration ( for , Madam , I fancy you critic will be the severest upon the country girl ) , will put on mighty significant look , forget , it may be , that they have any fault themselves , and apprehend that they have nothing to do , but to sit in judgment upon other , one of they express himself after this manner -- " why , truly , , the girl be well enough --_considering _-- I can not say -- " ( then a pinch of snuff , perhaps , add importance to he air ) --" but a man might love she for a month or two . " ( these spark talk thus of other lady before I . ) " she behave better than I expect from she --_consider _-- " again will follow . " so I think , " cry the other , and toss he tie behind he , with a air partly of contempt , and partly of rakery . " as you say . , I expect to find a awkward country girl , but she top she part , I will assure you !-- Nay , for that matter , behave very tolerably for what she be _-- and be right , not to seem desirous to dry the remembrance of she original in she elevation -- and , I can not but say " ( for something like it he do say ) , " be mighty pretty , and passably genteel . " and thus with they poor praise of .' girl , they think they have make a fine compliment to he judgment . but for _his_ sake ( for as to my own , I be not solicitous about such gentleman 's good opinion ) , I owe they a spite ; and believe , I shall find a opportunity to come out of they debt . for I have the vanity to think , now you have make I proud by you kind encouragement and approbation , that the country girl will make them look about they , with all they _genteel contempt , which they miscall _praise . but how I run on ! you ladyship expect that I shall write as freely to you as I use to do to my parent . I have the merit of obey you , that I have ; but , I doubt , too much to the exercise of you patience . this ( like all mine ) be a
a long letter ; and I will only add to it 's humble respects , and thanks for you ladyship 's kind mention of she , which she receive as no small honour . and now . madam , with a greater pleasure than I can express , will I make use of the liberty you so kindly allow I to take , of subscrib myself with that profound respect which become I , _you ladyship 's most obliged sister , and obedient servant ,_ P.B. , , and , be just arrive ; and we household be now complete . from to ._ my , after I have thank you for you last agreeable letter , which have add the and to the number of you admirer ( you know , she sister , be so before ) , I shall tell you , that I now write , at they request , as well as at those of my , the countess you so dearly love , and , for you decision of a odd dispute , that , on read you letter , and talk of you domestic excellency , happen among we . say , that , notwithstand any awkwardness you attribute to yourself , she can not but decide , by all she have see of you writings , and hear from we , that yours be the perfectest character she ever find in the sex . the countess say , that you wrong yourself in suppose you be not every thing that be polite and genteel , as well in you behaviour , as in you person ; and that she know not any lady in who better become she station than you do . " why , then , " say , " . must be quite perfect : that be certain . " so say the earl ; so say they all . and confirm that you be . yet , as we be sure , there can not be such a character in this life as have not one fault , although we could not tell where to fix it , the countess make a whimsical motion : " , " say she , " pray do you write to . . and acquaint she with we subject ; and as it be impossible , for one who can act as she do , not to know herself better than any body else can do , desire she to acquaint we with some of those secret foible , that leave room for she to be still more perfect . " " a good thought , " say they all . and this be the present occasion of my writing ; and pray see that you accuse yourself , of no more than you know yourself guilty : for over-modesty border nearly on pride , and too liberal self - accusation be generally but so many trap for acquittal with applause : so that ( whatever other lady might ) you will not be forgive , if you deal with we in a way so poorly artful ; let you fault , therefore , be such as you think we can subscribe to , from what we have _seen_ of _you_ and what we have _read of _your ; and you must try to extenuate they too , as you give they , lest we should think you above that nature , which , in the _best_ case , be you undoubted talent . I congratulate you and on she arrival : she be a charming young lady ; but tell she , that we shall not allow she to take you at you word , and to think that she excel you in any one thing : only , indeed , we think you nicer in some point than you need be to , as to you present agreeable circumstance . and yet , let I tell you , that the easy , unaffected , conjugal purity , in word and behaviour , between you good man and you , be worthy of imitation , and what the countess and I have with pleasure contemplate since we leave you , a hundred time , and admire in you both : and it be good policy too , child , as well as high decorum ; for it be what will make you ever new and respectful to one another . but _you have the honour of it all , whose sweet , natural , and easy modesty , in person , behaviour , and conversation , forbid indecency , even in thought , much more in word , to approach you : insomuch that no rake can be rake in you presence , and yet they hardly know to what they owe they restraint . however , as people who see you at this time , will take it for grant that you and . have be very intimate together , I should think you need not be asham of you appearance , because , as he rightly observe , you have no reason to be asham of you husband . excuse my pleasantry , my dear : and answer we demand upon you , as soon as you can ; which will oblige we all ; particularly _you affectionate sister , benefit . Daver . my , what a task have you impos upon I ! and accord to the term you annex to it , how shall I acquit myself of it , without incurr the censure of affectation , if I freely accuse myself as I may deserve , or of vanity , if I do not ? indeed , Madam , I have a great many failings : and you do not know the pain it cost I to keep they under ; not so much for fear the world should see they , for I bless God
God , I can hope they be not capital , as for fear they should become capital , if I be to let they grow upon I . and this , surely , I need not have tell you ladyship , and the Countess of , who have read my papers , and see my behaviour in the kind visit you make to you dear brother , and have from _both but too much reason to censure I , do not you generous and partial favour make you overlook my greater failings , and pass under a kinder name many of my lesser ; for surly , my good lady , you must both of you have observe , in what you have read and see , that I be naturally of a saucy temper : and with all my appearance of meekness and humility , can resent , and s too , when I think myself provoke . I have also discover in myself , on many occasion ( of some of which I will by - and - by remind you ladyship ) , a malignancy of heart , that , it be true , last but a little while -- nor have it need -- but for which I have often call myself to account -- to very little purpose hitherto . and , indeed , ( now for a little extenuation , as you expect from I ) , I have some difficulty , whether I ought to take such pain to subdue myself in some instance , in the station to which I be raise , that otherwise it would have become I to attempt to do : for it be no easy task , for one in my circumstance , to distinguish between the _otch and the _otch not ; to be humble without meanness , and decent without arrogance . and if all person think as justly as I flatter myself I do , of the inconvenience , as well as convenience , which attend they be raise to a condition above they , they would not imagine all the world be they own , when they come to be distinguished as I have be : for , what with the contempt of superior relation on one side , the envy of the world , and low reflection arise from it , on the other , from which no one must hope to be totally exempt , and the awkwardness , besides , with which they support they elevate condition , if they have sense to judge of they own imperfection ; and if the gentleman be not such a one as mine --( and where will such another be found ? ) --On all these account , I say , they will be make sensible , that , whatever they might once think , happiness and a high estate be two very different thing . but I shall be too grave , when you ladyship , and all my kind and noble friend , expect , perhaps , I should give the uncommon subject a pleasanter air : yet what must that mind be , that be not serious , when oblige to recollect , and give account of its defects ? but I must not only accuse myself , it seem , I must give _proof , such as you ladyship can subscribe to , of my imperfection . there be so much _real kindness in this _seem hardship , that I will obey you . madam , and produce proof in a moment , which can not be controvert . as to my _sauciness , those papers will give a hundred instance against I , as well to you dear brother , as to other . indeed , to extenuate , as you command I , as I go along , these be mostly when I be apprehensive for my honour , they be . and then , I have a little tincture of _jealousy , which sometimes have make I more uneasy than I ought to be , as the papers you have not see would have demonstrate , particularly in 's case , and in my conversation with you ladyship , in which I have frequently betraye my fear of what might happen when in : yet , to extenuate again , I have examine myself very strictly on this head ; and really think , that I can ascribe a great part of this jealousy to laudable motive ; no less than to my concern for you dear brother 's future happiness , in the hope , that I may be a humble means , through , to induce he to abhor those crime of which young gentleman too often be guilty , and bring he over to the practice of those virtue , in which he will ever have cause to rejoice . -- , my lady , some other part of the charge must stand against I ; for as i love he person , as well as he mind , I have pride in my jealousy , that would not permit I , I verily think , to support myself as I ink , under trial of a competition , in this very tender point . and this oblige I to own , that I have a little spark -- not a little one , perhaps of _secret pride_ and _vanity , that will arise , now and then , on the honour do I ; but which i keep under as much as I can ; and to this pride , let I tell you ladyship , I know no one contribute , or can contribute , more largely than yourself . so you see , my dear lady , what a naughty heart I have , and how far I be from be a faultless creature -- I hope I shall be better
better and better , however , as I live longer , and have more grace , and more wit : for here to recapitulate my fault , be in the first place , _vindictiveness , I will not call it downright revenge -- and how much room do all these leave for amendment , and greater perfection ? have you ladyship , and the countess , favour we longer in you kind visit , I must have so improved , by you charming conversation , and by that natural ease and dignity which accompany everything you ladyship do and say , as to have get over such of these foible as be not root in nature : till in time I have be able to do more than emulate those perfection , which at present , I can only at a awful distance revere ; as become , _my dear lady , you most humble admirer , and oblige servant , * * * * * from to she and . my ever - Honoured PAPa and , I arrive safely in on , after a tolerable journey , consider and I make six in the coach ( two have be take up on the way , after you leave I ) , and none of the six highly agreeable . . and he lady , who look very stately upon we ( from the circumstance of _person , rather than of _mind , however ) , be so good as to meet I at 's , in they coach and six . they have a fine house here , richly furnish in every part , and have allot I the best apartment in it . we be happy beyond expression . be a charming husband ; so easy , so pleased with , and so tender of he lady : and she so much all that we see she in the country , as to humility and affability , and improve in every thing else which we hardly think possible she could be -- that I never know so happy a matrimony .-- all that _prerogative sauciness , which we apprehend would so eminently display itself in he behaviour to he wife , have she be ever so distinguished by birth and fortune , be vanished . I do not think it be in the power of a angel , if we sex could have produce one , to have make so tender and so fond a husband of as he make . and should I have the sense to follow . . 's example , if ever I marry , I should not despair of make myself happy , let it be to whom it would , provide he be not a brute , nor sordo in he temper ; which two character be too obvious to be conceal , if person take due care , and make proper inquiry , and if they be not lead by blind passion . and make just such a happy pair ! you command I , my honoured mamma , to write to you a account of every thing that please I -- I say I would : but what a task should I then have !-- I do not think I have undertake to write volume .-- you must therefore allow I to be more brief than I have intend . in the first place , it would take up five or six long letter to do justice to the economy observe in this happy family . you know that . . have not change one of she servants , and only add she Polly to they . this be a unexampled thing , especially as they be she _fellow - servants as we may say : but since they have the sense to admire so good a example , and be proud to follow it , each to he and she power , I think it one of she peculiar facility to have continue they , and to choose to reform such as be exceptionable rather than dismiss they . they mouth , tell I , be continually full of they lady 's praise , and prayer , and blessing , uttere with such delight and fervour for the happy pair , that it make she eye , she say , ready to run over to hear they . moreover , I think it a extraordinary degree of policy ( whether design or not ) to keep they , as they be all worthy folk ; for have she turn they off , what have she do but make as many enemie as she have discard servants ; and as many more as those have friend and acquaintance ? and we all know , how much the reputation of family lie at the mercy of servants ; and it be easy to guess to what cause each would have impute he or she dismission . and so she have escape , as she ink , the censure of pride ; and make every one , instead of reproach she with she descent , find those graces in she , which turn that very disadvantage to she glory . she be exceedingly affable ; always speak to they with a smile ; but yet have such a dignity in she manner , that it secure she they respect and reverence ; and they be ready to fly at a look , and seem proud to have she command to execute ; insomuch , that the word --" _my lady command so , or so , " from one servant to another , be sure to meet with a indisputable obedience , be the duty require what it will . if any of they be the least indispose , she care and tenderness for they engage the veneration and gratitude of all the rest , who see how kindly they will be
be treat , should they ail any thing themselves . and in all this she be very happy in , who be a excellent second to she admirable lady ; and be treat by she with as much respect and affection , as if she be she mother . you may remember , Madam , that in the account she give we of she _benevolent round , as call it , she say , that as she be go to , she should instruct about some of she _client , as I find she call she poor , to avoid a word which she delicacy account harsh with regard to they , and ostentatious with respect to herself . I ask she , how ( since , contrary to she then expectation , be permit to be in town with she ) she have provide to answer she intention as to those she client , whom she have refer to the care of that good woman ? she say , that , she apothecary , be a very worthy man , and she have give he a plenary power in that particular , and likewise desire he to recommend any new and worthy case to she that no deserving person among the destitute sick poor , might be unrelieve by reason of she absence . and here in she have apply herself to Dr.----( she parish minister , a fine preacher , and sound divine , who promise on all opportunity to pay he respects to ) to recommend to she any poor housekeeper , who would be glad to accept of some private benefaction , and yet , have live creditably , till reduce by misfortune , be asham to apply for public relief : and she have several of these already on she _benevolent list , to some of whom she send coal now at the entrance on the wintry season , to some a piece of irish or scottish linen , or so many yard of Norwich stuff , for gown and coat for the girl , or cloth for the boy ; and money to some , who she be most assure will lay it out with care . and she have moreover _mortify , as the call it , one hundred and fifty pound as a fund for loans , without interest , of five , ten , or fifteen , but not exceed twenty pound , to answer some present exigence in some honest family , who find the best security they can , to repay it in a give time ; and this fund , she purpose , as she grow richer , she say , to increase ; and estimate pleasantly she worth by this sum , say sometimes , " who would ever have think I should have be worth one hundred and fifty pound so soon ? I shall be a rich body in time . " but in all these thing , she enjoin secresy , which the doctor have promise . she tell the doctor what 's office be in she family ; and hope , she say , he would give she he sanction to it ; assure he , that she think it she duty to ask it , as she be one of he flock , and he , on that account , she principal shepherd , which make a spiritual relation between they , the requisite of which , on she part , be not to be dispense with . the good gentleman very cheerfully and applaudingly give he consent ; and when she tell he how well be provide for , and that she would apply to he to supply she with a town chaplain , when she be deprive of he , he wish that the other duty of he function ( for he have a large parish ) would permit he to be the happy person himself , say , that till she be supply to she mind , either he or he curate would take care that so laudable a method should be keep up . you will do I the justice , Madam , to believe , that I very cheerfully join in my dear friend 's duty ; and I be not a little edified , with the good example , and the harmony and good - while that this excellent method preserve in the family . I must own I never see such a family of love in my life : for here , under the eye of the best of mistress , they twice every see one another all together ( as they use to do in the country ) , superior as well as inferior servants ; and tell I , after and I be withdrawn , there be such friendly salutation among they , that she never hear the like -- " you servant , good master Longman :" -- " you servant , master , " cry one and another :--" how do you , ? " --" I be glad to see you , ! " --" all blessedly meet once more ! " cry , the venerable butler , with he silver hair , as always distinguish he :--" Good Madam , " cry another , " you look purely this bless day , thank ! " and they return to they several vocation , so light , so easy , so pleased , so even - tempere in they minds , as they cheerful countenance , as well as expression , testify , that it be a heaven of a house : and be wound up thus constantly once a week , at least , like a good eight - day clock , no piece of machinery that ever be make be so regular and uniform as this family be . what a example do this dear lady set to all
all who see she , know she , and who hear of she ; how happy they who have the to follow it ! what a public blessing would such a mind as hers be , could it be ves with the rob of royalty , and adorn the sovereign dignity ! but what be the prince of the earth , look at they in every nation , and what they have be for ag past , compare to this lady ? who act from the impulse of she own heart , unaided in most case , by any human example . in short , when I contemplate she innumerable excellency , and that sweetness of temper , and universal benevolence , which shine in every thing she say and do , I can not sometimes help look upon she in the light of a angel , drop down from heaven , and receive into bodily organ , to live among man and woman , in order to show what the first of the species be design to be . and , here , be the admiration , that one see all these duty perform in such a easy and pleasant manner , as any body may perform they ; for they interfere not with any part of the family management ; but rather ay and inspirit every one in the discharge of all they domestic service ; and , moreover , keep they mind in a state of preparation for the more solemn duty of the day ; and all without the least intermixture of affectation , enthusiasm , or ostentation . of my dear papa and mamma , permit I but to tarry here till I be perfect in all these good lesson , and how happy shall I be ! as to the town , and the diversion of it , I shall not trouble you with any account , as , from you former thorough knowledge of both , you will want no information about they ; for , generally speak , all who reside constantly in , allow , that there be little other difference in the diversion of one winter and another , than such as be in clothes ; a few variation of the fashions only , which be mostly owe to the ingenious contrivance of person who be to get they bread by diversify they . . have undertake to give a account of the matters as they pass , and she sentiment on what she see . there must be something new in she observation , because she be a stranger to these diversion , and unbiass entirely by favour or prejudice ; and so will not play the partial critic , but give to a beauty its due praise , and to a fault its due censure , accord to that truth and nature which be the unerring guide of she action as well as sentiment . these I will transcribe for you ; and you will be so good as to return they when peruse , because I will lend they , as I use to do she letter , to she good parent ; and so I shall give she a pleasure at the same time in the accommodate they with the knowledge of all that pass , which she make it a point of duty to do , because they take delight in she writings . my papa 's observation , that a woman never take a journey but she forget something , be justifi by I ; for , with all my care , I have leave my diamond buckle , which will find in the inner till of my bureau , wrapt up in cotton ; and I beg it may be send I by the first opportunity . with my humble duty to you both , my dear indulgent papa and mamma , thanks for the favour I now rejoice in , and affectionate respects to ( I wish she would love I as well as I love she ) , and service to , and all we good neighbour , conclude _me you dutiful , and highly - favour daughter , Darnford . and , desire they compliment of congratulation to and , on the marriage of they worthy niece ; also to you honoured selve they desire they kind respects and thanks for the loan of you worthless daughter . I experience every hour some new token of they politeness and affection ; and I make no scruple to think I be with such a brother , and such a sister as any happy creature may rejoice in , and be proud of . . I can not but repeat , be a charming husband , and a most polite gentleman . he lady be always accuse herself to I of awkwardness and insufficiency ; but not a soul who see she can find it out ; she be all genteel ease ; and the admiration of every one who behold she . only I tell she , with such happiness in possession , she be a little of the gravest sometimes . from to ._ my good lady , you command I to acquaint you with the proceeding between and : and make it easy for I to obey you in this particular , and in very few word ; for she say , every thing be adjust before she come away , and the ceremony , she believe , may be perform by this time . she rejoice that she be out of the way of it : for , she say , love be so awkward a thing to , and good - humour so uncommon a one to , that she hope she shall never see such another courtship . we have be at the play - house several time ; and , give I leave to say ,
, Madam , ( for I have now read as well as see several ) , that I think the stage , by proper regulation , might be make a profitable amusement . -- but nothing more convinces one of the truth of the common observation , that the best thing , corrupt , prove the worst , than these representation . the terror and compunction for evil deed , the compassion for a just distress , and the general beneficence which those lively exhibition be so capable of raise in the human mind , might be of great service , when direct to right end , and induce by proper motive : particularly where the action which the catastrophe be design to punish , be not set in such advantageous light , as shall destroy the end of the moral , and make the vice that ought to be censure , imitable ; where instruction be keep in view all the way , and where vice be punish , and virtue reward . but give I leave to say , that I think there be hardly one play I have see , or read hithertoo , but have too much of love in it , as that passion be generally treat . how unnatural in some , how inflam in other , be the description of it !-- in most , rather rant and fury , like the love of the fiercer brute animal , as , translate by , describe they , than the soft , sigh , fearfully hopeful murmur , that swell the bosom of we gentler sex : and the respectful , timorous , submissive complainings of the other , when the truth of the passion humanize , as one may say , they more rugged heart . in particular , what strange indelicate do these writer of tragedy often make of we sex ! they do not enter into the passion at all , if I have any notion of it ; but when the authors want to paint it strongly ( at least in those play I have see and read ) they aim seem to raise a whirlwind , as I may say , which sweep down reason , religion , and decency ; and carry every laudable duty away before it ; so that all the example can serve to shew be , how a disappointed lover may rage and storm , resent and revenge . the play I first see be the tragedy of the Distressed mother ;_ and a great many beautiful thing I think there be in it : but half of it be a tempestuous , cruel , ungoverned rant of passion , and end in cruelty , bloodsh , and desolation , which the truth of the story not warrant , as . tell I , make it the more pity , that the original author ( for it be a french play , translate , you know , ) , have not conduct it , since it be he choice , with less terror , and with greater propriety , to the passion intend to be raise , and actually raise in many place . but the epilogue speak after the play , by , in the character of , be more shocking to I , than the most terrible part of the play ; as by lewd and even senseless _double entendre , it could be calculate only to efface all the tender , all the virtuous sentiment , which the tragedy be design to raise . the pleasure this give the man be equally barbarous and insult ; all turn to the box , pit , and galleries , where lady were , to see how they look , and stand a emphatical and too - well pronounce ridicule , not only upon the play in general , but upon the part of Andromache in particular , which have be so well sustain by a excellent actress ; and I be extremely mortified to see my favourite ( and the only perfect ) character debase and despoil , and the widow of Hector , prince of , talk nastiness to a audience , and set it out with all the wick graces of action , and affect archness of look , attitude , and emphasis . I stand up -- " dear Sir !-- dear miss ! " say I . " what be the matter , my love ? " say smile . " why have I weep the distress of the injured Hermione ? " whisper I : " why have I be move by the murder of the brave Pyrrhus , and shock by the madness of Orestes ! be it for this ? see you not Hector 's widow , the noble Andromache , invert the design of the whole play , satirize she own sex , but indeed most of all ridicule and sham , in _my mind , that part of the audience , who can be deligh with this vile epilogue , after such scene of horror and distress ? " he be pleased to say , smile , " I expect , my dear , that you delicacy , and 's too , would be shocked on this preposterous occasion . I never see this play , rake as I be , but the impropriety of the epilogue send I away dissatisfie with it , and with human nature too : and you only see , by this one instance , what a character that of a actor or actress be , and how capable they be to personate any thing for a sorry subsistence . " " well , but , , " say I , " be there not , think you , extravagant scene and character enough in most play to justify the censure of the virtuous upon they , that the wicked
wicked friend of the author must cry the work in a epilogue , for fear the audience should go away improve by the representation ? it be not , I see , always narrowness of spirit , as I have hear some say , that open the mouth of good people against these diversion . " in this wild way talk I ; for I be quite out of patience at this unnatural and unexpected piece of ridicule , tacke to so serious a play , and come after such a moral . here be a specimen , my dear lady , of my observation on the first play I see . how just or how impertinent , I must leave to you better judgment . I very probably expose my ignorance and folly in they , but I will not say presumption , because you have put I upon the task , which otherwise I should hardly have attempt . I have very little reason therefore to blame myself on this score ; but , on the contrary , if I can escape you ladyship 's censure , have cause to pride myself in the opportunity you have thereby give I to show my readiness to obey you ; and the rather , since I be sure of you kindest indulgence , now you have give I leave to style myself _you ladyship 's obliged sister , and humble servant ,_ P.B. my , I give you in my last my bold remark upon a tragedy -_ the Distressed mother _. I will now give you my shallow notion of a comedy --_ the . I like this part of the title ; though I be not pleas with the other , explanatory of it ; -- the accomplished Fool . but when I hear it be write by , and that have give some hint towards it , if not some character -- " o , dear , " say I , " give we you company to this play ; for the author of the Spectator can not possibly produce a faulty scene . " indeed smile ; for I have not then read the play : and the of , he countess , , . and myself , agree to meet with a niece of my lord 's in the stage - box , which be take on purpose . there seem to I to be much wit and satire in the play : but , upon my word , I be grievously disappointed as to the morality of it ; nor , in some place , be -- _probability preserve ; and there be diver speech so very free , that I could not have expect to meet with such , from the name I mention . in short the author seem to have forget the moral all the way ; and be put in mind of it by some kind friend ( , perhaps ) , be at a loss to draw one from such character and plot as he have produce ; and so put down what come uppermost , for the sake of custom , without much regard to propriety . and truly , I should think , that the play be begin with a design to draw more amiable character , answerable to the title of the ; but that the author , be carry away by the luxuriancy of a genius , which he have not the heart to prune , on a general survey of the whole , distrust the propriety of that title , add the under one : with a or , the accomplished Fool , in justice to he piece , and compliment to he audience . have he call it the , I would not have be angry at he , because there would have be more propriety in the title . I wish I could , for the sake of the author , have praise every scene of this play : I hope to have reason for it . judge then , my dear lady , my mortification , not to be able to say I like above one , the 's scene , which too be out of time , be on the wedding - day ; and be force to disapprove of every character in it , and the view of every one . I be , dear madam , _you must oblige sister and servant , my dear Lady , although I can not tell how you receive my observation on the tragedy of the Distressed mother , and the comedy of the , yet will I proceed to give you ladyship my opinion of the opera I be at last night . but what can I say , after mention what you so well know , the fine scene , the genteel and splendid company , the charming voice , and delightful music ? if , Madam , one be all ear , and lose to every sense but that of harmony , surely the italian opera would be a transporting thing ! -- but when one find good sense , and instruction , and propriety , sacrifice to the charms of sound , what a unedifying , what a mere temporary delight do it afford ! for what do one carry home , but the remembrance of have be pleas so many hour by the mere vibration of air , which , be but sound , you can not bring away with you ; and must therefore enter the time pass in such a diversion , into the account of those blank hour , from which one have not reap so much as one improve lesson ? obserf , that when once sound be prefer to sense , we shall depart from all we own worthiness , and , at best , be but the ap , yea , the
the dupe , of those whom we may strive to imitate , but never can reach , much less . say , sometimes , that this taste be almost the only good fruit we young nobility gather , and bring home from they foreign tours ; and that he find the english nation much ridicule on this score , by those very people who be benefite by they depravity . and if this be the best , what must the other qualification be , which they bring home ?-- yet every one do not return with so little improvement , it be to be hope . but what can I say of a italian opera ?-- for who can describe sound ! or what word shall be find to embody air ? and when we return , and be ask we opinion of what we have see or hear , we be only able to answer , as I hint above the scenery be fine , the company splendid and genteel , the music charme for the time , the action not extraordinary , the language unintelligible , and , for all these reason -- the instruction none at all . this be all the thing itself give I room to say of the italian opera ; very probably , for want of a polite taste , and a knowledge of the language . in my next , I believe , I shall give you , madam , my opinion of a diversion , which , I doubt , I shall like still less , and that be a masquerade ; for I fear I shall not be excuse go to one , although I have no manner of liking to it , especially in my present way . I be . madam , _you ladyship 's most obliged and faithful_ P.B. I must add another half sheet to this letter on the subject matter of it , the opera ; and be sure you will not be displease with the addition . come up just as I have conclude my letter , ask I what be my subject ? I tell he I be give you ladyship my notion of the italian opera . " let I see what they be , my dear ; for this be a subject that very few of those who admire these performance , and fewer still of those who decry they , know any thing of . " he read the above , and be pleased to commend it . " operas , " say he , " be very sad thing in , to what they be in ; and the translation give of they abominable : and indeed , we language will not do they justice . " every nation , as you say , have its excellency ; and ours should not quit the manly nervous sense , which be the distinction of the english drama . one play of we celebrate Shakespeare will give infinitely more pleasure to a sensible mind than a dozen English - italian opera . but , my dear , in , they be quite another thing : and the sense be not , as here , sacrifice so much to the sound , but that they be both very compatible . " " be pleased , , to give I you observation on this head in writing , and then I shall have something to send worthy of 's acceptance . " " I will , my dear ; " and he take a pen , and write the inclose ; which I beg you ladyship to return I ; because I will keep it for my instruction , if I should be lead to talk of this subject in company . " let my sister know , " say he , " that I have give myself no time to re-peruse what I have write . she will do well , therefore , to correct it , and return it to you . " " in , judge of operas be so far from think the drama or poetical part of they opera nonsense , as the unskilled in italian rashly conclude in , that if the , as they call it , be not approve , the opera , notwithstand the excellence of the music , will be condemn . for the justly determine , that the very music of a opera can not be complete and pleasing , if the drama be incongruous , as I may call it , in its composition , because , in order to please , it must have the necessary contrast of the grave and the light , that be , the diverting equally blend through the whole . if there be too much of the first , let the music be compose ever so masterly in that style , it will become heavy and tiresome ; if the latter prevail , it will surfeit with its levity : wherefore it be the poet 's business to adapt the word for this agreeable mixture : for the music be but secondary , and subservient to the word ; and if there be a artful contrast in the drama , there will be the same in the music , suppose the composer to be a skilful master . " now , since in , the practice have be to mutilate , curtail , and patch up a drama in italian , in order to introduce favourite air , select from different author , the contrast have always be break thereby , without every one 's know the reason : and since ignorant mercenary prompter , though , have be employ in hotch - potch , and in translat we drama from into , how could such operas appear any other than incongruous nonsense ? " permit I , dear madam , to repeat my assurance ,
, that I be , and must ever be , _you oblige sister and servant , well , now , my dear lady , I will give you my poor opinion of a masquerade , to which persuade I to accompany ; for , as I hint in my former , I have a great indifference , or rather dislike , to go , and therefore want so powerful a second , to get I with she ; because I be afraid the freedom which I have hear be use there , would not be very agreeable to my apprehensive temper , at _this_ time especially . but find choose to have I go , if , as he be pleased to say , I have no objection , " I say , I _will have none , I _can_ have none , when you tell I it be you choice ; and so send for the habit you like , and that you would have I appear in , and I will cheerfully attend you . " the habit pitch upon be that of a spanish , and it well befit the majesty of he person and air ; and choose that of a young Widow ; and recommend that of a Quaker for I . we all admire one another in we dress ; and promise to have I always in he eye , we go thither . but I never desire to be present at another . be single out by a bold , who talk italian to he with such free air , that I do not much like it , though I know not what she say ; for I think the dear gentleman no more keep to he spanish gravity , than she to the requisite of the habit she wear : when I have imagine that all that be tolerable in a masquerade , be the acting up to the character each person assume : and this give I no objection to the Quaker 's dress ; for I think I be prim enough for that naturally . I say softly , " dear " ( for and the be out of sight in a moment ) , " what be become of that nun ? " --" , " whisper she , " what be become of the ? " a attack I instantly in ; but I answer in , not know what he say , " Quaker be not fit company for Red-hat . " " they be , " say he , in the same language ; " for a and a Jesuit be the same thing . " be address by the name of the : another ask , how long she intend to wear those weed ? and a footman , in a rich livery , answer for she eye , through she mask , that it would not be a month . but I be start when a Presbyterian Parson come up , and bid I look after my -- so that I doubt not by this , it must be one who know my name to be ; and I soon think of one of my lawyer , whose character I give before . indeed , he need not to bid I ; for I be sorry , on more account than that of my timorousness , to have lose sight of he . " out upon these nasty masquerade ! " think I ; " I can not abide they already ! " a egregious beauish appearance come up to , and say , " you hang out a very pretty _sign , . " " not , " reply she , " to invite such fop as you to my shop . " " any customer would be welcome , " return he , " in my opinion . I whisper this as a secret . " " and I whisper another , " say she , but not whisperingly , " that no place warrant ill manners . " " be you angry , ? " she affec a laugh : " no , indeed , it I ' not worth while . " he turn to I -- and I be afraid of some such hit as he give I . " I hope , friend , thou be prepare with a father for the light within thee ? " " be this wit ? " say I , turn to : " I have enough of this diversion , where nothing but coarse jest appear _barefac ' _. " at last accost we , as if he have not know we . " so lovly a widow , and so sweet a friend ! no wonder you do not separate : for I see not in this various assembly a third person of you sex fit to join with you . " " not _one , ! " say I . " will not a penitent make a good third with a mournful Widow , and a prim Quaker ? " " not for more than ten minute at most . " instantly the , a fine person of a lady , with a noble air , though I do not like she , join we , and speak in italian something very free , as it see by she manner , and . smile answer ; but neither nor I understand that language , and . would not explain it to we . but she give he a signal to follow she , seem to be much take with he person and air ; for though there be three other spanish habit there , he be call the by one , the handsome by another , in we hearing , as he pass with we to the dessert , where we drank each of we a glass of , and
and eat a few sweetmeat , with a crowd about we ; but we appear not to know one another : while several odd appearance , as one , one chinese , several 's , of both sex , a , a jewish , a , a , a Turkish Bashaw , and , glide by we , as we return into company , signify that we be stranger to they by squeak out --" _I know you !_" -- which be half the wit of the place . two lady , one in a very fantastic party - coloured habit , with a plume of feather , the other in a rustic one , with a garland of flower round she head , be much take notice of for they freedom , and have something to say to every body . they be as seldom separate as and I , and be follow by a crowd wherever they go . the party - colou one come up to I : " , " say she , " there be something in thy person that attract every one 's notice : but if a sack have not be a profane thing , it would have become thee almost as well . " --" I thank thee , friend , " say I , " for thy counsel ; but if thou hadst be pleased to look at home , thou wouldst not have take so much pain to join such advice , and such a appearance , together , as thou makest ! " this make every one that hear it laugh .-- one say , the butterfly hath meet with she match . she return , with a affect laugh , " Smartly say ! --But art thou come hither , friend , to make thy light shine before man or woman ? " " Verily , friend , neither , " reply I : " but out of mere curiosity , to look into the _mind of both sex ; which I read in they _dress _. " " a general satire on the assemblee , by the mass !

" answer she in Italian ( I wish I understand italian ! ) -- and she have recourse to she bead . you can not imagine , madam , how this nun haunt he !-- I do not like these masquerade at all . many lady , on these occasion , be so very free , that the censorious will be apt to blame the whole sex for _their_ conduct , and to say , they heart be as faulty as those of the most culpable man , since they scruple not to show as much , when they think they can not be know by they face . but it be my humble opinion , that could a standard be fix , by which one could determine readily what _i , and what be _not_ wit , decency would not be so often woun by attempt to be witty , as it be . for here every one , who can say thing that shock a modester person , not meet with due rebuke , but perhaps a smile , ( without consider whether it be of contempt or approbation ) mistake courage for wit ; and every thing sacr or civil become the subject of he frothy jest . but what a moralizer be I ! will you ladyship say : indeed I can not help it :-- and especially on such a subject as a _masquerade , which I dislike more than any thing I ever see . I could say a great deal more on this occasion ; but , upon my word , I be quite out of humour with it : for I like my better than my : and the I approve not by any means ; though there be some who observe , that she be one of the gracefullest figure in the place . and , indeed , in spite of my own heart , I could not help think so too . you ladyship know so well what _masquerade be , that I may well be excuse say any thing further on a subject I be so little pleased with : for you only desire my notion
notion of those diversion , because I be a novice in they ; and this , I doubt not , will doubly serve to answer that purpose . I shall only therefore add , that after a hundred other impertinence speak to and I , and retort with spirit by she , and as well as I could by myself , quite sick of the place , I feign to be more indisposed than I be , and so get my beloved Spaniard to go off with we , and reach home by three in the morning . and so much for _masquerade . I hope I shall never have occasion to mention they again to you ladyship . I be , my dearest madam , _you ever oblige sister and servant , my , my mind be so wholly engross by thought of a very different nature from those which the diversion of the town and theatre inspire , that I beg to be excuse , if , for the present , I say nothing further of those lighter matters . but as you do not disapprove of my remark , I intend , if spare my life , to make a little book , which I will present to you ladyship , of my poor observation on all the dramatic entertainment I have see , and shall see , this winter : and for this purpose I have make brief note in the margin of the print play I have buy , as I see they , with a pencil ; by refer to which , as help to my memory , I shall be able to state what my thought be at the time of see they pretty nearly with the same advantage , as if I have write they at my return from each . I have obtain , and 's permission for to stay with I till it shall be see how it will please to deal with I , and I owe this favour partly to a kind letter write in my behalf to , by , and partly to the young lady 's earnest request to she papa , to oblige I ; have make some difficulty to comply , as and he bride have leave they , say , he could not live long , if he have not the company of he beloved daughter . but what shall I say , when I find my frailty so much increase , that I cannot , with the same intenseness of devotion I use to be blest with , apply myself to the throne of , nor , of consequence , find my invocation answer by that delight and inward satisfaction , with which I use when the present near prospect be more remote ? I hope I shall not be desert in the hour of trial , and that this my weakness of mind will not be punish with a spiritual dereliction , for suffer myself to be too much attach to those worldly delight and pleasure , which no mortal ever enjoy in a more exalted degree than myself . and I beseech you , my dearest lady , let I be always remember in you prayer -- _only for a resignation to the divine will ; a _cheerful resignation ! I presume not to prescribe to he gracious Providence ; for if one have but _that , one have every thing that one need to have . forgive I , my dearest lady , for be so deeply serious . I have just be contend with a severe pang , that be now go off ; what effect it be return may have , only know . and if this be the last line I shall ever write , it will be the more satisfactory to I , as ( with my humble respects to my good , and my dear countess , and pray for the continuance of all you healt and happiness , both here and hereafter ) , I be permit to subscribe myself _you ladyship 's obliged sister and humble servant , from to ._ my Dearest brother , Although I believe it needless to put a man of you generous spirit in mind of do a worthy action ; yet , as I do not know whether you have think of what I be go to hint to you , I can not forbear a line or two with regard to the good old couple in . I be sure , if , for we sins , should take from we my incomparable sister ( forgive I , my dear brother , but to intimate what _may be , although I hourly pray , as she try minute approach , that it will not ) , you will , for she sake , take care that she honest parent have not the loss of you favour , to deepen the inconsolable one , they will have , in such a case , of the best of daughter . I say , I be sure you will do as generously by they as ever : and I dare say you sweet Pamela doubt it not : yet , as you know how sensible she be of every favour do they , it be the countess 's opinion and mine , and 's too , that you give _her_ this assurance , in some _legal_ way : for , as she be naturally apprehensive , and think more of she present circumstance , than , for you sake , she choose to express to you , it will be like a cordial to she dutiful and grateful heart ; and I do not know , if it will not contribute , more than any _one_ thing , to make she go through she task with ease and safety . I know how much you heart be wrap up
up in the dear creature : and you be a worthy brother to let it be so ! you will excuse I therefore , I be sure , for this my officiousness . I have no doubt but will spare she to we , because , although we may not be worthy of such excellence , yet we all now unite so gratefully to thank he , for such a worthy relation , that I hope we shall not be deprive of a example so necessary to we all . I can have but one fear , and that be , that , young as she be , she seem ripen for glory : she seem to have liv long enough for _herself . but for you , and for _us , that will _still_ spare she , shall be the hourly prayer of , _my dear worthy brother , you ever affectionate sister , benefit . Daver . have you get she mother with you ? I hope you have . give you a son and heir , if it be he bless will ! but , however that be , preserve you to you ! for you never can have such _another wife . from to ._ my dear and ever - HONOURED , since I know not how it may please to dispose of I on the approaching occasion , I should think myself inexcusable , not to find one or two select hour to dedicate to you , out of the very many , in the write way , which you goodness have indulge I , because you see I take delight in it . but yet , think not , of best beloved of my heart ! that I have any boon to beg , any favour to ask , either for myself or for my friend , or so much as the _continuance_ of you favour , to the one or the other . as to they , you have prevent and exceed all my wish : as to myself , if it please to spare I , I know I shall always be reward beyond my desert , let my deserving be what they will . I have only therefore to acknowledge with the deepest sense of you goodness to I , and with the most heart-affecting gratitude , that from the happy , the thrice happy hour , that you so generously make I yours , till _this moment , you have not leave one thing , on my own part , to wish for , but the continuance and increase of you felicity , and that I might be still worthier of the unexampled goodness , tenderness , and condescension , wherewith you have always treat I . no , my dearest , my best beloved master , friend , husband , my _first , my _last , and _only love ! believe I , I have nothing to wish for but you honour and felicity , temporal and eternal ; and I make no doubt , that , in he infinite goodness and mercy , will perfect he own good work , begin in you dear heart ; and , whatever may now happen , give we a happy meeting , never more to part from one another . let I then beg of you , my dearest protector , to pardon all my imperfection and defect ; and if , ever since I have have the honour to be yours , I have in _look , or in _word , or in _deed , give you cause to wish I other than I be , that you will kindly put it to the score of natural infirmity ( for in _thotch or _intention , I can truly boast , I have never wilfully er ) . you tenderness , and generous politeness to I , always give I apprehension , that I be not what you wish I to be , because you would not find fault with I so often as I fear I deserv : and this make I beg of you to do , as I hope will , pardon all my involuntary error and omission . but let I say one word for my dear worthy . she care and fidelity will be very necessary for you affair , dear , while you remain single , which I hope will not be long . but , whenever you make a second choice , be pleased to allow she such a annuity as may make she independent , and pass away the remainder of she life with ease and comfort . and this I the rather presume to request , as my late honoured lady once intimate the same thing to you . if I be to name what that may be , it would not be with the thought of _heighten , but of _limiting_ rather , the natural bounty of you heart ; and fifty pound a - year would be a rich provision , in she opinion , and will entail upon you , dear , the blessing of one of the faithfullest and worthiest heart in the kingdom . will charity permit I to forget the once wicked , but now penitent Jewkes . I understand by , that she beg for nothing but to have the pleasure of dying in you service , and by that mean to ato for some small slips and mistakes in she account , which she have make formerly , and she accuse herself ; for she will have it , that have be better to she than she deserve , in passing one account particularly , to which he have , with too much reason , object ; do , dear Sir , if you _future_ happy lady have no great dislike to the poor woman , be pleased to grant she request , except she
she own mind should alter , and she desire she dismission . and now I have to beg of to shower down he most precious blessing upon you , my dearest , my _first , my _last , and my _only love ! and to return to you a hundr fold , the benefit which you have confer upon I and mine , and upon so many poor soul , as you have bless through my hand ! and that you may in you next choice be happy with a lady , who may have every thing I want ; and who may love and honour you , with the same affectionate duty , which have be my delight and my glory to pay you : for in this I be sure , no one _can_ exceed I !-- and after have give you long life , prosperity , and increase of honour , translate you into a bless eternity , where , through the merit of we common Redeemer , I hope I shall be allow a place , and be permit ( o let I indulge that pleasing , that _consolatory think ! ) to receive and rejoice in my restored spouse , for ever and ever : be the prayer , the _last_ prayer , if it so please ! of , my dearest dear , _your dutiful and affectionate wife , and faithful servant , from to ._ my HONOURED , you can not conceive how you and my dear papa have delighte my good and oblige she by the permission you have give I to attend she till the important hour shall be over with she ; for she be exceedingly apprehensive , and one can hardly blame she ; since there be hardly such another happy couple in the world . I be glad to hear that the ceremony be over , so much to both you satisfaction : may this matrimony be but a _tenth part_ as happy as that I be witness to here ; and and will have that to boast of , which few married people have , even among those we call happy ! for my part , I believe I shall never care to marry at all ; for though I can not be so deserve as . B . yet I shall not bear to think of a husband much less excellent than hers . Nay , by what I see in _her_ apprehension , and conceive of the condition she hourly expect to be in , I do not think a lady can be requit with a _less worthy one , for all she be likely to suffer on a husband 's account , and for the sake of _his_ family and name . , a discreet worthy soul as ever I know , and who in she aspect and behaviour be far from be a disgrace even to . lady , be with she dear daughter , to she no small satisfaction , as you may suppose . ask my advice yesterday , about have in the house a midwife , to be at hand , at a moment 's warning . I say I fear the sight of such a person would terrify she : and so he instantly start a expedient , of which she mother , , and myself , approve , and have put into practice ; for this day , , a distant relation of _mine , though not of yours , and , be arrive from to make I a visit ; and . have prevail upon she , in _compliment to I _, as he pretend , to accept of she board in he house , while she stay in town , which she say , will be about a week . be a discreet , modest , matron - like person , . . take a liking to she at first sight , and be already very familiar with she ; and understand that she be a doctor of physic 's lady , and take as much delight in administer to the health of she own sex , as she husband use to do to that of both , . say it be very fortunate , that she have so experience a lady to consult , as she be such a novice in she own case . however , to carry on the honest imposture the better , just now , in presence of , and , and I , ask the former , if it be not necessary to have in the house the good woman ? this frighted . who turn pale , and say she could not bear the thought of it . say it be highly necessary that . if she would not permit the gentlewoman to be in the house , should see she ; and that then , she apprehend , there would be no necessity , as she do not live far off , to have she in the house , since . be so uneasy upon that account . this pleased much , and be admit to attend she . now , you must know , that this be the assistant of my new relation ; and she be apprise of the matter , come ; but never do I see so much shyness and apprehension as shew all the time be with she , hold sometimes she mother , sometimes , by the hand , and be ready to sweat with terror . scrape acquaintance with , who , pretend to recollect she , give great praise ; which increase . . confidence in she : and she undertake to govern the whole so , that the dread need not come till the very moment : which be no small pleasure to the over -nice lady . and she seem every hour to be better pleased with , who
who , by she prudent talk , will more and more familiarize she to the circumstance , unawar to herself in a manner . but notwithstand this precaution , of a midwife in the house , intend to have a gentleman of the profession in readiness , for fear of the worst . . have write a letter , with this superscription : " to the ever - honoured and ever - dear , with prayer for he health , honour , and prosperity in this world , and everlast felicity in that to come . P.B. " it be seal with black wax , and she give it I this moment , on she be take ill , to give to if she die . but , of he mercy , avert that ! and preserve the dear lady , for the honour of she sex , and the happiness of all who know she , and particularly for that of you ; for I can not have a greater loss , I be sure , while my honoured papa and mamma be live : and may that be for many , very many , happy year ! I will not close this letter till all be over : happily , as I hope !-- be better again , and have , occasionally , make some fine reflection , direct herself to I , but design for the benefit of she , on the subject of the inconsideration of some of we sex , with regard to the circumstance she be in . I know what she design be , and say , " aye , Polly , let you and I , and every single young body , bear these reflection in mind , pronounce by so excellent a lady , in a moment so arduous as these ! " the girl wept , and very movingly fall down by the door , on she knee , pray to to preserve she dear lady , and she should be happy for ever ! be exceedingly pleased with my new relation , as we call she , who behave with so much prudence , that she suspect nothing , and tell , she wish nobody else be to come near she . and as she go out ( be a person of eminence in she way ) two or three time a day , and last night stay out late , . say , she hope she would not be abroad , when she should wish she to be at home -- I have the very great pleasure , my dear papa and mamma , to acquaint you , and I know you will rejoice with I upon it , that just half a hour ago , my dear be bring to - bed of a fine boy . we be all out of we wit for joy almost . I run down to myself , who receive I with trembling impatience . " a boy ! a fine boy ! dear , " say I : " a son and here , indeed ! " " but how do my ? be _she safe ? be _she_ like to do well ? " --" we hope so , " say I : " or I have not come down to you , I will assure you .

" be so overjoyed , and so thankful , that there be no get she from she knee . a man and horse be dispatche already to , and another order to , to the good old man . , when I go up , say she must go down and release the good folk from they knee ; for , half a hour before , they declare they would not stir from that posture till they hear how it go with they lady ; and when the happy news be bring they of she safety , and of a young master , they be quite ecstatic , she say , in they joy , and not a dry eye among they , shak hand , and congratulate one another , man and maid ; which make it one of the most affecting sight that can be imagine . and , who have no power to leave the house for three day past , hast to congratulate he worthy principal ; and never be so much move joy seen , as this honest - hear steward run over with . I do a foolish thing in my joy -- I give . the letter design for he , have a unhappy event follow ; and he will not return it : but say , he will obtain . benefit .' leave , when she be better , to open it ; and the happier turn will augment he thankfulness to , and love to she , when he shall , by this mean , be blest with sentiment so different from what the other case would have afforde . . have a very sharp time . never more , my dear papa , talk of a husband to I . place all you expectation on ! not one of these man that I have yet see , be worth run these risque for ! but .' endearment and tenderness to he lady , he thankful and manly gratitude and politeness , when he be admit to pay he respects to she , and he behaviour to , and to we all , though but for a visit of ten minute , be alone worthy of all she risque . I would give you a
a description of it , have I Mrs . b .' pen , and of twenty agreeable scene and conversation besides : but , for want of that , must conclude , with my humble duty , as become , honoure , and , _your ever grateful_ Polly Darnford . from the same ._ my Honoured and , we have nothing but joy and festivity in this house : and it would be endless to tell you the congratulation the happy family receive every day , from tenant and friend . , you know , be always deem one of the kindest landlord in ; and he tenant be overjoy at the happy event which have give they a young landlord of he name : for all those who live in that large part of the estate , which come by . . he mother , be much afraid of have any of 's family for they landlord , who , they say , be all make up of pride and cruelty , and would have rack they to death : insomuch that they have a voluntary meeting of about twenty of the principal of they , to rejoice on the occasion ; and it be unanimously agree to make a present of a piece of gilt plate , to serve as basin for the christening , to the value of one hundred guinea ; on which be to be engrave the follow inscription : " in acknowledgment of the humanity and generosity of the best of landlord , and as a token of he tenant 's joy on the birth of a son and heir , who will , it be hope , inherin he father 's generosity , and he mother 's virtue , this piece of plate be , with all due gratitude , present , as a christen basin to all the child that shall proceed from such worthy parent , and they descendant , to the end of time ._ " by the obliged and joyful tenant of the maternal estate in and , the initial of whose name be under engraven , viz. " then be to follow the first letter of each person 's and surname . what a honou be this to a landlord ! in my opinion very far surpass the _mis-nomer have free gift which we read of in some kingdom on extraordinary occasion , some of they like this ! for here it be all truly spontaneous -- a free gift _indeed _! and . take it very kindly , and have put off the christening for a week , to give time for it be be complete and inscribe as above . the and of and and , be here , to stand in person at the christening ; and you can not conceive how greatly my be transport with joy , to have a son and here to the estate : she be every hour , almost , thanke she dear sister for he ; and read in the child all the great quality she form to herself in he . ' Tis indeed a charming boy , and have a great deal ( if one may judge of a child so very young ) of he father 's manly aspect . the dear lady herself be still but weak ; but the joy of all around she , and she spouse 's tenderness and politeness , give she cheerful and free spirit ; and she be all serenity , ease , and thankfulness . , as soon as the danger be over , ask I for she letter with the black seal . I have be very earnest to get it from but to no purpose ; so I be force to tell who have it . she say , but very composedly , she be sorry for it , and hope he have not open it . he come into she chamber soon after , and I demand it before she . he say he have design to ask she leave to break the seal , which he have not yet do ; nor would without she consent . " will you give I leave , my dear , " say he , " to break the seal ? " --" if you do , , let it not be in my presence ; but it be too serious . " -- " not , my dear , now the apprehension be so happily over : it may now add to my joy and my thankfulness on that account . " --" then , do as you please , ; but I have rather you would not . " " then here it be , : it be put into you hand , and there I place it again . " --" that be something like , " say I , " consider the gentleman . , I hope we shall bring he into good order between we in time . " so I return it to the dear writer ; who put it into she bosom . I relate to , when she come , this circumstance ; and she , I believe , have leave to take it with she . she be very proud of all opportunity now of justify she brother 's choice , and do honou to he wife , with , who be she great favourite , and who delight to read . . 's letter . you desire to know , my honoured papa , how pass he time , and whether it be in he lady 's chamber ? no , indeed ! catch gentleman , the best of they , in too great a complaisance that way , if you can . " what then , do he pass he time _with you , Polly ? " you be pleased to ask . what a disadvantage a
a man lie under , who have be once a rake ! but I be so generally with . . that when I tell you , , he visit to she be much of the polite form , I believe I answer all you mean by you question ; and especially when I remind you , , that and , and the Earl and Countess of and you unworthy daughter , be at dinner and supper - time generally together ; for , who be not yet go back to , breakfast , dine , and sup with she beloved daughter , and be hardly ever out of she room . then , , , the , and , give pretty constant attendance to the business of parliament ; and , now and - then , sup abroad -- so , , we be all upon honour ; and I could wish ( only that you facetiousness always give I pleasure , as it be a token that you have you much - desired health and freedom of spirit ) , that even in , my mamma 's daughter might pass unquestioned . but I know _why you do it : it be only to put I out of heart to ask to stay longer . yet I wish -- but I know you will not permit I to go through the whole winter here . will my dear papa grant it , do you think , if you be to lay the highest obligation upon you dutiful daughter , and petition for I ? and should you care to try ? I dare not hope it myself : but when one see a gentleman here , who deny he lady nothing , it make one wish , methink , that , be as happy in that particular as . you indulgence for this _one_ winter , or , rather this small _remainder of it , I make not so much doubt of , you see , . I know you will call I a bold girl ; but then you always , when you do , condescmend to grant my request : and I will be as good as ever I can be afterwards . I will fetch up all the lost time ; rise a hour sooner in the morning , go to be a hour later at night ; flower my papa any thing he please ; read he to sleep when he please ; put he gout into good - humour , when it will be soothe -- and , to cry all , will come down with I , by permission of she sovereign lord , who will attend she , you may be sure : and will not _all_ this do , to procure I a month or two more ?-- if it will not , why then , I will thank you for you past goodness to I , and with all duty and cheerfulness , bid adieu to this dear , this dearer family , and tend a _still_ dearer papa and mamma ; whose dutiful daughter I will ever be , whilst POLLy Darnford . to the same ._ my Honoured and , I have receive you jous not command , and intend to set out on , next week . I hope to find my papa in better health than at present , and in better humour too ; for I be sorry he be displease with my petitioning for a little longer time in . it be very severe to impute to I want of duty and affection , which would , if deserve , make I most unworthy of you favour . and he lady be resolve to accompany I in they coach , till you chariot meet I , if you will be pleased to permit it so to do ; and even set I down at you gate , if it do not ; but he vow , that he will neither alight at you house , nor let he lady . but I say , that this be a misplaced resentment , because I ought to think it a favour , that you have indulge I so much as you have do . and yet even this be likewise a favour on _their_ side , to I , because it be a instance of they fondness for you unworthy daughter 's company . be , if possible , more lovely since she lie - in than before . she have so much delight in she nursery , that I fear it will take she off from she pen , which will be a great loss to all whom she use to oblige with she correspondence . indeed this new object of she care be a charming child ; and she be exceedingly pleased with she nurse ; -- for she be not permit , as she very much desire , to suckle it herself . she make a great proficiency in the french and italian language ; and well she may ; for she have the best schoolmaster in the world , and one whom she love better than any lady ever love a tutor . he be lofy , and will not be dispute with ; but I never see a more polite and tender husband , for all that . we have a splendid christening , exceedingly well order , and every body be delighte at it . the quality gossip go away but on ; and my take leave of she charming sister with all the blessing , and all the kindness , and affectionate fondness , that could be express . , that worthy old man , come up to see he grandson , yesterday . you would never have forget the good man 's behaviour ( have you see it ) , to he daughter , and to the charme child
child ; I wish I could describe it to you ; but I be apt to think . . will notice it to ; and if she enter into the description of it while I stay , I will beg a copy of it , to bring down with I ; because I know you be pleased with the sensible , plain , good man , and he way , when at the hall in you neighbourhood . the child be name , and I should have tell you ; but I write without any manner of connection , just as thing come uppermost : but do not , my dear papa , construe this , too , as a instance of disrespect . I see but one thing that can possibly happen to disturb the felicity of this charme couple ; and that I will mention , in confidence . and . . and myself be at the masquerade , before she lay - in : there be a lady greatly take with . she be in a nun 's habit , and follow he wherever he go ; and , a gentleman of one of the inns of court , who visit . and be a old acquaintance of he , tell I , by - the bye , that the lady take a opportunity to unmask to . have since find she be the young Countess Dowager of ----, a fine lady ; but not the most reserve in she conduct of late , since she widowhood . and he have since discover , as he say , that a letter or two , if not more , have pass between . and that lady . now , with all her perfection , have , as she _own , a little spice of jealousy ; and should she be once alarmed , I tremble for the consequence to both they happiness . I conceive , that if ever anything make a misunderstanding between they , it will be from some such quarter as this . but ' ti a thousand pity it should . and I hope , as to the actual correspondence begin , be mistaken . but be it as it will , I would not for the world , that the first hint of this matter should come from I .-- be a very enterprising and gallant man , a fine figure , and I do not wonder a lady may like he . but he seem so pleased , so satisfied with he wife , and carry it to she with so much tenderness and affection , that I hope she merit , and he affection for she , will secure he conjugal fidelity . if it prove otherwise , and she discover it , I know not one that would be more miserable than , as well from motives of piety and virtue , as from the excessive love she bear he . but I hope for better thing , for both they sake . my humble thanks for all you indulgence to I , with hope , that you will not , my dear papa and mamma , hold you displeasure against I , when I throw myself at you foot , as I now soon hope to do . conclude I _your dutiful daughter , . from to . my , we be just return from accompany the worthy as far as , in she way home , where she papa and mamma meet she in they coach . put on he pleasant air , and school for persuade he daughter to stay so long from he ; _me_ for put she upon ask to stay longer ; and _she for be persuade by we . we tarry two day together at ; for we know not how to part ; and then we take a most affectionate leave of each other . we strike out of the road a little , to make a visit to the dear house , where we tarry one night ; and next morning before any body could come to congratulate we ( design to be _incog_. ) , we proceed on we journey to , and find my dearest , dear boy , in charming health . what a new pleasure have bestow upon I ; which , after every little absence , rise upon I in a true maternal tenderness , every step I move toward the dear little blessing ! yet sometimes , I think you dear brother be not so fond of he as I wish he to be . he say , " ' ttis time enough for he to mind he , when he can return he notice , and be grateful ! " -- a negligent word be not it , Madam -- consider -- my dear father come to town , to accompany my good mother down to , and they set out soon after you ladyship leave we . it be impossible to describe the joy with which he worthy heart overflow , when he congratulate we on the happy event . and as he have be apprehensive for he daughter 's safety , judge , my lady , what he transport must be , to see we all safe and well , and happy , and a son give to by he greatly honoure daughter . I be in the nursery when he come . so be my mother . also be there . and , who be in he closet , at he arrival , after have receive he most respectful congratulation himself , bring he up ( though he have not be there since : indeed he ha' not ! ) " , " say the dear gentleman , " see who be here ! " I spring to he , and knee for he blessing : " of my father ! "
" say I , " see " ( point to the dear baby at the nurse 's breast ) , " how have answer all we prayer ! " he drop down on he knee by I , clasp I in he indulgent arm : " of my daughter !-- my bless daughter !-- and do I once more see you ! and see you safe and well !-- I do ! I do !-- blessed be thy name , of gracious God , for these thy mercy ! " while we be thus joined , happy father , and happy daughter , in one thanksgive , the sweet baby have fall asleep , the nurse have put it into the cradle ; and when my father rise from I , he go to my mother , " bless my dear , " say he , " I longe to see you , after this separation . here be joy ! here be pleasure ! of how happy be we ! " and take she hand , he knee down on one side the cradle , and my mother on the other , both look at the dear baby , with eye run over ; and , hand in hand , he pray , in the most fervent manner , for a blessing upon the dear infant , and that would make he a honour to he father 's family , and to he mother 's virtue ; and that , in the word of Scripture , " he might grow on , and be in favour both with the , and with man . " have just put into my hand 's Treatise on education , and he command I to give he my thought upon it in writing . he have a very high regard for this author , and tell I , that my tenderness for will make I think some of the first advice give in it a little harsh ; but although he have not read it through , only have dip into it here and there , he believe from the name of the author , I can not have a better directory ; and my opinion of it , after I have well consider it , will inform he , he say , of my own capacity and prudence , and how far he may rely upon both in the point of a _first education _. I ask , if I might not be excuse writing , only make my observation , here and there , to himself , as I find occasion ? but he say , " you will yourself , my dear , better consider the subject , and be more a mistress of it , and I shall the better attend to you reasoning , when put into write : and surly , , you may , in such a important point as this , as well oblige _me_ with a little of you penmanship , as you other dear friend . " after this , you ladyship will judge I have not another word to say . he cut one to the heart , when he speak so seriously . I have look a little into it . it be a book quite accommodate to my case , be write to a gentleman , the author 's friend , for the regulation of he conduct towards he child . but how shall I do , if in such a fam and renowne author , I see already some few thing , which I think want clear up . will not it look like intolerable vanity in I , to find fault with such a genius as ? I must , on this occasion , give you ladyship the particular of a short conversation between you brother and I ; which , however , perhaps , will not be to my advantage , because it will show you what a teazing body I can be , if I be indulge . but will not spoil I neither in that way , I dare say ! -- you ladyship will see this in the very dialogue I shall give you . thus it be . I have be read in 's book , and ask I how I like it ?--" Exceedingly well , . but I have a proposal to make , which , if you will be pleased to comply with , will give I a charming opportunity of understanding . " " what be you proposal , my dear ? I see it be some very particular one , by that sweet earnestness in you look . " " why , so it be , : and I must know , whether you be in high good humour , before I make it . I think you look grave upon I ; and my proposal will not then do , I be sure . " " you have all the amusing way of you sex , my dear . but tell I what you would say ? you know I do not love suspense . " " - be you be busy . . perhaps I break in upon you . I believe you be go into you closet . " " true woman !-- how you love to put one upon the tenter ! yet , my life for yours , by you parade , what I just now think important , be some pretty trifle ! -- speak it at once , or I will be angry with you ; " and tap my cheek . " well , I wish I have not come just now !-- I see you be not in a good humour enough for my proposal , pray , , excuse I till to - morrow . " he take my hand , and lead I to he closet , call
call I he pretty impertinent ; and then urge I , I say , " you know , , I have not be use to the company of child . you dear will not make I fit , for a long time , to judge of any part of education . I can learn of the charming boy nothing but the baby conduct : but now , if I might take into the house some little master of three or four year old , or of five or six , I should watch over all they little way ; and now read a chapter in the _child , and now one in the _book_ , I can look forward , and with advantage , into the subject ; and go through all the part of education tolerably , for one of my capacity ; for , , I can , by my own defect , and what I have wish to mmend , know how to judge of , and supply that part of life which carry a child up to eleven or twelve year of age , which be mine , when my lady take I . " " a pretty thought , ! but tell I , who will part with they child , think you ? would _you _, if it be you case , although ever so well assure of the advantages you little one would reap by it ?-- for do not you consider , that the child ink to be wholly subject to you authority ? that it be father or mother ought seldom to see it ; because it should think itself absolutely dependent upon you ?--And where , my dear , will you meet with parent so resign ? -- , one would have the child descende of genteel parent , and not such as could do nothing for it ; otherwise the turn of mind and education you would give it , might do it more harm than good . " " all this , , be very true . but have you no other objection , if one could find a genteely - descende young master ? and would you join to persuade he papa to give I up he power , only from three month to three month , as I like , and the child like , and as the approve of my proceedings ? " " this be so reasonable , with these last condition , , that I should be pleased with you notion , if it could be put in practice , because the child would be benefite by you instruction , and you would be improve in a art , which I could wish to see you a adept in . " " but , perhaps . , you have rather it be a girl than a boy ? " --" I have , my dear , if a girl could be find , whose parent would give she up to you ; but I suppose you have some boy in you head , by you put it upon that sex at first . " " let I see , , you say you be in a good humour ! let I see if you be ; " -- look boldly in he face . " what now , " with some little impatience , " would the pretty fool be at ? " " only , , that you have nothing to do , but to speak the word , and there be a child , whose papa and mamma too , I be sure , would consent to give up to I for my own instruction , as well as for she sake ; and if , to speak in the Scripture phrase , I have find _grace in you sight , kind , speak this word to the dear child 's papa . " " and have you thus come over I , !-- , I be half angry with you , for lead I on in this manner against myself . this look so artful , that I will not love you ! " --" dear sir ! " -- " and dear Madam too ! be gone , I say !-- you have surprise I by art , when you talent be nature , and you should keep to that ! " I be sadly baulk , and have neither power to go nor stay ! at last , see I have put he into a kind of flutter , as now he have put I , I move my unwilling foot towards the door .-- he take a turn about the closet meantime .--" yet stay , " say he , " there be something so generous in you art , that , on recollection , I can not part with you . " he take notice of the starting tear -- " I be to blame ! -- you have surprise I so , that my hasty temper get the better of my consideration . let I kiss away this pearly fugitive . forgive I , my dearest love ! what a inconsiderate brute be I , when compare to such a angel as my ! I see at once now , all the force , and all the merit , of you amiable generosity : and to make you amend for this my hastiness , I will coolly consider of the matter , and will either satisfy you by my compliance , or by the reason , which I will give you for the contrary . " but , say , my , can you forgive my harshness ? " --" can I !-- yes , indeed , , " press he hand to my lip ; " and bid I , and be gone , twenty time a - day , if I be to be
be thus kindly call back to you , thus nobly and condescendingly treat , in the same breath !- I see , dear , " continue I , " that I must be in fault , if ever you be lastingly displease with I . for as soon as you turn yourself about , you anger vanish , and you make I rich amend for a few harsh word . only one thing , dear Sir , let I add ; if I have deal artfully with you , impute it to my fear of offend you , through the nature of my petition , and not to design ; and that I take the example of the prophet , to , in the parable of the _Ewe - lamb._ " " I remember it , my dear -- and you have well point you parable , and have nothing to do , but to say -- '_ thou be the man ! '_ " I be call upon by my dear benefactor for a little airing , and he suffer I only to conclude this long letter . so I be oblige , with greater abruptness than I have design , to mention thankfully you ladyship 's goodness to I ; particularly in that kind , kind letter , in behalf of my dear parent , have a certain event take place . shew it to I _this morning , and not before -- I believe , for fear I should have be so much oppress by the sense of you unmerited goodness to I , have he let I know of it before you departure from we , that I should not have be able to look up at you ; heap favour and blessing upon I , as you be hourly do besides . what a happy creature be I !-- but my gratitude run I into length ; and sorry I be , that I can not have time just now to indulge it . be there nothing , my dear and , my dear Lady Countess , and my good , that I can do , to show at least , that I have a _will , and be not a ungrateful , sordid creature ? and yet , if you give I power to do any thing that will have the _appearance of a return , even that _power will be lay a fresh obligation upon I -- which , however , I should be very proud of , because I should thereby convince you , by more than word , how much I be ( most particularly , my dearest , my sister , my friend , my patroness ) , _you most obliged and faithful servant ,_ P.b. you dear brother join in respectful thankfulness to he four noble gossip . and my , by he lip , subscribe he . I hope so to direct he earliest notion , as to make he sensible of he dutiful obligation . from to ._ my , talk not to we of unreturnable obligation and all that . you do more for we , in the entertainment you give we all , by you letter , than we _have_ do , or even _can_ do , for you . and as to I , I know no greater pleasure in the world than that which my brother 's felicity and yours give I . God continue this felicity to you both . I be sure it will be _his_ fault , and not yours , if it be at all diminish . we have hear some idle rumour here , as if you be a little uneasy of late ; and have not have a letter from you for this fortnight past , it make I write , to ask you how you all do ? and whether you expect a answer from I to you last ? I hope you will not be punctilious with I . for we have nothing to write about , except it be how much we all love and honour you ; and that you believe already , or else you do not do we justice . I suppose you will be go out of town soon , now the parliament be rise . my be resolve to put he proxy into another hand , and intend I believe , to take my brother 's advice in it . both the and he Lordship be highly pleased with my brother 's moderate and independent principles . he have get great credit among all unprejudiced man , by the part he act throughout the last session , in which he have show , that he would no more join to distress and clog the wheel of government , by a unreasonable opposition , than he would do the dirty work of any administration . as he have so noble a fortune and want nothing of any body , he would be doubly to blame , to take any other part than that of he country , in which he have so great a stake . may he act _out of the house , and _in_ the house with equal honour ; and he will be he country 's pride , and you pride , and mine too ! which be the wish of _you affectionate sister , . . my , I have be a little in disorder , that I have . some few rub have happen . I hope they will be happily remove , I be unwilling to believe all that be say . but this be a wicked town . I wish we be out of it . yet I see not when that will be . I wish . would permit I and my to go into . but I do not care to leave he behind I , neither ; and he be not
not inclin to go . excuse my brevity , my dearest lady -- but I must break off , with only assure you ladyship , that I be , and ever will be , _you oblige and grateful , my , I understand thing be not so well as I wish . if you think my come up to town , and reside with you , while you stay , will be of service , or help you to get out of it , I will set out directly . I will pretend some indisposition , and a desire of consult the physician ; or any thing you shall think fit to be do , by _you affectionate sister , and faithful friend , . my , a thousand thanks for you goodness to I ; but I hope all will be well . I hope will enable I to act so prudent a part , as will touch he generous breast . be pleased to tell I what you ladyship have hear ; but it become not I , I think , till I can not help it , to make any appeal ; for I know those will not be excuse ; and I do all I can to suppress my uneasiness before he . but I pay for it , when I be alone . my nursery and my reliance on ( I should have say the latter first ) , be all my consolation . preserve and bless you , my good lady , and my noble lord ! ( but I be apt to think you ladyship 's presence will not avail ) , pray _you affectionate and oblige ,_ P.B. why do not my sweet girl subscribe _Sister , as usual ? I have do nothing amiss to you ! I love you dearly , and ever will . I can not help my brother 's fault . but I hope he treat you with politeness and decency . he shall be none of my brother if he do not . I rest a great deal upon you prudence : and it will be very meritorious , if you can overcome yourself , so as to act unexceptionably , though it may not be deserve on this occasion . for in do so , you will have a triumph over nature itself ; for , my dear girl , as you have formerly owned , you have a little touch of jealousy in you composition . what I have hear , be no secret to any body . the injured party be generally the last who hear in these case , and you shall not first be tell anything by I that must _afflict you , but can not you , more than it do _me _. give you patience and comfort ! the wicked lady have a deal to answer for , to disturb such a uncommon happiness . but no more , than that I be _your ever- affectionate sister , . . I be all impatience to hear how you conduct yourself upon this try occasion . let I know what you have hear , and _how you come to hear it . letter LXIX why do not I subscribe ? ask my dearest Lady Davers .-- I have not have the courage to do it of late . for my title to that honour arise from the dear , thrice dear . and how long I may be permit to call he mine , I can not say . but since you command it , I will call you ladyship by that beloved name , let the rest happen as shall see fit . can not be unpolite , in the main ; but he be cold , and a little cross , and short in he speech to I . I try to hide my grief from everybody , and most from he : for neither my parent , nor know anything from I . , from whom I seldom hide any thing , as she be on the spot with I , hear not my complainings , nor my uneasiness ; for I would not lessen the dear man . he may _yet see the error of the way he be in . grant it , for he own sake as well as mine .-- I be even sorry you ladyship be afflict with the knowledge of the matter . the unhappy lady ( forgive she ! ) be to be pitie : she love he , and have strong passion , and be unused to be control , be lose to a sense of honour and justice . -- from these wicked masquerade spring all the unhappiness ; my be too amiable , and meet with a lady who be no nun , but in habit . every one be take with he in that habit , so suit to the natural dignity of he person !--o these wicked masquerade ! I be all patience in appearance , all uneasiness in reality . I do not think I could , especially in _this most _affect point , be such a hypocrite . you ladyship know not what it have cost I , to be able to assume that character ! yet my eye be swell with crying , and look red , although I be always breathe on my hand , and pat they with it , and my warm breath , to hide the distress that will , from my overcharged heart , appear in they . then he say , " what be the matter with the little fool ! you be always in this way of late ! what ail you , ? " " only a little vapourish , !-- do not be angry at I !-- Billy , I think , be not very well ! " " this boy will spoil you
you temper : at this rate , what should be you joy , will become you misfortune . do not receive I in this manner , I charge you . " " in what manner . ? I always receive you with a grateful heart ! if any thing trouble I , it be in you absence : but see , " ( then I try to smile , and seem pleased ) , " I be all sunshine , now you be come !-- do not you see I be ? " " yes , you sunshine of late be all through a cloud ! I know not what be the matter with you . you temper will alter , and then -- " " it sha not alter , -- it sha not -- if I can help it . " and then I kiss he hand ; that dear hand , that , perhaps , be last about he more beloved Countess 's neck -- reflection ! but come , may - be I think the worst ! to be sure I do ! for my apprehension be ever aforehand with event ; and bad must be the case , if it be worse than I think it . you command I to let you know _what I have hear , and how I _come to hear it . I tell you ladyship in one of my former that two gentleman bring up to the law , but above the practice of it , though I doubt , not above practice less honourable , have visit we on come to town . they have be often here since , particularly : and sometimes by himself , when . have happen to be out : and he it be , as I guess , that give I , at the wicked masquerade , the advice to look after my _Musidorus _. I do not like they visit , and _his_ much less : for he seem to be a man of intriguing spirit . but about three week ago , set out upon a party of pleasure to , he come and pretend great business with I . I be at breakfast in the parlour , only Polly attend I , and admit he , to drink a dish of chocolate with I . when Polly have stept out , he tell I , after many apology , that he have discover who the nun be at the masquerade , that have engage . I say it be very indifferent to I who the lady be . he reply ( make still more apology , and pretend great reluctance to speak out ) , that it be no less a lady than the young Countess Dowager of ----, a lady note for she wit and beauty , but of a gay disposition , though he believe not yet culpable . I be alarm ; but would not let he see it ; and tell , that I be so well satisfi in . 's affection for I , and he well - know honou , that I could not think myself oblige to any gentleman who should endeaavor to give I a less opinion of either than I ought to have . he then bluntly tell I , that the very party be upon , be with the Countess for one , and ----, who have marry she sister . I say , I be glad he be in such good company , and wish he every pleasure in it . he hope , he say , he might trust to my discretion , that I would not let know from whom I have the information : that , indeed , he motive in mention it be self - interest ; have presume to make some overture of a honourable nature to the Countess , in he own behalf ; which have be reject since that masquerade night : and he hope the prudent use I would make of the intimation , might somehow be a means to break off that correspondence , before it be attend with bad consequence . I tell he coldly , though it sting I to the heart , that I be fully assure of . honour ; and be sorry he , , have so bad a opinion of a lady to whom he profess so high a consideration . and rise up -- " will you excuse I , Sir , that I can not attend at all to such a subject as this ? I think I ought not : and so must withdraw . " " only , Madam , one word . " he offer to take my hand , but I would not permit it . he then swore a great oath , that he have tell I he true and only motive ; that letter have pass between the Countess and , add , " but I beg you will keep it within you own breast ; else , from two such hasty spirit as he and mine , it might be attend with still worse consequence . " " I will never . , enter into a subject that be not proper to be communicate every tittle of it to ; and this must be my excuse for withdrawing . " and away I go from he . you ladyship will judge with how uneasy a heart ; which become more so , when I sit down to reflect upon what he have tell I . but I be resolve to give it as little credit as I could , or that any thing would come of it , till . own behaviour should convince I , to my affliction , that I have some reason to be alarme : so I open not my lip about it , not even to . at .' return
return , I receive he in my usual affectionate and unreserved manner : and he behave himself to I with he accustom goodness and kindness : or , at least , with so little difference , that have not 's officiousness make I more watchful , I should not have perceive it . but next day a letter be brotch by a footman for . he be out : so give it to I . the superscription be a lady 's write : the seal , the 's , with a coronet . this give I great uneasiness ; and when come in , I say , " here be a letter for you . ; and from a lady too ! " " what then , " say he , with quickness . I be baulk , and withdrew . for I see he turn the seal about and about , as if he would see whether I have endeavoure to look into it . he need not to have be so afraid ; for I would not have do such a thing have I know my life be to depend upon it . I go up , and could not help weeping at he quick answer ; yet I do my endeavour to hide it , when he come up . " be not my girl a little inquisitive upon I just now ? " " I speak pleasantly . -- but you be very quick on you girl . " " 'Ti my temper , my dear -- you know i mean nothing . you should not mind it . " " I should not , , if I have be _use to it . " he look at I with sternness , " do you doubt my honour , ? " " _Madam !_ I do you say . ?-- I will not take that word ! -- dear Sir , call it back -- I will not be call !_-- call I you girl , you rustic , you Pamela -- call I any thing but _Madam !_ " " my charmer , then , my life , my soul : will any of those do ? " and salute I : " but whatever you do , let I not see that you have any doubt of my honour to you . " " the very mention of the word , dear , be a security to I ; I want no other ; I can not doubt : but if you speak short to I , how shall I bear that ? " he withdraw , speak nothing of the contents of he letter ; as I dare say he would , have the subject be such as he choose to mention to I . we be alone , after supper , I take the liberty to ask he , who be of he party to ? he name the Viscountess ---, and she lord , , and he daughter , and he lady : " and I have a partner too , my dear , to represent you . " " I be much oblige to the lady , , be she who she would . " " why , my dear , you be so engage in you nursery ! then this be a sudden thing ; as you know I tell you . " " , , as long as it be agreeable to you , I have nothing to do , but to be pleased with it . " he watch my eye , and the turn of my countenance -- " you look , , as if you would be glad to return the lady thanks in person . shall I engage she to visit you ? she long to see you . " " -- , " hesitate I , " as you please -- I can not -- I can not be displease -- " " _Displease ?_ " interrupt he : " why that word ? and why that hesitation in you answer ? you speak very volubly , my dear , when you be not move . " " dear , " say I , almost as quick as he be , " why should I be move ? what occasion be there for it ? I hope you have a better opinion of I than -- " " than what , ?-- what would you say ? I know you be a little jealous rogue , I know you be . " " but , dear , why do you impute jealousy to I on _this score ?-- what a creature must I be , if you could not be abroad with a lady , but I must be jealous of you ?-- no , , I have reason to rely upon you honour ; and I _do_ rely upon it ; and -- -- " " and what ? why , my dear , you be give I assurance , as if you think the case require it ! " " ah ! " think I , " so it do , I see too plainly , or apprehend I do ; but I durst not say so , nor give he any hint about my informant ; though now confirm of the truth of what have say . " yet I resolve , if possible , not to alter my conduct . but my frequent weeping , when by myself , could not be hide as I wish ; my eye not keep my heart 's counsel . and this give occasion to some of the stern word which I have mention above . all that he further say at this time be , with a negligent , yet a determine air -- " well , , do not be doubtful of my honour . you know how much I love you
you . but , one day or other I shall gratify this lady 's curiosity , and bring she to pay you a visit , and you shall see you need not be asham of she acquaintance . " --" whenever you please , , " be all I care to say farther ; for I see he be upon the catch , and look steadfastly upon I whenever I move my lip ; and I be not a finish hypocrite , and he can read the line of one 's face , and the motion of one 's heart , I think . I be sure mine be a very uneasy one . but till I reflect , and weigh well the matter , it be worse ; and my natural imperfection of this sort make I see a necessity to be more watchful over myself , and to doubt my own prudence . and thus I reason when he withdraw : " here , " think I , " I have have a greater proportion of happiness without alloy , fall to my share , than any of my sex ; and I ought to be prepare for some trial . " t'Tis true , this be of the sorest kind : ' ti worse than death itself to I , who have a opinion of the dear man 's reformation , and pride myself not a little on that account . so that the blow be full upon my sore place . ' Tis on the side I could be the most easily penetrate . but Achille could be touch only in he heel ; and if he be to die by a enemy 's hand , must not the arrow find out that only vulnerable place ? my jealousy be that place with I , as you ladyship observe ; but it be seat deeper than the heel : it be in my heart . the barbed dart have find that out , and there it stick up to the very feather . " yet , " think I , " I will take care , that I do not exasperate he by upbraiding , when I should try to move he by patience and forbearance . for the breach of he duty can not warrant the neglect of _mine . my business be to reclaim , and not to proveak . and when , if it please , this storm shall be over -blown , let I not , by my present behaviour , leave any room for heart - burnings ; but , like a skilful surgeon , so heal the wound to the bottom , though the operation be painful , that it may not fester , and break out again with fresh violence , on future misunderstanding , if any shall happen . " well , but , " think I , " let the worst come to the worst , he perhaps may be so good as to permit I to pass the remainder of my day with my dear Billy , in , with my father and mother ; and so , when I can not rejoice in possession of a virtuous husband , I shall be employ in praying for he , and enjoy a two - fold happiness , that of do my own duty to my dear baby -- a pleasing entertainment this ! and that have comforte my worthy parent , and be comfort by they - - a no small consolation ! and who know , but I may be permit to steal a visit now - and - then to dear , and be call , and be deem a _faultless sister too ? " but remember , my dear lady , that if ever it come to this , I will not bear , that , for my sake , you shall , with too much asperity , blame you brother ; for I will be ingenious to find excuse or extenuation for he ; and I will now - and - then , in some disguise habit , steal the pleasure of see he and he happier Countess ; and give he , with a silent tear , my bless for the good I and mine have reap at he hand . but oh ! if he take from I my , who must , after all , be he heir , and give he to the cruel Countess , he will at once burst asunder the string of my heart ! for , oh , my happy rivaless ! if you tear from I my husband , he be in he own disposal , and I can not help it : nor can I indeed , if he will give you my . but this I be sure of , that my child and my life must go together ! you ladyship will think I rave . indeed I be almost craze at time . for the dear man be so negligent , so cold , so haughty , that I can not bear it . he say , just now , " you be quite altered , . " I believe I be . madam . but what can I do ? he know not that I know so much . I dare not tell he . for he will have I then reveal my intelligencer : and what may be the case between they ? I weep in the night , when he be asleep ; and in the day when he be absent : and I be happy when I can , unobserve , steal this poor relief . I believe already I have she as many tear as would dry my baby . how many more I may have to shed , only know ! for , of , after all my fortitude , and my recollection ,
, to fall from so much happiness , and so soon , be a try thing ! but I will still hope the best , and should this matter blow over , I shall be asham of my weakness , and the trouble I must give to you generous heart , for one so undeservedly favour by you , as _you oblige sister , and most humble servant ,_ P.B. dear madam , let no soul see any part of this we present correspondence , for you brother 's sake , and you sake , and my sake . MY , you need not be afraid of any body 's know what pass between we on this cutting subject . though I hear of it from every mouth , yet I pretend ' tis all falsehood and malice . yet will have it that there be more in it than I will own ; and that I know my brother 's wickedness by my pensive look . she will make a vow , she say , never to marry any man liive . I be greatly move by you affecting period . ! what a tempest do you raise in one 's mind , when you please , and lay it too , at you own will ! you colouring be strong ; but , I hope , you imagination carry you much farther than it be possible he should go . I be pleased with you prudent reasoning , and you wise resolution . I see nobody can advise or help you . only can ! and he direction you beg _so_ hourly , that I make no doubt you will have it . what vex I be , that when the noble uncle of this vile lady --( why do not you call she so as well as I ?)--expostulate with she on the scandal she bring upon she character and family , she pretend to argue ( foolish creature ! ) to polygamy : and say , she have rather be a certain gentleman 's second wife , than the first to the greatest man in . I leave you to you own workings ; but if I find you prudence unreward by the wretch , the storm you see raise at the , shall be nothing to the hurricane I will excite , to tear up by the root all the happiness the two wretch propose to themselves . do not let my intelligence , which be undoubt , grieve you over-much . try some way to move the wretch . it must be do by touch he generosity : he have that in some perfection . but how in _this_ case to move it , be beyond my power or skill to prescribe . bless you , my dearest ! you shall be my _only sister . and I will never own my brother , if he be so base to you superlative merit . once more , _from you sister and friend ,_ benefit . Daver . my , a thousand thanks for you kind , you truly sisterly letter and advice . be just return from a tour to , with the Countess , I believe , but be not sure . here I be force to leave off . let I scratch through this last surmise . it seem she be not with he . this be some comfort . he be very kind : and not be well when he come in , my grief pass off without blame . he have say many tender thing to I ; but add , that if I give myself so much uneasiness every time the child ail any thing , he would hire the nurse to overlay he . bless I . madam ! what hard - hear shocking thing be these man capable of say !-- the farthest from they heart , indeed ; so they have need -- for he be as glad of the child 's be better as I could be . in the morning he go out in the chariot for about a hour , and return in a good humour , say twenty agreeable thing to I , which make I _so_ proud , and _so_ pleased ! he be go out again . could I but find this matter happily conquer , for he own soul 's sake ! -- but he seem , by what you ladyship mention , to have carry this polygamy point with the lady . can I live with he . madam --_ought_ I -- if this be the case ? I have it under he hand , that the law of he country be sufficient to deter he from that practice . but alas ! he know not this countess then ! but here I must break off . he be return , and come up . " go into my bosom for the present , of letter dedicated to dear Lady Davers -- come to my hand the play employment , so unsuited to my present afflict mind ! " -- here he come ! o , ! my heart be almost broken !-- just now tell I , that the Countess Dowager and the Viscountess , she sister , be to be here to see my , and to drink tea with I , this very afternoon ! I be all confusion when he tell I this . I look around and around , and upon every thing but he . " will not my friend be welcome , ? " say he sternly . " o yes , very welcome ! but I have these wretch vapour so , that I wish I might be excuse -- I wish I might be allow to take a airing in the chariot for two or three hour ; for I shall not be fit to be see by such --
-- lady , " say I , half out of breath . " you will be fit to be see by nobody , my dear , if you go on thus . but , do as you please . " he be go , and I take he hand : " stay , dear Sir , let I know what you would have I do . if you would have I stay , I will . " " to be sure I would . " " well , , then I will . for it be hard , " think I , " if a innocent person can not look up in she own house too , as it now be , as I may say , to a guilty one ! guilty in she heart , at least !-- though , poor lady , I hope she be not so in fact ; and , if hear my prayer , never will , for all three of we sake . " but , madam , think of I , what a task I have !-- how my heart throb in my bosom ! how I tremble ! how I struggle with myself ! what rule I form for my behaviour to this naughty lady ! how they be dash in piece as soon as form , and new one take up ! and yet I doubt myself when I come to the test . but one thing will help I . I _pity the poor lady ; and as she come with the heart of a robber , to invade I in my lawful right , I pride myself in a superiority over this countess ; and will endeaavor to show she the country girl in a light which would better become _her_ to appear in . I must be force to leave off here ; for be just come in to receive he guest ; and I be in a sad flutter upon it . all my resolution fail I ; what shall I do ? of that this countess be come and go ! I have one comfort , however , in the midst of all my grief ; and that be in you ladyship 's goodness , which give I leave to assume the honoured title , that let what may happen , will always give I equal pride and pleasure , in subscrib myself , _you ladyship 's most obliged sister , and humble servant , my , I will now pursue my last affecting subject ; for the visit be over ; but a sad situation I be in with for all that : but , bad as it be , I will try to forget it , till I come to it in course . at four in the afternoon come in to receive he guest , whom he expect at five . he come up to I . I have just close my last letter ; but put it up , and set before I you ladyship 's play subject . " so , !-- how do you do now ? " you ladyship may guess , by what I write before , that I could not give any extraordinary account of myself - - " as well -- as well , , as possible ; " half out of breath . " you give yourself strange melancholy air of late , my dear . all that cheerfulness , which use to delight I whenever I see you , I be sorry for it , be quite vanished . you and I must shortly have a little serious talk together . " " when you please . . I believe it be only be use to this smoky thick air of !-- I shall be better when you carry I into the country . I dare say I shall . but I never be in so long before , you know , . " " all in good time , ! -- but be this the best appearance you choose to make , to receive such guest ? " " if it displease you . , I will dress otherwise in a minute . " " you look well in any thing . but I think you would have be better dress . yet it would never have less become you ; for of late you eye have lose that brilliancy that use to strike I with a lustre , much surpass that of the finest diamonds . " " I be sorry for it , . but as I never could pride myself in deserve such a kind of compliment , I should be too happy , forgive I , my dearest , if the failure be not rather in you eye , than in _mine_. " he look at I steadfastly . " I fear , -- but do not be a fool . " " you be angry with I . ? " " no , not I . " " would you have I dress better ? " " no , not I . if you eye look a little more brilliant , you want no addition . " down he go . strange short speech , these , my lady , to what you have hear from he dear mouth !--" yet they shall not rob I of the merit of a patient sufferer , I be resolve , " think I . now , my lady , as I doubt not my rival would come adorn with every outward ornament , I put on only a white damask gow , have no desire to vie with she in appearance ; for a virtuous and honest heart be my glory , I bless ! I wish the countess have the same to boast off ! about five , they ladyship come in the countess 's new chariot :
: for she have not be long out of she transitory mourning , and dress as rich as jewel , and a profusion of expense , could make she . I see they from the window alight . of how my heart throb !-- " lie still , " say I , " busy thing ! why all this emotion ?-- those shin ornament cover not such a guileless flatterer as thou . why then all this emotion ? " come up instantly from . I hasten down ; tremble , tremble , tremble , go my foot , in spite of all the resolution I have be endeavour so long to collect together . present the countess to I , both of we cover with blush ; but from very different motive , as I imagine . " the Countess of --- , my dear . " she salute I , and look , as I think , half with envy , half with shame : but one be apt to form people 's countenance by what one judge of they heart . " of too lovely , too charme rival ! " think I -- " would to heave I see less attraction in you ! " -- for indeed she be a charming lady ; yet she could not help call I , that be some pride to I : every little distinction be a pride to I now -- and say , she hope I would excuse the liberty she have take : but the character give of I by make she desirous of pay she respects to I . " of these villainous masquerade , " think I !--" you would never have want to see I , but for they , poor naughty , that be ! " present also the Viscountess to I ; I salute she ladyship ; she _sister_ salute _me_. she be a graceful lady ; better , as I hope , in heart , but not equal in person to she sister . " you have a charming boy , I be tell , Madam ; but no wonder from such a pair ! " " of dear heart , " think I , " I ' not it so ! " you ladyship may guess what I think farther . " will you ladyship see he now ? " say . he do not look down ; no , not one bit !--though the Countess play with she fan , and look at he , and at I , and then down by , a little consciously : while I wrap up myself in my innocence , my first flutter be over , and think I be superior , by reason of that , even to a Countess . with all she heart , she say . I ring . " Polly , bid nurse bring _my_ down . " --_My_ , say I , with a emphasis . I meet the nurse at the stair ' foot , and bring in my dear baby in my arm : " such a child , and such a mamma ! " say the Viscountess . " will you give master to my arm , one moment , madam ? " say the Countess . " yes , " think I , " much rather than my dear naughty gentleman should any other . " I _yield , it to she : I think she would have stifle it with she warm kiss . " sweet boy I charme creature , " and press it to she too lovely bosom , with such emotion , look on the child , and on , that I like it not by any means . " go , you naughty lady , " think I : but I durst not say so . " and go , naughty man , too ! " think I : " for you seem to look too much gratify in you pride , by she fondness for you boy . I wish I do not love you so well as I do ! " but neither , you ladyship may believe , do I say this . look at I , but with a bravery , I think , too like what I have be witness to , in some former scene , in as bad a cause . " but , " think I , " deliver I _than ; I will confide in he . he will now , I doubt not , restore thy heart to my prayer ; untainted , I hope , for thy own dear sake as well as mine . " the Viscountess take the child from she sister , and kiss he with great pleasure . she be a married lady . would to , the Countess be so too ! for never correspond , as I tell you ladyship once , with marry lady : so I be not afraid of _her_ love to my . " but let I , " say she , " have the pleasure of restoring master to he charming mamma . I think , " add she , " I never see a lovelier sight in my life , than when in he mamma 's arm . " " why , I _can not say , " say the Countess , " but master and he mamma do credit to one another . dear madam , let we have the pleasure of see he still on you lap , while he be so good . " I wonder the dear baby be so quiet ; though , indeed , he be generally so : but _he_ might surely , if but by sympathy , have complain for he poor mamma , though she durst not for herself . how apt one be to engage every thing in one 's distress , when it
it be deep ! and one wonder too , that thing animate and inanimate look with the same face , when we be greatly move by any extraordinary and interesting event . I sit down with my baby on my lap , look , I believe , with a righteous boldness ( I will call it so ; for well say the text , " the righteous be as bold as a lion _, " ) now on my , now on he papa , and now on the Countess , with such a _triumph in my heart ; for I see she blush , and look down , and the dear gentleman seem to eye I with a kind of conscious tenderness , as I think . a silence of five minute , I believe , succeed , we all four look upon one another ; and the little dear be awake , and star full upon I , with such innocent smile , as if he promise to love I , and make I amend for all . I kiss he , and take he pretty little hand in mine --" you be very good , my charmer , in this company ! " say I . I remember a scene , which make greatly for I in the papers you have see , when , instead of recriminating , as I might have do , before for harsh usage ( for , of my lady , you dear brother have a hard heart indeed when he pleasis ) , I only pray for he on my knee . and I hope I be not now too mean ; for I have dignity and a proud superiority in my vain heart , over they all . then it be not my part to be upon defiance , where I love , and where I hope to reclaim . besides , what have I do by that , but justifi , seemingly , by after act in a passionate resentment , to they minds , at least , they too wicked treatment of I ?-- moreover , you ladyship will remember , that know not that I be acquaint with he intrigue : for I must call it so . if he have , he be too noble to insult I by such a visit ; and he have tell I , I should see the lady he be at with . and this , break silence , he mention ; say , " I give you hope , my dear , that I should procure you the honour of a visit from a lady who put herself under my care at . " I bow my head to the Countess ; but my tear be ready to start , I kiss my : " Dearest baby , " say I , " you be not go to cry , be you ? " -- I would have have he just then to cry , instead of I . the tea equipage be brotch in . " Polly , carry the child to nurse . " I give it another kiss , and the Countess desire another . I grudge it , to think she naughty lip should so closely follow mine . she sister kiss it also , and carry he to . " take he away , " say he , " I owe he my blesse . " " of these young gentleman papa ! " say the Countess -- " they be like young unbroken horse , just put into the trace ! " -- " be they so ? " thing I . " Matrimony must not expect you good word , I doubt . " after tea , at which I be far from be talkative ( for I could not tell what to say , though I try , as much as I could not to appear sullen ) , desire the Countess to play one tune upon the harpsichord .-- she do , and sung , at he request , a italian song to it very prettily ; too prettily , I think . I want to find some fault , some great fault in she : but , of , she have too many outward excellency !-- pity she want 's a good heart . he could ask nothing , that she be not ready to oblige he ; indeed he could not . she desire I to touch the key . I would have be excuse ; but could not . and the lady commend my performance ; but neither my heart to play , nor my finger in playing , deserve they praise . _say , indeed -- " you play better sometimes , my dear . " -- " do I , ? " be all the answer I make . the Countess hope , she say , I would return she visit ; and so say the Viscountess . I reply , . would command I whenever he please . she say , she hope to be better acquaint -- ( " I hope not , " think I ) -- and that I would give she my company , for a week or so , upon the Forest : it seem she have a seat upon . " say , " add she , " you can not ride a single horse ; but we will teach you there . ' tTis a sweet place for that purpose . " " how come , " think I , " to tell _you_ that , Madam ? I suppose you know more of I than I do myself . " indeed , my lady , this may be too true ; for she may know what be to become of I ! I tell she , I be very much oblige to she ladyship ; and that
that direct all my motion . " what say _yout , ? " say the Countess . " I can not promise that . madam : for want to go down to , before we go to , and I be afraid I can not give she my company thither . " " then , , I sha not choose to go without you . " " I suppose not , my dear . but if you be dispose to oblige the Countess for a week , as you never be at -- " " I believe , , " interrupt I , " what with my little nursery , and _one_ thing or _another , I must deny myself that honour , for this season . " " well , , then I will expect you in . " I bow my head , and say , . would command I . they take leave with a politeness natural to they . , as he hand they to the chariot , say something in italian to the Countess : the be in what he say : she answer he with a downcast look , in the same language , half - pleased , half - serious , and the chariot drive away . " I would give , " say I , " a good deal , , to know what she ladyship say to you ; she look with so particular a meaning , if I may say so . " " I will tell you , truly , : I say to she , ' well , now you ladyship have see my -- be she not the charmingest girl in the world ? ' " she answer --' . be very grave , for so young a lady ; but I must need say she be a lovely creature . ' " " and do you say so . ? and do she ladyship so answer ? " and my heart be ready to leap out of my bosom for joy . but my folly spoilead all again ; for , to my own surprise , and great regret , I burst out into tear ; though I even sob to have suppress they , but could not ; and so I lose a fine opportunity to have talk to he while he be so kind ; for he be more angry with I than ever . what make I such a fool , I wonder ? but I have so long struggle with myself ; and not expect so kind a question from the dear gentleman , or such a favourable answer from the Countess , I have no longer any command of myself . " what ail the little fool ? " say he , with a wrathful countenance . this make I worse , and he add , " take care , take care , ! -- you will drive I from you , in spite of my own heart . " so he go into the best parlour , and put on he sword , and take he hat . I follow he -- " , ! " with my arm expand , be all I could say ; but he avoid I , put on he hat with a air ; and out he go , bid follow he . this be the dilemma into which , as I hint at the beginning of this letter , I have bring myself with . how strong , how prevalent be the passion of jealousy ; and thus it will show itself uppermost , when it _i uppermost , in spite of one 's most watchful regards ! my mind be so perplexed , that I must lay down my pen : and , indeed , you ladyship will wonder , all thing consider , that I could write the above account as I have do , in this cruel suspense , and with such apprehension . but writing be all the diversion I have , when my mind be oppress . past ten at . I have only time to tell you ladyship ( for the postman wait ) that be just come in . he be go into he closet , and have shut the door , and take the key on the inside ; so I dare not go to he there . in this uncertainty and suspense , pity and pray for _you ladyship 's afflict sister and servant , my , I will now proceed with my melancholy account . not know what to do , and . not come near I , and the clock strike twelve , I venture to send this billet to he , by . " , " I know you choose not to be invade , when retire to you closet ; yet , be very uneasy , on account of you abrupt departure , and heavy displeasure , I take the liberty to write these few line . " I own , , that the sudden flow of tear which involuntarily burst from I , at you kind expression to the Countess in my favour , when I have think for more than a month past , you be angry with I , and which have distress my weak mind beyond expression , might appear unaccountable to you . but have you kindly wait but one moment till this fit , which be rather owe to my gratitude than to perverseness , have be over ( and I know the time when you would have generously soothe it ) , I should have have the happiness of a more serene and favourable parting . " will you suffer I , , to attend you ? ( Polly shall wait you answer ) . I dare not come _without_ you permission ; for should you be as angry as you be , I
I know not how I shall bear it . but if you say I may come down , I hope to satisfy you , that I intend not any offence . do , dear , permit I to attend you , I can say no more , than that I be _your ever dutiful_ , " . " Polly return with the follow . " so , " think I , " a letter !-- I could have spare that , I be sure . " I expect no favour from it . so tremblingly , open it . " my , " I would not have you sit up for I . we be get apace into the matrimonial recrimination . you know the time !_-- so do I , my dear ! -- but it seem that the time be over with both ; and I have have the mortification , for some past week , to come home to a very different , than I use to leave all company and all pleasure for .-- I hope we shall better understand one another . but you can not see I at present with any advantage to yourself ; and I would not , that any thing farther should pass , to add to the regret of both . I wish you good rest . I will give you cause a fair hearing , when I be more fit to hear all you plea , and you excuse . I can not be insensible , that the reason for the concern you have lately shewn , must lie deeper than , perhaps , you will now own . as soon as you be prepared to speak all that be upon you mind , and I to hear it with temper , then we may come to a eclaircissement . when I be _your affectionate , & class . " my busy apprehension immediately suggest to I , that I be to be terrify , with a high hand , into a compliance with some new scheme or other that be project ; and it be near one , and hear nothing from , I bid Polly go to bed , think she would wonder at we intercourse by letter , if I should send again . so down I venture , my foot , however , trembl all the way , and tap at the door of he closet . " who be that ? " " I , : one word , if you please . do not be more angry , however , . " he open the door : " thus poor Hester , to she royal husband , venture she life , to break in upon he unbidden . but that eastern monarch , great as he be , extend to the fainting suppliant the golden sceptre ! " he take my hand : " I hope , my dear , by this tragedy speech , we be not to expect any sad catastrophe to we present misunderstanding . " " I hope not , . but ' tis all as and you shall please . I be resolve to do my duty , Sir , if possible . but , indeed , I can not bear this cruel suspense ! let I know what be to become of I . let I know but what be design for I , and you shall be sure of all the acquiescence that my duty and conscience can give to you pleasure . " " what _mean the dear creature ? what _mean my ? surely , you head , child , be a little affect ! " " I can not tell , , but it may ! -- but let I have my trial , that you write about . Appoint my day of hearing , and speedily too ; for I would not bear such another month , as the last have be , for the world . " " come , my dear , " say he , " let I attend you to you chamber . but you mind have take much too solemn a turn , to enter further now upon this subject . think as well of I as I do of you , and I shall be as happy as ever . " I weep , " be not angry , dear Sir : you kind word have just the same effect upon I now , as in the afternoon . " " you apprehension , my dear , must be very strong , that a kind word , as you call it , have such a effect upon you ! but let we wave the subject for a few day , because I be to set out on a little journey at four , and have not intend to go to bed , for so few hour . " when we come up , I say , " I be very bold . , to break in upon you ; but I could not help it , if my life have be the forfeit ; and you receive I with more goodness than I could have expect . but will you pardon I , if I ask , whither you go so soon ? and if you have intend to have go without take leave of I ? " " I go to , my dear . I should have steep up and take leave of you before I go . " " well , , I will not ask you , who be of you party : I will not -- no , " ( put my hand to he lip ) " do not tell I . : it may not be proper . " " do not fear , my dear ; I will not tell you : nor be I certain whether it be
be _proper_ or not , till we be come to a better understanding . only , once more , think as well of I as I do of you . " " would to , " think I , " there be the same reason for the one as for the other ! " I intend ( for my heart be full ) to enter further into this subject , so fatal to my repose : but the dear gentleman have no sooner laid he head on the pillow , but he fall asleep , or feign to do so , and that be as prohibitory to my talking as if he have . so I have all my own entertaining reflection to myself ; which give I not one wink of sleep ; but make I of so much service , as to tell he , when the clock struck four , that he should not ( though I do not say so , you may think , ) make my ready rivaless ( for I doubt not she be one of the party ) wait for he . he arise , and be dress instantly ; and salut I , bid I be easy and happy , while it be _yet in my own power . he say , he should be back on night , as he believe . and I wish he , most fervently , I be sure , health , pleasure , and safety . here , , must I end this letter . my next , will , perhaps contain my trial , and my sentence : give I but patience and resignation , and then whatever occur , I shall not be unhappy : especially while I can have , in the last resource , the pleasure of call myself _you ladyship 's most obliged sister and servant , * * * * * my dear , I will be prepare to write to you , as I have opportunity , not doubt but this must be a long letter ; and have some apprehension , that , as thing may fall out , I may want either head or heart to write to you ladyship , be I to defer it till the catastrophe of this cruel suspense . of what a happiness be I sunk from ! -- and in so few day too ! of the wicked masquerade ! the follow letter , in a woman 's hand , and sign , as you will see , by a woman 's name , and spelt as I spell it , will account to you ladyship for my beginning so heavily . it come by the penny - post .

" just above I call my state , a state of _cruel suspense _. but I recall the word : for now it be no longer suspense ; since , if this letter say truth , I know the worst : and there be too much appearance that it do , let the writer be who he will , or he or she motive what it will : for , after all , I be apt to fancy this a contrivance of 's , though , for fear of ill consequence , I will not say so . and now , Madam , I be endeavour , by the help of religion , and cool reflection , to bring my mind to bear this heavy evil , and to recollect what I _be , and how much more honourable a estate I _be in , than I could ever have expect to be in ; that my virtue and good name be secure ; and I can return innocent to my dear parent : and these be once the only pride of my heart . in addition to what I be then ( and yet I please myself with my prospect , poor as they be ) , I have honest parent , bountifully provide for , and you ever - dear brother for this blessing ! -- and not only provide for -- but make useful to he , to the amount of they provision , well - nigh ! there be a pride , my lady ! then I shall have better condition from he generosity to support myself , than I can wish for , or make use of . then I have my dear - o be contente , too charming , and too happy rival , with my husband ; and tear not from I my dearest baby , the , the beloved pledge , of we happier affections , and the dear remembrance of what I once be !-- a thousand pleasing prospects , that have begin to daw on my
my mind , I can bear to have dissipate ! but I cannot , indeed I can not ! permit my dear . son and here to be tear from I . but I be run on in a strain that shew my impatience , rather than my resignation ; yet some struggle must be allow I : I could not have love , as I love , if I could easily part with my interest in so belove a husband .-- for my interest I _will_ part with , and sooner die , than live with a gentleman who have another wife , though I be the first . let countess , if they can , and lady of birth , choose to humble themselves to this baseness . the low - bear can not stoop to it . pardon I ; you know I only write this with a view to this poor lady 's answer to she noble uncle , of which you write I word . Friday be now conclude . I hope I be much calmer . for , be disappoint , in all likelihood , in twenty agreeable scheme and project , I be now form new one , with as much pleasure to myself as I may . I be think to try to get good with I . you must not , madam , be too much concerned for I . after a while , I shall be no unhappy person ; for though I be thankful for my splendid fortune , and should have be glad , to be sure I should , of continue in they , with so dear a gentleman ; yet a high estate have never such dazzling charms with I as it have with some : if it have , I could not have resist so many temptation , possibly , as enable I to resist . Saturday night be now come . ' Tis nine , and no .--" of why , " as make the mother of say , " be he chariot so long in come ? why tarry the wheel of he chariot ? " I have this note now at eleven o'clock : " my , " I dispatch the messenger , lest , expect I this night , you should be uneasy . I shall not be with you till , when I hope to dine with my dearest life . _Ever affectionately yours _. " so I will go up and pray for he , and then to bed . -- yet ' ttis a sad thing !-- I have have but poor rest for a great while ; nor shall have any till my fate be decided .-- hard - hearted man , he know under what uneasiness he leave I ! , . if hear my yesterday 's , and indeed my hourly , prayer , the dear man will be good still ; but my ach heart , every time I think what company he be in ( for I find the Countess be _certainly one of the party ) , bode I little satisfaction . he be come ! he be come ! now , just now , come ! I will have my trial over before this night be past , if possible . I will go down and meet he with love unfeigned , and a duty equal to my love , although he may forget he to I . if I conquer myself on this occasion , I conquer nature , as you ladyship say : and then , by 's , I can conquer every thing . they have take they house , I suppose : but what need they , when they will have one in , and one in ? but they know best . bless he , and reform she ! that be all the harm I wish they , or will wish they ! my dear . have receive I with great affection and tenderness . sure he can not be so bad ! -- sure he cannot ! " I know , my dear , " say he , " I leave you in great anxiety ; but ' ti a anxiety you have bring upon yourself ; and I have not be easy ever since I part from you . " " I be sorry for it , . " " why , my dear love , there be still a melancholy air in you countenance : indeed , it seem mingl with a kind of joy ; I hope at my return to you . but ' tis easy to see which of the two be the most natural . " " you should see nothing . , that you would not wish to see , if I could help it . " " I be sorry you cannot . but I be come home to hear all you grievance , and to redress they , if in my power . " " when , , be I to come upon my trial ? I have much to say . I will tell you everything I think . and , as it may be the last _grievance , as you be pleased to call they , I may ever trouble you with , you must promise to answer I not one word till I have do . for , if it do but hold , I have great courage , indeed I you do not know half the sauciness that be in you girl yet ; but when I come upon my trial , you will wonder at my boldness . " " what mean my dearest ? " take I into he arm . " you alarm I exceedingly , by this move sedateness . " " do not let it alarm you . ! I mean nothing but good ! --but I have
have be prepare myself to tell you all my mind . and as a instance of what you may expect from I , sometimes , , I will be you judge , and put home question to you ; and sometimes you shall be mine , and at last pronounce sentence upon I ; or , if you will not , I will upon myself ; a severe one to I , it shall be , but a agreeable one , perhaps , to you !-- when come on the trial . ? " he look steadily upon I , but be silent . and I say , " but do not be afraid , , that I will invade you province ; for though I shall count myself you judge , in some case , you shall be judge paramount still . " " dear charmer of my heart , " say he , and clasp I to he bosom , " what a _new_ PAMELa have I in my arm ! a mysterious charmer ! let we instantly go to my closet , or yours , and come upon we mutual trial ; for you have fire my soul with impatience ! " " no , , if you please , we will dine first . I have hardly eat any thing these four day ; and you company may give I a appetite . I shall be pleased to sit down at table with you . , " take he hand , and try to smile upon he ; " for the moment I have of you company , may be , some time hence , very precious to my remembrance . " I be then force to turn my head , to hide from he my eye , brimful as they be of tear . he take I again into he arm :--" my dearest , if you love I , distract not my soul thus , by you dark and mysterious speeches . you be displease with _me_, and I think I have reason , of late , to take something amiss in _your_ conduct ; but , instead of you suffering by my anger , you have word and a air that penetrate my very soul . " " of , , treat I not thus kindly ! put on a angrier brow , or how shall I retain my purpose ? how shall I ! " " dear , dear creature ! make not use of _all_ you power to melt I ! of it be enough . for there be eloquence in you eye I can not resist ; but in you present solemn air , and affect sentence , you mould I to every purpose of you heart ; so that I be a mere machine , a passive instrument , to be play upon at you pleasure . " " dear , kind sir , how you revive my heart , by you goodness ! perhaps I have only be in a frightful dream , and be but just now awaken . -- but we will not anticipate we trial . only , , give order , that you be not to be speak with by any body , when we have dine ; for I must have you all to myself , without interruption . " just as I have say this , a gentleman call , I retire to my chamber , and write to this place . dismiss he friend , without ask he to dine ; so I have he all to myself at dinner -- but we say little , and sit not above a quarter of a hour ; look at each other : he , with impatience , and some seem uneasiness ; I with more steadiness , I believe , but now and then a tear start . I eat but little , though I try all I could , and especially as he help I , and court I with tenderness and sweetness -- of why be ever such thing as _masquerade permit in a nation ! I choose to go into _my closet rather than into _he ; and here I sit , wait the dear gentleman 's come up to I . if I keep but my courage , I shall be pleased . I know the worst , and that will help I ; for he be too noble to use I roughly , when he see I mean not to provoke he by upbraiding , any more than I will act , in this case , beneath the character I ought to assume as he wife . come up , with great impatience in he look . I meet he at the chamber door , with a very sedate countenance , and my heart be high with my purpose , and support I better than I could have expect . -- yet , on recollection , now I impute to myself something of that kind of magnanimity , that be will not to inspire the innocent sufferer of old , for a still worthier cause than mine ; though they motives could hardly be more pure , in that one hope I have , to be a humble means of save the man I love and honour , from error that might be fatal to he soul . I take he hand with boldness :-- " dear Sir , " lead he to my closet , " here be the bar at which I be to take my trial , " point to the back of three chair , which I have place in a join row , leave just room to go by on each side . " you must give I , Sir , all my own way ; this be the first , and perhaps the last time , that I shall desire it .--
.-- , dear Sir , " turn my face from he , " look not upon I with a eye of tenderness : if you do I may lose my purpose , important to I as they be ; and however fantastic my behaviour may seem to you , I want not to move you passion ( for the good impression make upon they may be too easily dissipate by the wind of _sense _, ) but _you reason ; and if that can be do , I be safe , and shall fear no relapse . " " what mean all this parade , my dear ? let I perish , " that be he word , " if I know how to account for _you , or you _humour_. " " you _will , presently . . but give I all my way -- I pray you do -- this one time only ! " " well , so , this be you bar , be it ? there be a elbow - chair , I see ; take you place in it , , and here I will stand to answer all you question . " " no , , that must not be . " so I boldly lead he to the elbow - chair . " you be the judge , ; it be I that be to be try . yet I will not say I be a criminal . I know I be not . but that must be prove , , you know . " " well , take you way ; but I fear for you head , my dear , in all this . " " I fear only my heart , , that be all ! but there you must sit -- so here , " ( retire to the three chair , and lean on the back , ) " here I stand . " " and now , my dearest , you must begin first ; you must be my accuser , as well as my judge . " " I have nothing to accuse you of , my dear , if I _must give in to you move whimsy . you be everything I wish you to be . but for the last month you have seem to be uneasy , and have not do I the justice to acquaint I with you reason for it . " " I be in hope my reason might have prove to be no reason ; and I would not trouble you with my ungrounded apprehension . but now , , we be come directly to the point ; and methink I stand here as do before ; and like that poor prisoner , if I , Sir , reason of _righteousness , temperance , and _judgment to come_ , even to make you , as the great Felix do , tremble , do not put I off to _another day , to a _more convenient season , as that do ; for you must bear patiently with all that I have to say . " " , uncommon girl I how unaccountable be all this !-- Pr'ythee , my dear , " and he pull a chair by he , " come and sit down by I , and without these romantic air let I hear all you have to say ; and teaze I not with this parade . " " no , , let I stand , if you please , while I can stand ; when weary I will sit down at my bar . " now , , since you be so good as to say , you have nothing but change of temper to accuse I of , I be to answer to that , and assign a cause ; and I will do it without evasion or reserve ; but I beseech you say not one word but yes or no , to my question , till I have say all I have to say , and then you shall find I all silence and resignation . " " well , my strange dear ! -- but sure you head be a little turn !-- what be you question ? " " , , the -- I speak boldly ; the cause require it -- who follow you at the every where , be not the Countess of --? " " what then , my dear :" ( speak with quickness ,) --" I _thotch the occasion of you sullenness and reserve be this !-- but , -- " " , , " interrupt I , " only yes , or no , if you please : I will be all silence by - and - by . " " yes , then . " -- " well , , then let I tell you , for I _ask_ you not ( it may be too bold in I to multiply question , ) that she _love you ; that you correspond by letter with she -- yes , , _before that letter from she ladyship come , which you receive from my hand in so short and angry a manner , for fear of my curiosity to see its contents , which would have be inexcusable in I , I own , if I have . you have talk over to she all you polygamy notion , and she seem so well convince of they , as to declare to she noble uncle ( who expostulate with she on the occasion she give for talk , ) that she have rather be a certain gentleman 's second wife , than the first to the greatest man in : and you be but just return from a journey to , in which that lady be a party ; and the motive for it , I be acquaint with , by this letter .
. " he be displease , and frown : I look down , be resolve not to be terrify , if I could help it . " I have caution you , ---- " " I know you have , , " interrupt I ; " but be pleased to answer I . have not the Countess take a house or lodging at ? " " she have ; and what then ? " " and be she ladyship there , or in town ? " " _-- and what then ? " " be you to go to , , soon , or not ?-- be pleased to answer but that one question . " " I _will_ know , " rise up in anger , " you informant , . " " dear Sir , so you shall , in proper time : you shall know all , when I be convinced , that you wrath will not be attend with bad consequence to yourself and other . that be wholly the cause of my reserve in this point ; for I have not have a thought , since I have be yours , that I wish to be conceal from you . -- but you knowledge of the informant make nothing at all as to the truth of the information -- will I press you too home . I doubt not , you be soon to return to ? " " I _am _, and what then ?-- must the consequence be crime enough to warrant you jealousy ? " " dear Sir , do not be so angry , " still look down ; for I durst not trust myself to look up . " I do not do this , as you letter charge I , in a spirit of matrimonial recrimination : if you do not _tell_ I , that you see the Countess with pleasure , I _ask_ it not of you ; nor have I anything to say by way of upbraiding . ' Ti my misfortune , that she be too lovely , and too attractive : and it be the less wonder , that a fine young gentleman as you be , and a fine young lady as she be , should engage one another 's affections . " I know every thing , except what this letter which you shall read presently , communicate , when you bring the two noble sister to visit I : hence proceed my grief ; and should I , , have deserve to be what I be , if I be _not_ grieve ? have help I , and have answer my supplication , and enable I to act this new uncommon part before you at this imaginary bar . you shall see , , that as , on one hand , I want not , as I say before , to move you passion in my favour ; so , on the other , I shall not be terrify by you displeasure , dread by I as it use to be , and as it will be again , the moment that my raise spirit sink down to they usual level , or be divert from this my long meditate purpose , to tell you all my mind . " I repeat , then , , that I know all this , when the two noble sister come to visit you poor girl , and to see you . yet , _grave_ as the Countess call I , ( dear Sir ! might I not well be grave , know what I know ? ) do I betray any impatience of speech or action , or any discomposure ? " no , , " put my hand on my breast , " _here all my discomposure lay , vehemently struggle , now and then , and want that vent of my eye , which it seem ( overcome by my joy , to hear myself favourably speak of by you and the lady , ) it _too soon make itself . but I could not help it -- you might have see . , I could not ! " but I want neither to recriminate nor expostulate ; nor yet , , to form excuse for my general conduct ; for that you accuse not in the main -- but be pleased , , to read this letter . it be brotch by the penny - post , as you will see by the mark . who the writer be , I know not . and do _yout , , that knowledge , and you resentment upon it , will not alter the fact , or give it a more favourable appearance . " I step to he , and give he the letter , come back to my bar , and sit down on one of the chair while he read it , dry my eye ; for they would overflow as I talk , do what I could . he be much move at the contents of this letter ; call it malice , and hope he might find out the author of it , say , he would advertise 500 guinea reward for the discoverer . he put the letter in he pocket , " well , , you believe all you have say , no doubt : and this matter have a black appearance , indeed , if you do . but who be you _first informant ?-- be that by letter or personally ? that Turner , I doubt not , be at the bottom of all this . the vain coxcomb have have the insolence to imagine the Countess would favour a address of he ; and be enraged to meet with a repulse ; and have take libertie upon it , that have give birth to all the scandal scatter about on this occasion . nor
nor do I doubt but he have be the serpent at the ear of my . " I stand up at the bar , and say , " do not be too hasty , , in you judgment -- you _may be mistaken . " " but _am_ I mistaken , ?-- you never tell I a untruth in case the most important to you to conceal . I mistaken ? " " dear Sir , if I should tell you it be _not , you will guess at somebody else : and what avail all this to the matter in hand ? you be you own master , and must stand or fall by you own conscience . grant that _that may acquit you ! --but my intention be not either to accuse or upbraid you . " " but , my dear , to the fact then :-- this be a malicious and a villainous piece of intelligence , give you , perhaps , for the sake of design and view , that may not yet be proper to be avow . " " by 's , , I defy all design and view of any one , upon my honour ! " " but , my dear , the charge be basely false : we have not agree upon any such way of life . " " well , , all this only prove , that the intelligence may be a little premature . but now let I , Sir , sit down one minute , to recover my failing spirit , and then I will tell you all I purpose to do , and all I have to say , and that with as much brevity as I can , for fear neither my head nor my heart should perform the part I have be so long in endeavouring to prevail upon they to perform . " I sit down then , he take out the letter , and read it again with much vexation and anger in he countenance ; and after a few tear and sob , that would need be so officious as to offer they service , unbidden , and undesired , to introduce what I have to say ; I rise up , my foot trembling , as well as my knee ; which , however , lean against the seat of the chair , that make my bar , as my hand hold by the back , tolerably support I , I clear my voice , wip my eye , and say : " you have all the excuse , dear , that a gentleman can have in the object of you present passion . " " present passion , ! " " dear Sir , hear I without interruption . " the Countess be a charming lady . she excel you poor girl in all those outward graces of form , which you kind fancy ( more value by I than the opinion of all the world beside ) have make you attribute to I . and she have all those additional advantage , as nobleness of birth , of alliance , and deportment , which I want . ( happy for you , , that you have know she ladyship some month ago , before you disgrac yourself by the honour you have do I ! ) this therefore free you from the aggravate crime of those , who prefer , to they own lady , less amiable and less deserve person ; and I have not the sting which those must have , who be contemned and ill - treat for the sake of they inferior . yet can not the Countess love you better than you girl love you , not even for you person , which must , I doubt , be _her_ principal attachment ! when I can truly say , all noble and attract to the outward eye as it be , that be the least consideration by far with I : no , , you generous and beneficent mind , be the principal object of my affection ; and my pride in hoping to be a humble mean , in the hand of , to bless you _hereafter_ as well as _here , give I more pleasure than all the blessing I reap from you name or you fortune . judge then , my dearest , my grief and disappointment . " but I will not expostulate : I will not , because it _must be to no purpose ; for could my fondness , and my watchful duty to you , have keep you steady , I should not now appear before you in this solemn manner : and I know the charms of my rival be too powerful for I to contmend with . nothing but divine grace can touch you heart : and that I expect not , from the nature of the case , should be instantaneous . " I will therefore . , dear as you be to I --( do not look with such tender surprise upon I ! ) give up you person to the happier , to my _worthier rival . for since such be you will , and seem to be you engagement , what avail it to I to oppose they ? " I have only to beg , that you will be so good as to permit I to go down to , to my dear parent , who , with many more , be dailly rejoice in you favour and bounty . I will there " ( hold up my fold hand ) " pray for you every hour of my life ; and for every one who shall be dear to you , not except the charming Countess . " I will never take you name into my lip , nor suffer any other in my hearing , but with
with reverence and gratitude , for the good I and mine _have_ reap at you hand : nor wish to be free from my obligation to you , except you shall choose to be divorce from I ; and if so I will give you wish all the forwardness I honourably can , with regard to my own character and yours , and that of you beloved baby . " but you must give I something worth living for along with you ; you and mine !-- unless it be you desire to kill I quite ! and then ' tis do , and nothing will stand in you happy Countess 's way , if you tear from my arm my _second_ earthly good , after I be deprive of you , my first . " I will there , , dedicate all my time to my first duty ; happier far , than once I could have hope to be ! and if , by any accident , and misunderstan between you , you should part by consent , and you will have it so , my heart shall be ever yours , and my hope shall be resume of be a instrument still for you future good , and I will receive you return ever - value heart , as if nothing have happen , the moment I can be sure it will be wholly mine . " for , think not , dear , whatever be you notion of polygamy , that I will , be my life to depend upon it , consent to live with a gentleman , dear as , be my witness , " ( lift up my tearful eye ) " you be to I , who live in what I can not but think open sin with another ! you _know , , and I appeal to you for the purity , and I will aver piety of my motive , when I say this , that I _would not ; and as you do know this , I can not doubt but nay proposal will be agreeable to you both . and I beg of you , dear , to take I at my word ; and do not let I be torture , as I have be so many week , with such anguish of mind , that nothing but religious consideration can make supportable to I . " " and be you in , ? " come to I , and fold I in he arm over the chair 's back , the seat of which support my trembling knee , " can you so easily part with I ? " " I can , , and I will !-- rather than divide my interest in you , knowingly , with any lady upon earth . but say not , can I part with you . ; it be you that part with I : and tell I , Sir , tell I but what you have intend should become of I ? " " you talk to I , my dearest life , as if all you have hear against I be true ; and you would have I answer you , ( would you ? ) as if it be . " " I want nothing to convince I , , that the Countess love you : you know the rest of my information : judge for I , what I can , what I ought to believe !-- you know the rumour of the world concern you : even I , who stay so much at home , and have not take the least pain to find out my wretchedness , nor to confirm it , since I know it , have come to the hearing of it ; and if you know the licence take with both you character , and yet correspond so openly , must it not look to I that you value not you honour in the world 's eye , nor my lady hers ? I tell you , , the answer she make to she uncle . " " you tell I , my dear , as you be tell . be tender of a lady 's reputation -- for you own sake . no one be exempt from calumny ; and even word say , and the occasion of say they not know , may bear a very different construction from ' what they would have do , have the occasion be tell . " " this may be all true . sir : I wish the lady would be as tender of she reputation as I would be , let she injure I in you affections as she will . but can you say , , that there be nothing between you , that should _not be , accord to _my notion of virtue and honour , and accord to you _own , which I take pride in , before that fatal masquerade ? " you answer I not , " continue I ; " and may I not fairly presume you can not as I wish to be answer ? but come , dearest , " ( and I put my arm around he neck ) " let I not urge you too boldly . I will never forget you benefit , and you past kindness to I . I have be a happy creature : no one , till within these few week , be ever so happy as I . I will love you still with a passion as ardent as ever I love you . absence can not lessen such a love as mine : I be sure it cannot . " I see you difficulty . you have go too far to recede . if you can make it easy to you conscience , I will wait with patience my happier destiny ;
; and I will wish to live ( if I can be convince you wish I not to die ) in order to pray for you , and to be a directress to the first education of my dearest baby . " you sigh , dear Sy ; repose you beloved face next to my fond heart . ' tTis all you own : and ever shall be , let it , or let it not , be worthy of the honour in you estimation . " but yet , my dear , if one could as easily , in the prime of sensual youth , look twenty year backward , what a empty vanity , what a mere nothing , will be all those grosser satisfaction , that now give wing of desire to we debased appetite ! " motive of religion will have they due force upon _your_ mind one day , I hope ; as , bless be God , they have enable _me_ to talk to you on such a touching point ( after infinite struggle , I own , ) with so much temper and resignation ; and then , my dearest , when we come to that last bed , from which the piety of we friend shall lift we , but from which we shall never be able to raise ourselves ; for , dear Sir , you Countess , and you , and you poor Pamela , must all come to this !-- we shall find what it be will give we true joy , and enable we to support the pang of the die hour . think you , my dearest , " ( and I press my lip to he forehead , as he head be recline on my throbbing bosom , ) " that _then , in that important moment , what now give we the greatest pleasure , will have any part in we consideration , but as it may give we woe or comfort in the reflection ? " but I will not , of best beloved of my soul , afflict you farther . why should I thus sadden all you gaudy prospects ? I have say enough to such a heart as yours , if touch it . and if not , all I can say will be of no avail !-- I will leave you therefore to that , and to you own reflection . and after give you ten thousand thanks for you indulgent patience with I , I will only beg , that I may set out in a week for , with my dear Billy ; that you will receive one letter at least , from I , of gratitude and blessing ; it shall not be of upbraiding and exclamation . " but my child you must not deny I ; for I shall haunt , like he shadow , every place wherein you shall put my , if you should be so unkind to deny he to I ! -- and if you will permit I to have the dear with I , as you have almost lead I to hope , I will read over all the book of education , and digest they , as well as I be able , in order to send you my scheme , and to show you how fit , I hope you _indulgence , at least , will make you think I , of have two such precious trust repose in I ! " I be silent , wait in tear he answer . but he generous heart be touch , and seem to labour within he for expression . he come round to I at last , and take I in he arm ; " Exalt creature ! " say he : " noble - minded ! let no bar be put between we henceforth ! no wonder , when one look back to you first promise dawn of excellence , that you fuller day should thus irresistibly dazzle such weak eye as mine . whatever it cost I , and I have be inconsiderately lead on by blind passion for a object too charming , but which I never think equal to my , I will ( for it be yet , I bless , in my power ) , restore to you virtue a husband all you own . " " of , , " ( and I should have sunk with joy , have not he kind arm support I , ) " what have you say ?-- Can I be so happy as to behold you innocent as to deed ! God , of he infinite goodness , continue you both so !-- and , oh ! that the dear lady would make I as truly love she , for the graces of she mind , as I admire she for the advantages of she person ! " " you be virtue itself , my dearest life ; and from this moment I will reverence you as my tutelary angel . I shall behold you with awe , and implicitly give up myself to all you dictate : for what you _say , and what you _do_ , must be ever right . but I will not , my dearest life , too lavishly promise , lest you should think it the sudden effect of passion thus movingly touch , and which may subside again , when the soul , as you observe in you own case , sink to its former level : but this I promise ( and I hope you believe I , and will pardon the pain I have give you , which make I fear more than once , that you head be affect , so _uncommon , yet so like _yourself , have be the manner of you acting , ) that I will break off a correspondence that have
have give you so much uneasiness : and my may believe , that if I can be as good as my word in this point , she will never more be in danger of any rival whatever . " but say , my dear love , " add he , " say you forgive I ; and resume but you former cheerfulness , and affectionate regards to I , else I shall suspect the sincerity of you forgiveness : and you shall indeed go to , but not without I , nor you boy neither ; and if you insist upon it , the poor child you have wish so often and so generously to have , shall be give up absolutely to you disposal . " do you think . madam , I could speak any one distinct sentence ? no indeed I could not .

even when they be overbly to augment and redouble we joy !

I rejoice with you upon the turn this afflict affair have take , through you inimitable prudence , and a courage I think not in you . a wretch ! -- to give you so much discomposure ! -- but I will not , if he be good now , rave against he , as I be go to do . I be impatient to hear what account he give of the matter . I hope he will be able to abandon this -- I will not call she name ; for she love the wretch ; and that , if he be just to you_, will be she punishment . what care ought these young widow to take of they reputation ?-- and how watchful ought they to be over themselves ! -- she be hardly out of she weed , and yet must go to a masquerade , and tempt she fate , with all she passion about she , with a independence , and a affluence of fortune , that make she able to think of nothing but gratify they . she have good quality -- be generous -- be noble -- but have strong passion , and be thoughtless and precipitant . my lord come home last , with a long story of my brother and she : for I have keep the matter as secret as I could , for he sake and yours . it seem he have it from ----, uncle to the young , who be very earnest to bring on a treaty of marriage between she and he nephew , who be in love with she , and be a fine young gentleman ; but have hold back , on the libertie she have lately give herself with my brother . I hope she be innocent , as to fact ; but I know not what to say to it . he ought to be hang , if he do not say she be . yet I have great opinion of he veracity : and yet he be so bold a wretch !-- and she inconsideration be so great ! but lest I should alarm you fear , I will wait till I have the account he give you of this dark affair ; till when , I congratulate you upon the leave you have obtain to quit the town , and on you set out for a place so much nearer to . forgive I , ; but he be a intriguing wretch , and I would not have you to be too secure , lest the disappointment should be worse for you , than what you know before : but assure yourself , that I be in all case and event , _you affectionate sister and admirer _, b . Daver . from to ._ my , come back from to he time . every thing be in readiness , we set out with my baby , and he nurse . , when every thing in be settle by she direction , go to . we be meet by my father and mother in a chaise and pair , which you kind brother have present to they unknown to I , that they might often take the air together , and go to church in it ( which be at some distance ) on . the driver be clothed in a good brown cloth suit , but no livery ; for that my parent could not have borne , as . goodness make he consider . you ladyship must need think , how we be all overjoy at this meeting : for my own part I can not express how much I be transport when we arrive at the farm - house , to see all I delighte in , upon one happy spot together . be much pleased with the alteration here : and it be a sweet , rural , and convenient place . we be welcome into these part by the bell , and by the minister , and people of most note ; and be at church together on . be to set out on for , with my papers . a happy issue , attend that affair , I pray ! he have give I the follow particular of it , to the time of my trial , begin at the masquerade . he say , that at the masquerade , when , pleased with the fair 's shape , air and voice , he have follow she to a corner most unobserved , she say in , " why be my retirement invade , audacious ? " --" because , my dear nun , I hope you would have it so . " " I can no otherwise , " return she , " strike dead thy bold presumption , than to show thee my scorn and anger thus ! " -- " and she unmask surprise I , " say , " with a face as beautiful , but not so soft as my 's . " -- " and I , " say , " to show I can defy you resentment
resentment , will show you a countenance as intrepid as yours be lovely . " and so he draw aside he mask too . he say , he observe he fair nun to be follow wherever she go , by a mask habite like in , whose attention be fix upon she and he ; and he doubt not , that it be . so he and the fair take different way , and he join I and , and find I engage as I before related to you ladyship , and he at he elbow unexpected . that afterwards as he be engage in french with a lady who have the dress of a indian princess , and the mask of a , he fair nun say , in break spanish , " thou at all complexion ? -- by , I believe thou 'rt a rover ! " " I be try , " reply he in Italian , " whether I can meet with any lady comparable to my lovely . " " and what be the result ? " --" not one : no not one . " --" I wish you could not help be in earnest , " say she ; and slid from he . he engage she next at the sideboard , drink under she veil a glass of . " you know , , " say he , " there never be a sweeter mouth in the world than the Countess 's except you own . " she draw away the glass , as if unobserve by any body , to show I the lower part of she face . " I can not say , but I be strike with she charming manner , and a unreservedness of air and behaviour , that I have not before see so become . the place , and the freedom of conversation and deportment allow there , give she great advantage in my eye , although she habit require , as I think , a little more gravity and circumspection : and I could not tell how to resist a secret pride and vanity , which be but too natural to both sex , when they be take notice of by person so worthy of regard . " naturally fond of every thing that carry the face of a intrigue , I longe to know who this charme nun be . and next time I engage she , ' my good sister , ' say I , ' how happy should I be , if I might be admit to a conversation with you at you grate ! ' " 'Answer I , ' say she , ' thou bold , ' ( for that be a name she seem fond of , which give I to imagine , that boldness be a qualification she be not displease with . ' not unusual with we vain sex , " observ he , " to construe even reproach to we advantage , " ) 'i the lady here , whose shackle thou wearest ? '--' do I look like a man shackle , my fairest nun ?' --' no --no ! not much like such a one . but I fancy thy wife be either a Widow or a _Quaker _. ' --' neither , ' reply I , take , by equivocation , she question literally . " ' and be thou not a married wretch ? answer I quickly ! -- we be observ . ' --' no ,' say I .--'Swear to I , thou be not . ' --' by , then ;' for , my dear , I be no _wretch , you know .--'Enough ! ' say she , and slid away ; and the fanatic would fain have engage she , but she avoid he as industriously . " before I be aware , she be at my elbow , and , in , say , ' that fair Quaker , yonder , be the wit of the assemblee ; she eye seem always direct to thy motion ; and she person shew some intimacy have pass with somebody ; be it with thee ? '--' it would be my glory if it be , ' say I , ' be she face answerable to she person .' --' be it not ?'--'i long to know , ' " reply .--" I be glad thou dost not . " --" I be glad to hear my fair say that . " -- " Dost thou , " say she , " hate shackle ? or be it , that thy hour be not yet come ? " " I wish , " reply he , " this be not the hour , the very hour ! " pretending ( naughty gentleman !-- what way these man have ! ) to sigh . she go again to the side - board , and put she handkerchief upon it . follow , and observe all she motion . she drank a glass of lemonade , as he of ; and a person in a domino , suppose to be the , pass by , take up every one 's attention but . who ey she handkerchief , not doubt but she lay it there on purpose to forget to take it up . accordingly she leave it there ; and slipp by he , he , unobserved , as he believe , put it in he pocket , and at the corner find the cover of a letter -- " to the the Countess Dowager of ---- " that after this , the fair be so shy , so reserv , and see so studiously to avoid he , that he have no opportunity to return she handkerchief ; and the fanatic observe how she shunn he , say , in , " what , , have you do to
to you ? " " I find she to be a very coquette ; and tell she so ; and she be offend . " " how could you affront a lady , " reply he , " with such a _charming face ?_ " by that I have reason to think , " say , " that he have see she unmask ; and I say , ' it become not any character , but that you wear , to pry into the secret of other , in order to make ill - natured remark , and perhaps to take ungentlemanlike advantages . ' " " no man should make that observation , " return he , " whose view would bear pry into . " " I be nettle , " say , " at this warm retort , and draw aside my mask : ' would any man , who wear not a mask , tell I so ! ' " he take not the challenge , and slid from I , and I see he no more that night . " " so ! " think I , " another instance this might have be of the glorious consequence of masquerading . " of my lady , these masquerade be abominable thing ! the king , they say , meet with a free speaker that night : in truth , I be not very sorry for it ; for if monarch will lay aside they sovereign distinction , and mingle thus in masquerade with the worst as well as the highest ( I can not say _best ) of they subject , let them take the consequence . perhaps they might have a chance to hear more truth here than in they palace -- the only good that possibly can accrue from they -- that be to say , if they make a good use of it when they hear it . for you see , my monarch , though he tell the truth , as it happen , receive the hint with more resentment than thankfulness ! -- so , ' ti too likely do the monarch of we both . and now , my lady , you need not doubt , that so polite a gentleman would find a opportunity to return the she handkerchief !-- to be sure he would : for what man of honou would rob a lady of any part of she apparel ? and should he , that want to steal a heart content himself with a handkerchief ?-- no no , that be not to be expect . so , what do he do , but resolve , the very next day , after dinner , to pursue this affair : accordingly , the poor Quaker little think of the matter , away go she naughty , to find out he at she grate , or in she parlour rather . he ask for the Countess . be admit into the outward parlour -- she woman come down ; require he name and business . he name he mention not . he business be , to restore into she lady 's own hand , something she have dropt the night before .-- be desire to wait . I should have say , that he be dress very richly -- have no design at all to make conquest ; no , not he !-- of this wick love of intrigue !-- a kind of olive - coloured velvet , and fine brocad waistcoat . I say , when he take leave of I , " you be a charme , " and salute he , more pressingly than he return it ; but little do I think , when I plait so smooth he rich lace ruffle , and bosom , where he be go , or what he have in he plotting heart . he go in he own chariot , that he do : so that he have no design to conceal who he be -- but intrigue , a new conquest , vanity , pride !-- of these man !-- they have need talk of lady ! -- but it be half we own fault , indeed it be , to encourage they vanity . well , Madam , he wait till he stateliness be move to send up again , that he would wait on she ladyship some other time . so down she come , dress most richly , jewel in she breast , and in she hair , and ears -- but with a very reserved and stately air . he approach she -- I see he , dear saucy gentleman . you know , , what a noble manner of address he have . he take the handkerchief from he bosom with a air ; and kiss it , present it to she , say , " this happy estray , thus restore , beg leave , by I , to acknowledge its lovely owner ! " " what mean you , ?-- who be you , ?-- what mean you ? " " you ladyship will excuse I : but I be incapable of mean any thing but what be honourable . " --( , to be sure_ ) -- " this , madam , you leave last night , when the domino take up every one 's attention but mine , which be much better engage ; and I take the liberty to restore it to you . " she turn to the mark ; a coronet at one corner , " 'Tis true , , I see now it be one of mine : but such a trifle be not worthy of be bring by such a gentleman as you seem to be ; nor of my trouble to receive it in person . you servant , , might have deliver the bagatelle to mine . " -- " nothing
nothing should be call so that belong to the Countess of ----" -- " she be no Countess , , that _dropt_ that handkerchief , and a gentleman would not attempt to penetrate , _unbecomingly , through the disguise a lady think proper to assume ; especially at such a place where every enquiry should begin and end . " this , , from a lady , who have unmasked -- because _she would not be know _!-- very pretty , indeed !-- oh ! these slight cobweb air of modesty ! so easily see through . hence such advantage against we be take by the man . she have look out of she window , and see no arm quarter with he own ; for you know , my lady , I would never permit any to be procure for I : so , she doubt not , it seem , but he be a unmarried gentleman , as he have intimate to she the night before . he tell she it be impossible , after have see the finest lady in the world , not to wish to see she again ; and that he hope he do not , _unbecomingly , break through she ladyship 's reserve : nor have he make any enquiry , either on the spot , or off it ; have have a much better direction by accident . " as how , ? " say she , as he tell I , with so bewitch a air , between attentive and pleasant , that , bold gentleman , forget all manner of distance , so early too ! he clasp he arm around she waist , and salute she , struggle with anger and indignation , he say ; but I think little of that ! " Whence this insolence ? how , now , ! " be she word , and she ring the bell ; but he set he back against the door --( I never hear such boldness in my life , madam ! ) -- till she would forgive he . and , it be plain , she be not so angry as she pretend : for she woman come , she be calmer ;-- " , " say she , " fetch my snuff box , with the lavender in it . " she woman go ; and then she say , " you tell I , Sir , last night , of you intrepidness : I think you be the boldest man I ever meet with : but , , surely you ought to know , that you be not now in the Haymarket . " I think , truly , , the lady might have save herself that speech : for , upon my word , they neither of they wear mask -- though they ought to have put on one of blush -- I be sure I do for they , while I be write . she irresistible loveliness serve for a excuse , that she could not disapprove from a man she dislike not : and he irresistible -- may I say , assurance , madam ?-- find too ready a excuse . " well , but , , " say I , " pray , when she ladyship be make acquaint that you be a married gentleman , how then ?-- , do _she find it out , or do _you_ tell she ? " --" patience , my dear ! " --" well pray , , go on .-- what be next ? " " why , next , I put on a more respectful and tender air : I would have take she hand indeed , but she would not permit it ; and when she see I would not go till she lavender snuff come down ( for so I tell she , and she woman be not in haste ) , she seat herself , and I sit by she , and begin to talk about a charming lady I see the night before , after part with she ladyship , but not equal by any means to she : and I be confident this would engage she attention ; for I never know the lady who think herself handsome , that be not take by this topic . Flattery and admiration , , be the two principal engine by which we sex make they first approaches to yours ; and if you listen to we , we be sure , either by the sap or the mine , to succeed , and blow you up when ever we please , if we do but take care to suit ourselves to you particular foible ; or , to carry on the metaphor , point we battery to you weak side -- for the strongest fortress , my dear , be weaker in one place than another . " --" a fine thing , , " say I , " to be so learn a gentleman ! " --" I wish , however , " think I , " you have always come honestly by you knowledge . " " when the lavender snuff come down , we be engage in a agreeable disputation , which I have raise on purpose to excite she opposition , she have all the advantage in it ; and in order to my give it up , when she be intent upon it , as a mark of my consideration for she . " " I the less , , " say I , " at you boldness ( pardon the word ! ) with such a lady , in you first visit , because of she freedom , when mask , she unmask , and she handkerchief , and letter cover . to be sure , the lady , when she see , next day , such a fine gentleman and handsome equipage
equipage , have little reason , after she other freedom , to be so very nice with you as to decline a ensnar conversation , calculate on purpose to engage she attention , and to lengthen out you visit . but do she not ask you who you be ? " " she servant do on mine . and she woman ( for I know all afterwards , when we be better acquaint ) , whisper she lady , that I be . of ; and have a immense estate , to which they be so kind as to add two or three thousand pound a year , out of pure good will to I : I thank they . " " but pray , dear , what have you in view in all this ? do you intend to carry this matter , at first , as far as ever you could ? " --" I have , at first , my dear , no view , but such as pride and vanity suggest to I . I be carry away by inconsideration , and the love of intrigue , without even think about the consequence . the lady , I observ , have abundance of fine quality . I think I could converse with she , on a very agreeable foot , and she honou I know , at any time , would preserve I mine , if ever I should find it in danger ; and , in my soul , I prefer my to all the lady on earth , and question not , but that , and you virtue , would be another barrier to my fidelity . " in a word , therefore , pride , vanity , thoughtlessness , be my misguider , as I say . the Countess 's honour and character , and you virtue and merit , my dear , and my obligation to you , be my defences : but i find one should avoid the first appearance of evil . one know not one 's own strength . ' tTis presumptuous to depend upon it , where wit and beauty be in the way on one side , and youth and strong passion on the other . " " you certainly , , say right . but be pleased to tell I what she ladyship say when she know you be marry . " --" the Countess 's woman be in my interest , and let I into some of she lady 's secret , have a great share in she confidence ; and particularly acquaint I , how loth she lady be to believe I be marry . I have pay she three visit in town , and one to she seat upon the Forest , before she hear that I be . but when she be assure of it , and direct she Nelthorpe to ask I about it , and I readily own it , she be greatly incense , though nothing but general civility , and intimacy not inconsistent with honourable friendship , have pass between we . the consequence be , she forbad my ever see she again , and set out with she sister and the Viscount for , where she stay about three week . " I think I have already go too far , and blame myself for permit she so long to believe I single ; and here the matter have drop , in all probability , have not a ball , give by my ---- , to which , unknown to each other , we be both , as also the Viscountess , invite , bring we again together . the lady soon withdraw , with she sister , to another apartment ; and be resolve upon personal recrimination ( which be what a lady , who be resolve to break with a favoured object , should never trust herself with , ) send for I , and reproach I on my conduct , in which she sister join . " I own frankly , that gaiety , rather than design , make I give cause , at the masquerade , for she ladyship to think I be not marry ; for that I have a wife , with a thousand excellency , who be my pride , and my boast : that I hold it very possible for a gentleman and lady to carry on a innocent and honourable friendship , in a _family way ; and I be sure , when she and she sister see my spouse , they would not be displease with she acquaintance ; all that I have to reproach myself with , be , that after have , at the masquerade , give reason to think I be not marry , I have be both , _officiously , to say I be , although I never intend to conceal it . in short , I acquit myself so well with both ladie , that a family intimacy be consent to . I renew my visit ; and we account to one another 's honour , by enter upon a kind of Platonic system , in which sex be to have no manner of concern . " but , my dear , I must own myself extremely blameable , because I know the world and human nature , I will say , better than the lady , who never before have be trust into it upon she own foot : and who , notwithstand that wit and vivacity which every one admire in she , give herself little time for consideration . I ink , therefore , to have more carefully guard against inconveniency , which I know be so likely to arise from such intimacy ; and the rather , as I hint , because the lady have no apprehension at all of any : so that , my dear , if
if I have no excuse from human frailty , from youth , and the charms of the object , I be entirely destitute of any . " " I see , , " say I , " there be a great deal to be say for the lady . I wish I could say there be for the gentleman . but such a fine lady have be safe , with all she inconsideration ; and so ( forgive I . , ) would the gentleman , with all he intrigue spirit , have it not be for these vile masquerade . never , dear Sir , think of go to another . " --" why , my dear , those be least of all to be trust at these diversion , who be most desirous to go to they . -- of this I be now fully convinced . " --" well , , I long to hear more particular of this story : for this generous openness , now the affair be over , can not but be grateful to I , as it shew I you have no reserve , and tend to convince I , that the lady be less blameable than I apprehend : for I love , for the honour of my sex , to find lady of birth and quality innocent , who have so many opportunity of know and practise they duty , above what meaner person can have . " " well observ , my dear : this be like you generous and deep way of thinking . " " but , dear Sir , proceed -- you reconciliation be now effect ; a friendship quadripartite be commence . and the Viscountess and I be to find cement for the erecting of a edifice , that be to be devote to Platonic love . what , may I ask , come next ? and what do you design should come of it ? " " the journey , my dear , follow next ; and it be my fault you be not a party in it , both lady be very desirous of you company : but it be the time you be not go abroad , after you lie - in , so I excuse you to they . yet they both longe to see you : especially as by this time , you may believe , they know all you story : and besides , whenever you be mention , I do justice , as well to you mind , as to you person . " " well , , to be sure this be very kind ; and little be I dispose ( know what I do , ) to pass so favourable a construction in you generosity to I . " " my question to she ladyship at go away , whether you be not the charmingest girl in the world , which see you both together , rich as she be drest , and plain as you , give I the double pleasure ( a pleasure she say afterwards I exult in , ) of deciding in you favour ; my readiness to explain to you what we both say , and she not ungenerous answer , I think entitle I to a better return than a flood of tear ; which confirm I that you past uneasiness be a jealousy I be not willing to allow in you : though I should have be more indulgent to it have I know the grounds you think you have for it : and for this reason I leave you so abruptly as I do . " here , , . break off , refer to another time the conclusion of he narrative . I will here close this letter ( though possibly I may not send it , till I send the conclusion of this story in my next , ) with the assurance that I be _you ladyship 's obliged sister and servant , P.B. my dear lady , now I will proceed with my former subject : and with the greater pleasure , as what follow make still more in favour of the Countess 's character , than what go before , although that set it in a better light than it have once appear to I in . I begin as follow : " will you be pleased , , to favour I with the continuation of we last subject ? " --" I will , my dear . " --" you leave off , , with acquitt I for break out into that flood of tear , which occasion you abrupt departure . but , dear , will you be pleased , to satisfy I about that affect information , of you intention and my lady 's to live at together ? " " ' tTis absolute malice and falsehood . we intimacy have not proceed so far ; and , thoughtless as my sister 's letter suppose the lady , she would have spur at such a proposal , I dare say . " " well , but then , , as to the expression to she uncle , that she have rather have be a certain gentleman 's second wife ? " " I believe she might , in a passion , say something like it to he : he have be tea she ( from the time that I hold a argument in favour of that foolish topic _polygamy , in he company and he niece 's , and in that of she sister and the Viscount , ) with caution against conversing with a man , who , have , as he be pleased to say behind my back , marry beneath he , want to engage the affections of a lady of birth , in order to recover , by doubling that fault upon she , he lose reputation .
. " she despise he insinuation enough to answer he , that she think my argument in behalf of _polygamy be convince . this set he a raving , and he throw some coarse reflection upon she , which could not be repeat , if one may guess at they , by she be unable to tell I they ; and then to vex he more , and to revenge herself , she say something like what be report : which be handle enough for she uncle ; who take care to propagate it with a indiscretion peculiar to himself ; for I hear it in three different company , before I know any thing of it from herself ; and when I do , it be so repeated , as you , my dear , would hardly have censure she for it , the provocation consider . " " well , but then , dear , there be nothing at all amiss , at this rate , in the correspondence between my lady and you ? " " not on she side , I dare say , if she ladyship can be excuse to punctilio , and for have a greater esteem for a married man , than he can deserve , or than may be strictly defend to a person of you purity and niceness . " " well , , this be very noble in you . I love to hear the gentleman generous in point where the honour of we sex be concerned . but pray . , what then be there on _your_ side , in that matter , that make you give I so patient and so kind a hearing ? " " now , my dear , you come to the point : at first it be nothing in I but vanity , pride , and love of intrigue , to try my strength , where I have meet with some encouragement , as I think , at the masquerade ; where the lady go farther , too , than she would have do , have she not think I be a single man . for , by what I have tell you , , you will observe , that she try to satisfy herself on that head , as soon as she well wcould . acquaint I afterwards , when better know to each other , that she lady be so partial in my favour , ( who can always govern they fancie , my dear ? ) as to think , so early as at the masquerade , that if every thing answer appearance , and that I be a single man , she , who have a noble and independent fortune , might possibly be induced to make I happy in she choice . " Suppose , then , that I be unmarried , she leave a signal for I in she handkerchief . I visit she ; have the honour , after the customary first shyness , of be well receive ; and continue my visit , till , perhaps , she would have be glad I have not be marry , but on finding I be , she avoid I , as I have tell you , till the accident I mention throw we again upon each other : which renew we intimacy upon term you would think too inconsiderable on one side , and too design on the other . " for myself , what can I say ? only that you give I great disgust ( without cause , as I think , ) by you unwonted reception of I , ever in tear and grief ; the Countess ever cheerful and lively ; and fear that you temper be entirely change , I believe I have no bad excuse to try to make myself easy and cheerful abroad , since my home become more irksome to I than ever I believe it could be . then , as we naturally love those who love we , I have vanity , and some reason for my vanity ( indeed all vain man believe they have , ) to think the Countess have more than a indifference for I . she be so exasperate by the wrong method take with a independent lady of she generous spirit , to break off we acquaintance , that , in revenge , she deny I less than ever opportunity of she company . the pleasure we take in each other 's conversation be reciprocal . the world 's report have unite we in one common cause : and you , as I say , have make home less delightful to I than it use to be : what might not then have be apprehend from so many circumstance concurr with the lady 's beauty and my frailty ? " I wait on she to . she take a house there . where people 's tongue will take so much liberty , without any foundation , and where the utmost circumspection be use , what will they not say , where so little of the latter be observe ? no wonder , then , that term be say to be agree upon between we : from she uncle 's story , of polygamy propose by I , and seemingly agree to by she , no wonder that all you 's information be surmise . thus stand the matter , when I be determined to give you cause for uneasiness a hearing , and to take my measure accord to what should result from that hearing . " " from this account , dear , " say I , " it will not be so difficult , as I fear , to end this affair even to she _ladyship 's satisfaction . " --" I hope not , my dear . " --" but if , now , , the Countess should still
still be desirous not to break with you ; from so charme a lady , who know what may happen ! " " very true , ; but to make you still easier , I will tell you that she ladyship have a first cousin marry to a person go with a public character to several of the italian court , and , have it not be for my persuasion , she would have accept of they earnest invitation , and pass a year or two in , where she once reside for three year together , which make she so perfect a mistress of Italian . " now I will let she know , additionally to what I have write to she , the uneasiness I have give you , and , so far as it be proper , what be come to you ear , and you generous account of she , and the charms of she person , of which she will not be a little proud ; for she have really noble and generous sentiment , and think well ( though she sister , in pleasantry , will have it a little enviously , ) of you ; and when I shall endeaavor to persuade she to go , for the sake of she own character , to a place and country of which she be always fond , I be apt to think she will come into it ; for she have a greater opinion of my judgment than it deserfe : and I know a young lord , who may be easily persuade to follow she thither , and bring she back he lady , if he can obtain she consent : and what say you , , to this ? " " o , ! I believe I shall begin to love the lady dearly , and that be what I never think I should . I hope this will be bring about . " but I see , give I leave to say , , how dangerously you might both have go on , under the notion of this Platonic love , till two precious soul have be lose : and this shew one , as well in spiritual as temporal , from what slight beginning the greatest mischief sometimes spring ; and how easily at first a breach may be stop , that , when neglect , the wave of passion will wie till they bear down all before they . " " you observation , my dear , be just , " reply , " and though , I be confident the lady be more in earnest than myself in the notion of Platonic love , yet I be convince , and always be , that Platonic love be Platonic nonsense : ' ti the fly buz about the blaze , till its wing be scorch ; or , to speak still stronger , it be a bait of the to catch the unexperienced , and thoughtless : nor ought such notion to be pretend to , till the party be five or ten year on the other side of they grand climateric : for age , old age , and nothing else , must establish the barrier to Platonic love . but this be my comparative consolation , though a very bad one , that have I swerve , I should not have give the only instance , where person more scrupulous than I pretend to be , have begin friendship even with spiritual view , and end they as grossly as I could have do , be the lady to have be as frail as she tempter . " here finish he narrative . he be now set out for with all my papers . I have no doubt in he honour and kind assurance , and hope my next will be a joyful letter ; and that I shall inform you in it , that the affair which go so near my heart , be absolutely concluded to my satisfaction , to . and the Countess 's ; for if it be so to all three , my happiness , I doubt not , will be found on a permanent basis . meantime I be , my dear good lady , _your most affectionate , and oblige sister and servant , a new misfortune , my dear lady ! -- but this be of 's send ; so I must bear it patiently . my dear baby be take with the small - pox !-- to how many troubles be the happiest of we subject in this life ! one need not multiply they by one 's own wilful mismanagement !-- I be able to mind nothing else ! I have so much joy ( as I tell you ladyship in the beginning of my last letter but one ) to see , on we arrival at the farm - house , my dearest , my beloved baby , and my good parent , all upon one happy spot , that I fear I be too proud -- yet I be truly thankful , I be sure !-- but I have , notwithstand too much pride , and too much pleasure , on this happy occasion . I say , in my last , that you dear brother set out on morning for with my papers ; and I long to know the result , hope that every thing would be conclude to the satisfaction of all three : " for , " think I , " if this be so , my happiness must be permanent : " but alas ! there be nothing permanent in this life . I feel it by experience now !-- I know it before by theory : but that be not so near and interest by half . for , with all my pleasur and hope ; in the midst of
of my dear parent 's joy and congratulation on we arrival , and on what have pass so happily since we be last here together , ( in the birth of the dear child , and my safety , for which they have be so apprehensive , ) the poor baby be take ill . it be on that very Tuesday he papa set out for ; but we know not it would be the small - pox till . of madam ! how be all the pleasure I have form to myself sicken now upon I ! for my be very bad . they talk of a kind sort : but ala : they talk at random : for they come not out at all !-- I fear the nurse 's constitution be too hale and too rich for the dear baby ! --Had _I_ be permit -- but hush , all my repin _if !_--except one _if ; and that be , _if it be get happily over , it will be best he have it so young , and while at the breast !-- oh ! madam , madam ! the small appearance that there be be gone in again : and my child , my dear baby , will die ! the doctor seem to think so . they want to send for to keep I from he ! -- but I forbid it !-- for what signify life , or any thing , if I can not see my baby , while he be so dangerously ill ! my father and mother be , for the first time , quite cruel to I ; they have forbid I , and I never be so desirous of disobey they before , to attend the darling of my heart : and why ?-- for fear of this poor face ! -- for fear I should get it myself ! -- but I be live very low , and have take proper precaution by bleeding , and the like , to lessen the distemper 's fury , if I should have it ; and the rest I leave to . and if . .' value be confine so much to this poor transitory sightliness , he must not break with he Countess , I think ; and if I be ever so deform in person , my poor intellect , I hope will not be impaire , and I shall , if spare my , be useful in he first education , and be helpful to dear -- or to any baby -- with all my heart -- he may make I a humble nurse too !--How peevish , sinfully so , I doubt , do this accident , and they affectionate contradiction , make one ! I have this moment receive the follow from . " my dearest love , " I be greatly touch with the dear boy 's malady , of which I have this moment heard . I desire you instantly to come to I hither , in the chariot with the bearer , . I know what you grief must be : but as you can do the child no good , I beg you will oblige I . everything be in a happy train ; but I can think only of you , and ( for you sake principally , but not a little for _my own ) my boy . I will set out to meet you ; for I choose not to come myself , lest you should try to persuade I to permit you tarry about he ; and I should be sorry to deny you any thing . I have take handsome apartment for you , till the event , which I pray may be happy , shall better determinate I what to do . I will be ever _your affectionate and faithful_. " Maidstone indeed be not so very far off , but one may hear every day , once or twice , by a man and horse ; so I will go , to show my obedience , since be so intent upon it -- but I can not live , if I be not permit to come back -- oh ! let I be enable , gracious Father ! to close this letter more happily than I have begin it ! I have be so dreadfully uneasy at , that . have be so good as to return with I hither ; and I find my baby 's case not yet quite desperate -- I be easier now I see he , in presence of he beloved papa who let I have all my way , and approve of my preparative method for myself ; and he tell I that since I will have it so , he will indulge I in my attendance on the child , and endeavou to imitate my reliance on -- that be he kind expression -- and leave the issue to he . and on my tell he , that I fear nothing in the distemper , but the loss of he love , he say , in presence of the doctor , and my father and mother , press my hand to he lip -- " my dearest life , make yourself easy under this affliction , and apprehend nothing for yourself : I love you more , for you mind than for you face . that and you person will be the same ; and be that sweet face to be cove with seam and scars , I will value you the more for the misfortune : and glad I be , that I have you picture so well draw in town , to satisfy those who have hear of you loveliness , what you be , and hitherto be . for myself , my admiration lie deeper ; " and , draw I to the other end
end of the room , whisperingly he say , " the last uneasiness between we , I now begin to think , be necessary , because it have turn all my delight in you , more than ever , to the perfection of you mind : and so preserve to I the life of my , I care not for my own part , what ravage the distemper make here , " and tap my cheek .-- how generous , how noble , how comforting be this ! when I go from my apartment , to go to my child , my dear meet I at the nursery door , and lead I back again . " you must not go in again , my dearest . they have just be give the child other thing to try to drive out the malady ; and some pustule seem to promise on he breast . " I make no doubt , my baby be then in extremity ; and I would have give the world to have she a few tear , but I could not . with the most soothing goodness he lead I to my desk , and withdraw to attend the dear baby himself -- to see he last gasping , poor little lamb , I make no doubt ! in this suspense , my own strange hardness of heart would not give up one tear , for the passage from that to my _eye see quite choak up , which use to be so open and ready on other occasion , affect one too . two day have pass , dreadful day of suspense : and now , bless be ! who have give I hope that we prayer be hear , the pustule come kindly out , very thick in he breast , and on he face : but of a good sort , they tell I .-- they will not let I see he ; indeed they will not ! -- what cruel kindness be this ! one must believe all they tell one ! but , my dear lady , my spirit be so weak ; I have such a violent headache , and have such a strange shivering disorder all run down my back , and I be so hot just now , and be so cold at this present -- aguishly inclin -- I do not know how ! that I must leave off , the post go away , with the assurance , that I be , and will be , to the last hour of my life , _you ladyship 's grateful and obliged sister and servant , from to ._ my , I take very kindly you solicitude for the health of my beloved Pamela . the last line she write be to you , for she take to she be the moment she lay down she pen . I tell she you kind message , and wish for she safety , by my lord 's gentleman ; and she beg I would write a line to thank you in she name for you affectionate regards to she . she be in a fine way to do well : for with she accustomed prudence , she have begin to prepare herself by a proper regimen , the moment she know the child 's illness be the small - pox . the worst be over with the boy , which keep up she spirit ; and she mother be so excellent a nurse to both , and we be so happy likewise in the care of a skilful physician , ( who direct and approve of every thing the good dame do , ) that it be a singular providence this malady seize they here ; and afford no small comfort to the dear creature herself . when I tell you , that , to all appearance , she charme face will not receive any disfigurement by this cruel enemy to beauty , I be sure you will congratulate I upon a felicity so desirable : but be it to be otherwise , if I be capable of slighte a person , whose principal beautie be much deeper than the skin , I should deserve to be think the most unworthy and superficial of husband . whatever you notions have be , my ever - ready censuring , of you brother , on a certain affair , I do assure you , that I never do , and never can , love any woman as I love my . it be indeed impossible I can ever love she better than I do ; and she outward beautie be far from be indifferent to I ; yet , if I know myself , I be sure I have justice enough to love she _equally , and generosity enough to be _more tender of she , be she to suffer by this distemper . but , as she humility , and she affection to I , would induce she to think herself under greater obligation to I , for such my tenderness to she , be she to lose any the _least valuable of she perfection , I rejoice that she will have no reason for mortification on that score . my respects to , and you noble neighbour . I be , _your affectionate brother , and humble servant . from , in answer to the preceding . my , I do most heartily congratulate you on the recovery of master , and the good way my sister be in . I be the more rejoiced , as she sweet face be not like to suffer by the malady ; for , be the beauty of the mind what they will , those of the person be no small recommendation , with some folk , I be sure ; and I begin to be afraid , that when it be hardly possible
possible for _both conjoined to keep a roving mind constant , that _one only would not be sufficient . this news give I more pleasure , because I be well inform , that a certain gay lady be pleased to give herself air upon learning of my sister 's illness , as , that she would not be sorry for it ; for now she should look upon herself as the prettiest woman in .-- she mean only , I suppose , as to _outward_ prettiness , brother ! you give I the name of a _ready censurer _. I own , I think myself to be not a little interested in all that regard my brother , and he honour . but when some people be not readier to _censure , than other to _trespass , I know not whether they can with justice be style censorious . but however that be , the rod seem to have be hold up , as a warning -- and that the blow , in the irreparable deprivation , be not give , be a mercy , which I hope will be deserve ; though you never can those very signal one you receive at the Divine hand , beyond any man I know . for even ( if I shall not be deem censorious again ) you very vice have be turn to you felicity , as if would try the nobleness of the heart he have give you , by overcome you ( in answer to my sister 's constant prayer , as well as mine ) by mercy rather than by judgment . I might give instance of the truth of this observation , in almost all the action and attempt of you past life ; and take care ( if you _are_ displease , I _will speak it ) , take care , thou bold wretch , that if this method be ungratefully slighte , the uplifted arm fall not down with double weight on thy devote head ! I must always love and honour my brother , but can not help speak my mind : which , after all , be the natural result of that very love and honour , and which oblige I to style myself _your truly affectionate sister , . . from to . my DEAREST Lady , my first letter , and my first devoir , after those of thankfulness to that gracious , who have so happily conduct I through two such heavy trial , as my child 's and my own illness , must be direct to you , with all due acknowledgment of you generous and affectionate concern for I . we be now prepar for we journey to Bedfordshire ; and there , to my great satisfaction , I be to be favour with the care of . after tarry about a month there , . will make a tour with I through several county ( take the in the way ) for about a fortnight , and show I what be remarkable , every where as we pass ; for this , he think , will better contribute to my health , than any other method . the distemper have leave upon I a kind of weariness and listlessness ; and he propose to be out with I till the Bath season begin ; and by the aid of those healing and balsamic water , he hope , I shall be quite establish . afterwards to return to for a little while ; then to ; and then to ; and , if nothing hinder , have a great mind to carry I over to . thus most kindly do he amuse and divert I with he agreeable proposal . but I have make one amendment to they ; and that be , that I must not be deny to pay my respects to you ladyship , at you seat , and to my good Lady Countess in the same neighbourhood , and this will be far from be the least of my pleasure . I have have congratulation without number upon my recovery ; but one , among the rest , I do not expect ; from the ( could you think it , ? ) who send I by she gentleman the follow letter from . " madam , " I hope , among the congratulation of you numerous admirer , on you happy recovery , my very sincere one will not be unacceptable . I have no other motive for make you my compliment on this occasion , on so slender a acquaintance , than the pleasure it give I , that the public , as well as you private friend , have not be deprive of a lady whose example , in every duty of life , be of so much concern to both .-- may you , madam , long rejoice in a uninterrupted state of happiness , answerable to you merit , and to you own wish , be those of _you most obedient humble servant_. " to this kind letter I return the follow : " , " I be under the highest obligation to you generous favour , in you kind compliment of congratulation on my recovery . there be something so noble and so condescende in the honour you have do I , on so slender a acquaintance , that it bespeak the exalted mind and character of a lady , who , in the principle of generosity , and in true nobleness of nature , have no example . bless you , my dear lady , with all the good you wish I , and with increase of honour and glory , both here and hereafter , pray , and will always pray , _you ladyship 's most obliged and obedient servant , " this lead I to mention , what my illness would not permit I to
to do before , that meet with such a reception and audience from the Countess , when he attend she , in all he have to offer and propose to she , and in she patient hear of what he think fit to read she , from you ladyship 's letter and mine , that he say , " do not be jealous , my dear Pamela ; but I must admire she as long as I live . " he give I the particular , so much to she ladyship 's honour , that I tell he , he should not only be welcome to admire she ladyship , but that I would admire she too . they parte very good friend , and with great profession of esteem for each other .-- and as . have undertaken to inspect into some exceptionable account and management of she ladyship 's bailiff , one of she servants bring a letter for he on last , wholly write on that subject . but she be so considerate , as to send it unsealed , in a cover direct to I . when I open it , I be frightened to see it begin to and I hasten to find he -- " dear sir -- here be some mistake -- you see the direction be to Mrs . B .--'Tis very plain -- but , upon my word , I have not read it . " -- " do not be uneasy , my love .-- I know what the subject must be ; but I dare swear there be nothing , nor will there ever be , but what you or any body may see . " he read it , and give it to I , say , " answer yourself the postscript , my dear . " that be -- " if , , the trouble I give you , be likely to subject you or you lady to uneasiness or apprehension , I beg you will not be concerned in it . I will then set about the matter myself ; for my uncle I will not trouble ; yet woman enter into these particular with as little advantage to themselves as inclination . " I tell he , I be entirely easy and unapprehensive ; and , after all he goodness to I , should be so , if he see the Countess every day . " that be kindly say , my dear ; but I will not trust myself to see she every day , or at all , for the present . but I shall be oblige to correspond with she for a month or so , on this occasion ; unless you prohibit it ; and it shall be in you power to do so . " I say , with my whole heart , he might ; and I should be quite easy in both they honour . " yet I will not , " say he , " unless you see we letter : for I know she will always , now she have begin , send in a cover to you , what she will write to I , unsealed ; and whether I be at home or abroad , I shall take it unkindly , if you do not read they . " he go in , and write a answer , which he send by the messenger ; but would make I , whether I would or not , read it , and seal it up with he seal . but all this need not to I now , who think so much better of the lady than I do before ; and be so well satisfied in he own honour and generous affection for I ; for you see , Madam , in what I write before , that he always love I , though he be angry at time , at my change of temper , as he fear , not know that I be apprise of what have pass between he and the Countess . I really be better pleased with he correspondence , than I should have be , have it not be carry on ; because the servants , on both side , will see , by my deportment on the occasion ( and I will officiously , with a smiling countenance , throw myself in they observation ) , that it be quite innocent ; and this may help to silence the mouth of those who have so freely censure they conduct . indeed , Madam , I think I have receive no small good myself by that affair , which once lay so heavy upon I : for I do not believe I shall be ever jealous again ; indeed I do not think I shall . and will not that be a ugly foible overcome ? I see what may be do , in case not favourable to we wish , by the aid of proper reflection ; and that the bee be not the only creature that may make honey out of the bitter flowers as well as the sweet . my most grateful respects and thanks to my good ; to the , and he excellent Countess ; and most particularly to ( with whose kind compliment you ladyship acquaint I ) , and to for all you united congratulation on my recovery . what obligation do I lie under to such noble and generous well - wisher !-- I can make no return but by my prayer , that , by he goodness , will supply all my defect . and these will always attend you , from , my dearest lady , _you ever oblige sister , and humble servant , be just arrive . he say , he come a special messenger , to make a report how my face have come off . he
he make I many compliment upon it . how kind you ladyship be , to enter so favourably into the minutest concern , which you think , may any way affect my future happiness in you dear brother 's opinion !-- I want to pour out all my joy and my thankfulness to , before you , and the good Countess of ---- ! for I be a happy , yea , a bless creature ! .' boy , you ladyship 's boy , and my boy , be charmingly well ; quite strong , and very forward , for he month ; and he papa be delighted with he more and more . my , I hope you be happy and well . you kindly say you can not be so , till you hear of my perfect recovery . and this , bless be ! you have hear already from . as to you intimation of the fair , ' ti all happily over . bless be for that too ! and I have a better and more endearing husband than ever . do you think that could be ? my too improve dailly , and my dear parent seem to have they youth renew like the eagle 's . how many blessing have I to be thankful for ! we be about to turn traveller , to the northern county . I think quite to the border : and afterwards to the western , to , , and I know not whither myself : but among the rest , to Lincolnshire , that you may be sure of . then how happy shall I be in my dear ! I long to hear whether poor be better or worse for the advice of the doctor , whom I order to attend she from , and in what frame she mind be . do vouchsafe she a visit in my name ; tell she , if she be low spirit , what hath do for I , as to _my recovery , and comfort she all you can ; and bid she spare neither expence nor attendance , nor any thing she heart can wish for ; nor the company of any relation or friend she may desire to be with she . if she be in she _last stage , poor soul ! how noble will it be in you to give she comfort and consolation in she die hour ! although we can merit nothing at the hand of , yet I have a notion , that we can not deserve more of one another , and in some sense , for that reason , of he , than in we charity on so try a exigence ! when the poor soul stand shivering , as it be , on the verge of death , and have nothing strong , but it be fear and doubt ; then a little balm pour into the wound of the mind , a little comforting advice to rely on 's mercy , from a good person , how consolatory must it be ! and how , like morning mists before the sun , must all diffidence and gloomy doubt , be chase away by it ! but , my dear , the great occasion of my write to you just now , be by 's desire , on a quite different subject . she know how we love one another . and she have send I the follow line by she kinsman , who come to , purposely to enquire how my face fa in the small - pox ; and accompany we hither , [ _i.e._ to , ] and set out to - morrow for 's .

to any thing a lady should think reasonable . I must tell you another piece of news in the matrimonial way . have be here to congratulate we on we multiplied blessing ; and he acquaint that a overture have be make he by he new patron , of a kinswoman of he lordship 's , a person of virtue and merit , and a fortune of three thousand pound , to make he amend , as the earl tell he , for quit a better living to oblige he ; and that he be in great hope of obtain the lady 's consent , which be all that be want . be much pleased with so good a prospect in 's favour , and be in the lady 's company formerly at a ball , at ; he say , she be prudent and deserve ; and offer to make a journey on purpose to forward it , if he can be of service to he . I suppose you know that all be adjust , accord to the scheme I formerly acquaint you with , between and that gentleman ; and both be settle in they respective living . but I ought to have tell you , that , upon mature deliberation , decline the stipulate eighty pound _per annum from , as he think it would have a simoniacal appearance . but now my hand 's in , let I tell you of a third matrimonial proposition , which give I more puzzle and dislike a great deal . and that be , have , with great reluctance , and after abundance of bashful apology , ask I , if I have any objection to he make he address to ? which , however , he tell I , he have not mention to she , nor to any body live , because he would first know whether I should take it amiss , as she service be so immediately about my person . this unexpected motion much perplex I . be a worthy man . he have now a very good living ; yet just enter upon it ; and , I think , accord to he accustom prudence in other respects , have better have turn himself about first . but that be not the point with I neither . I have a great regard to the function . I think it be as necessary , in order to preserve the respect due to the clergy , that they wife should be nearly , if not quite as unblemished , and as circumspect , as themselves ; and this for the gentleman 's own sake , as well as in the eye of the world : for how shall he pursue he study with comfort to himself , if make uneasy at home ! or how shall he expect he female parishioner will regard he _public_ preach , if he can not have a due influence over the _private conduct of he wife ? I can not say , except in the instance of but be a good sort of body enough so far as I know ; but that be such a blot in the poor girl 's escutcheon , a thing not _accidental , nor _surprise into , not owe to _inattention , but to cool _premeditation , that , I think , I could wish a wife more unexceptionable . ' tTis true , know not this , but _that be one of my difficulty . if I acquaint he with it , I shall hurt the poor girl irreparably , and deprive she of a husband , to whom she may possibly make a good wife -- for she be not very meanly descende -- much better than myself , as the world would say be a judgment to be make from my father 's low estate , when I be exalt -- I never , my dear , shall be asham of these retrospection ! she be genteel , have a very innocent look , a good face , be neat in she person , and not addict to any excess that I know of . but _still , that one _premeditate fault , be so sad a one , though she might make a good wife for any middling man of business , yet she want , methinks , that discretion , that purity , which I would always have in the wife of a good clergyman . then , she have not apply she thought to that sort of economy , which the wife of a country clergyman ought to know something of ; and have such a turn to dress and appearance , that I can see , if indulge , she would not be one that would help to remove the scandal which some severe remarker be apt to throw upon the wife of _parson , as they call they . the maiden , I believe , like not a little . she be very courteous to every body , but most to he of any body , and never have miss be present at we 's duty ; and five or six time , tell I , she have find she desirous to have expound this text , and that difficulty ; and the good man be take with she piety , which , and she reformation , I hope , be sincere ; but she be very sly , very subtle , as I have find in several instance , as foolish as she be in the affair I hint at . " so , " sometimes I say to myself , " the girl may love . " --" ay , " but then I answer , " so she do and on he own very bad term too . " -- in short -- but I will not be too censorious neither .
. so I will say no more , than that I be perplex ; and yet should be very glad to have Polly well marry ; for , since that time , I have always have some diffidence about she -- because , you know , -- she fault be so enormous , and , as I have say , so premeditate . I want you to advise with . --but this be the method I take .-- I appoint to drink a dish of tea with I . Polly attend , as usual ; for I can not say I love man attendant in these womanly office . a tea - kettle in a man 's hand , that would , if there be no better employment for he , be fitter to hold a plough , or handle a flail , or a scythey , have such a look with it !-- this be like my low breeding , some would say , perhaps , -- but I can not call thing polite , that I think unseemly ; and , moreover . lady Davers keep I in countenance in this my notion ; and who doubt she politeness ? well , but Polly attend , as I say ; and there be strange simpering , and bow , and curt'sy , between they ; the honest gentleman seem not to know how to let he mistress wait upon he ; while she behave with as much respect and officiousness , as if she could not do too much for he . " very well , " think I , " I have such a opinion of you veracity , , that I dare say you have not mention the matter to ; but between she officiousness , and you mutual simpering and complaisance , I see you have find a language between you , that be full as significant as plain English word . Polly , " think I , " see no difficulty in _this_ text ; nor need you , , have much trouble to make she understand you , when you come to expound upon _this subject . " I be force , in short , to put on a statelier and more reserve appearance than usual , to make they avoid act of complaisance for one another , that might not be proper to be shew before I , for one who sit as my companion , to my servant . when she withdraw , the modest gentleman hem , and look on one side , and turn to the right and leave , as if he seat be uneasy to he , and , I see , know not how to speak ; so I begin in mere compassion to he , and say -- " , I have be think of what you mention to I , as to . " " hey ! hey ! " say he ; and pull out he handkerchief , and wip he mouth -- " very well . madam ; I hope no offence , madam ! " " no , , none at all . but I be at a loss how to distinguish in this case ; whether it may not be from a motive of too humble gratitude , that you do not think yourself above match with , as you may suppose she a favourite of mine ; or whether it be you value for she person and quality , that make she more agreeable in you eye , than any other person would be . " " madam -- madam , " say the bashful gentleman , hesitatingly -- " I do -- I must need say -- I can not but own -- that -- . -- be a person - whom I think very agreeable ; and no less modest and virtuous . " " you know , , you own circumstance . to be sure you have a very pretty house , and a good living , to carry a wife to . and a gentleman of you prudence and discretion want 's not any advice ; but you have reap no benefit by you living . it have be a expence to you rather , which you will not presently get up : do you propose a early marriage , ? or be it not better to suspend you intentions of that sort for a year or two more ? " --" Madam , if you ladyship choose not to part with --" -- " Nay , , " interrupt I , " I say not any thing for my own sake in this point : that be out of the question with I . I can very willingly part with , be it to - morrow , for she good and yours . " --" madam , I humbly beg pardon ; -- but --but --delays may breed dangers . " --" oh I very well , " think I ; " if the artful girl have not let he know , by some means or other , that she have another humble servant . " and so , , it have prove -- for , dismiss my gentleman , with assure he , that I have no objection at all to the matter , or to part with , as soon as it suit with they conveniency -- I sound she , and ask , if she think have any affection for she ?-- she say he be a very good gentleman . " I know it , Polly ; and be you not of opinion he love you a little ? " --" dear ma 'am -- love I -- I do not know what such a gentleman as should see in I , to love I ! " --" oh ! " think I , " do the doubt lie on _that
_that side then ?-- I see ' tis not of _thine _. " " well , but , Polly , if you have _another_ sweetheart , you should do the fair thing ; it would be wrong , if you encourage any body else , if you think of . " --" indeed , , I have a letter send I -- a letter that I receive -- from -- from a young man in ; but I never answer it . " " oh ! " think I , " then thou wouldst not encourage _two at once ; " and this be as plain a declaration as I want , that she have thought of . " but how come , , to know of this letter ? " --" how come he to know of it , ! " --repeate she -- half surprised -- " why , I do not know , I can not tell how it be -- but I drop it near he desk -- pull out my handkerchief , I believe , , and he bring it , and give it I again . " -- " well , " think I , " thou 'rt a intriguing slut , I doubt , . " --" _Delays may breed dangers , " quoth the poor gentleman !-- " ah ! girl , girl ! " think I , but do not say so , " thou deservest to have thy plot spoiled , that thou dost -- but if thy forwardness should expose thee afterwards to evils which thou mayest avoid if thy scheme take place , I should very much blame myself . and I see he love thee -- So let the matter take its course ; I will trouble myself no more about it . I only wish , that thou will make as good a wife as he deserve . " and so I dismiss she , tell she , that whoever think of be a clergyman 's wife , should resolve to be as good as himself ; to set a example to all she sex in the parish , and show how much he doctrine have weight with she ; should be humble , circumspect , gentle in she temper and manners , frugal , not proud , nor vy in dress with the ladie of the laity ; should resolve to sweeten he labour , and to be oblige in she deportment to poor as well as rich , that she husband get no discredit through she means , which would weaken he influence upon he auditor ; and that she must be most of all oblige to he , and study he temper , that he mind might be more disengaged , in order to pursue he study with the better effect . and so much for _you humble servant ; and for 's and 's matrimonial prospect ;-- and do not think I so disrespectful , that I have mention my 's affair in the same letter with yours . for in high and low ( I forget the phrase -- I have not have a lesson a long , long while , from my dear tutor ) love be in all the same ! -- but whether you will like as well as Polly do , that be the question . but , leave that to you own decision , I conclude with one observation ; that , although I think we 's be a house of as little intriguing as any body 's , since the dear master of it have leave off that practice , yet I can not see , that any family can be clear of some of it long together , where there be man and woman worth plott for , as husband and wife . my best wish and respects attend all you worthy neighbour . I hope ere long , to assure they , severally ( to wit , , my lady , , , and he lady and niece , whose kind congratulation make I very proud , and very thankful ) how much I be oblige to they ; and particularly , my dear , how much I be _your ever affectionate and faithful friend and servant , . , from , in answer to the preceding ._ my , I have be several time ( in company with ) to see . the poor woman be very bad , and can not live many day . we comfort she all we can ; but she often accuse herself of she past behaviour to so excellent a lady ; and with blessing upon blessing , heape upon you , and she master , and you charme little boy , be continually declare how much you goodness to she aggravate she former fault to she own conscience . she have a sister - in - law and she niece with she , and have settle all she affair , and think she be not long for this world . -- she distemper be a inward decay , all at once as it be , from a constitution that seem like one of iron ; and she be a mere skeleton : you would not know she , I dare say . I will see she every day ; and she have give I up all she key , and account , to give to , who be daily expect , and I hope will be here soon ; for she sister - in - law , she say herself , be a woman of _this world , as _she have be . call upon I to go with he to visit she , I will break off here . be much as she be ; but you faithful steward be come . I be glad of it -- and so be she -- nevertheless I
I will go every day , and do all the good I can for the poor woman , accord to you charitable desire . I thank you for you communication of 's letter , I be much oblige to my lord , and she ladyship ; and should have be proud of a alliance with that noble family , but with all . good quality , as my lady paint they out , and he other advantage , I could not , for the world , make he my husband . I will tell you one of my objection , in confidence , however , ( for you be only to _sound I , you know :) and I would not have it mention that I have take any thought about the matter , because a stronger reason may be give , such a one as my lord and lady will both allow ; which I will communicate to you by and bye .-- my objection arise even from what you intimate , of . good humour , and he persuadableness , if I may so call it . now , be I of a boisterous temper , and high spirit , such a one have require great patience in a husband to bear with I , then . good humour might have be a consideration with I . but when I have ( I pride myself in the thought ) a temper not wholly unlike you own , and such a one as would not want to contend for superiority with a husband , it be no recommendation to I , that be a good - humoured gentleman , and will bear with fault I design not to be guilty of . but , my dear , my husband must be a man of sense , and give I reason to think he have a superior judgment to my own , or I shall be unhappy . he will otherwise do wrong - head thing : I shall be force to oppose he in they : he will be tenacious and obstinate , be teach to talk of prerogative , and to call himself a _man , without know how to behave as one , and I to despise he , of course ; so be deem a bad wife , when , I hope , I have qualitie that would make I a tolerable good one , with a man of sense for my husband . now you must not think I would dispense with real good - humour in a man . no , I make it one of my _indispensables_ in a husband . a good - natured man will put the best construction on what happen ; but he must have sense to _distinguish the best . he will be kind to little , unwilful , undesigned failings : but he must have judgment to distinguish what _are or be not so _. but .' good - humour be softness , as I may call it ; and my husband must be such a one , in short , as I need not be asham to be see with in company ; one who , be my head , must not be beneath all the gentleman he may happen to fall in , and who , every time he be adjust he mouth for speech , will give I pain at my heart , and blush in my face , even before he speak . I could not bear , therefore , that every one we encounter should be prepare , whenever he offer to open he lip , by they contemptuous smile , to expect some weak and silly thing from he ; and when he _had_ speak , that he should , with a booby grin , seem please that he have not disappoint they . the only recommendatory point in be , that he dress exceedingly smart , and be no contemptible figure of a man . but , dear madam , you know , that be so much the worse , _when_ the man 's talent be not taciturnity , except before he aunt , or before . or you ; _when_ he be not conscious of internal defect , and value himself upon outward appearance . as to he attempt upon you Polly , though I do not like he the better for it , yet it be a fault so wickedly common among man , that when a woman resolve never to marry , till a quite virtuous man address she , it be , in other word , resolve to die single ; so that I make not this the _chief objection ; and yet , I would abate in my expectation of half a dozen other good quality , rather than that one of virtue in a husband -- but when I reflect upon the figure make in that affair , I can not bear he ; and , if I may judge of other coxcomb by he , what wretch be these smart , well - dress querpo fellow , many of whom you and I have see admir themselves at the play and operas ! this be one of my infallible rule , and I know it be yours too ; that he who be take up with the admiration of he own person , will never admire a wife 's . he delights be cent in himself , and he will not wish to get out of that exceed narrow circle ; and , in my opinion , should keep no company but that of taylor , wig - puffer , and milliner . but I will run on no further upon this subject ; but will tell you a reason , which you _may give to , why she kind intention to I can not be answer ; and which she will take better
better than what I _have say , be she to know it , as I hope you will not let she : and this be , my papa have have a proposal make to he from a gentleman you have see , and have think polite . it be from of this county , who be one of you great admirer , and .' too ; and that , you must suppose , make I have never the worse opinion of he , or of he understanding ; although it require no great sagacity or penetration to see how much you adorn we sex , and human nature too . every thing be adjust between my papa and mamma , and , on condition we approve of each other , before I come down ; which I know not , till I have see he here four time ; and then my papa surprise I into half a approbation of he : and this , it seem , be one of the reason why I be so hurrie down from you . I can not say , but I like the man as well as most I have see ; he be a man of sense and sobriety , to give he he due , in very easy circumstance , and much respect by all who know he ; which be no bad earnest in a marriage prospect . but , hithertoo , he seem to like I better than I do he . I do not know how it be ; but I often observe , that when any thing be in we power , we be not half so much take with it , as we should be , perhaps , if we be keep in suspense ! why should this be ?--But this I be convinced of , there be no comparison between and . now I have name this brother - in - law of mine ; what do you think ?-- why , that good couple have have they house on fire three time already . once it be put out by 's mother , who live near they ; and twice have be force to carry water to extinguish it ; for , truly , Murray would go home again to she papa ; she would not live with such a surly wretch : and it be with all he heart ; a fair riddance ! for there be no bear the house with such a ill - natured wife :-- she sister be worth a thousand of she !-- I be heartily sorry for they unhappiness . but could she think every body must bear with she , and she fretful way ?-- they will jangle on , I reckon , till they be better use to one another ; and when he see she can not help it , why he will bear with she , as husband generally do with ill - tempere wife ; he will try to make himself happy abroad , and leave she to quarrel with she maid , instead of he ; for she must have somebody to vent she spleen upon -- poor !-- I be glad to hear off 's good fortune . as know not 's fault , and it be prevent in time , they may be happy enough . she be a _sly girl . I always think she so : something so innocent , and yet so artful in she very look : she be a odd compound . but these worthy and piously turn young gentleman , who have but just quit the college , be mere novice , as to the world : indeed they be _above_ it , while _in_ it ; they therefore give themselves little trouble to study it , and so , depend on the goodness of they own heart , be more liable to be impos upon than people of half they understanding . I think , since he seem to love she , you do right not to hinder the girl 's fortune . but I wish she may take you advice , in she behaviour to _he _, at least : for as to she carriage to she neighbour , I doubt she will be one of the head of the parish , presently , in she own estimation . ' tTis pity , methinks , any worthy man of the cloth should have a wife , who , by she bad example , should pull down , as fast as he , by a good one , can build up . this be not the case of , however ; whose example I wish be more generally follow by gentlewoman , who be make so by marry good clergyman , if they be not so before . do not be surprised , if you should hear that poor be give over !-- she make a very exemplary -- full of blessing -- and more easy and resign , than I apprehend she would be . I know you will she a tear for the poor woman :-- I can not help it myself . but you will be please that she have so much time give she , and make so good use of it . have be every thing that one would wish one of he function to be , in he attendance and advice to the poor woman . will take proper care of every thing . so , I will only add , that I be , with the sincerest respect , in hope to see you soon ( for I have a multitude of thing to talk to you about ) , dear , _your ever faithful and affectionate_ Polly Darnford . from to ._ my , I understand from , that before she go down from we , she papa have encourage a proposal make by
by whom you see , when you ladyship be a kind visitor in . we all agree , if you remember , that he be a polite and sensible gentleman , and I find it be countenance on all hand . poor , , as inform I , have pay she last debt . I hope , through mercy , she be happy !-- poor , poor woman ! but why say I so !-- since , in _that case , she will be richer than a earthly monarch ! you ladyship be once mention a sister of 's whom you wish to recommend to some worthy family . shall I beg of you . Madam , to oblige . in this particular ? I be sure she must have merit if you ladyship think well of she ; and you command in this , as well as in every other particular in my power , shall have they due weight with _you ladyship 's obliged sister and humble servant , P.B. just now , dear madam , . tell I I shall have bring I hither to - morrow . from to in answer to the preceding ._ my , I be glad be likely to be so happy in a husband , as will certainly make she . I be afraid that my proposal would not do with she , have she not have so good a tender . I want _too_ , to have the foolish fellow marry -- for several reason ; one of which be , he be continually tease we to permit he to go up to town , and reside there for some month , in order that he may _see the world , as he call it . but we be convince he would _feel_ it , as well as _see_ it , if we give way to he request : for in understanding , dress , and inconsiderate vanity , he be so exactly cut out and size for a town fop , coxcomb , or pretty fellow , that he will undoubtedly fall into all the vice of those people ; and , perhaps , have such expectation as he have , will be make the property of rake and sharper . he complain that we use he like a child in a go - cart , or a baby with leading - string , and that he must not be trust out of we sight . ' tTis a sad thing , that these _body will grow up to the stature of man , when the _mind improve not at all with they , but be still those of boy and child . yet , he would certainly make a fond husband : for he have no very bad quality . but be such a Narcissus ! -- but this between ourselves , for he uncle be wrapt up in the fellow -- and why ? because he be good - humour , that be all . he have vex I lately , which make I write so angrily about he -- but ' tis not worth trouble you with the particular . I hope be happy , as you say ! -- poor woman ! she seem to promise for a longer life ! but what shall we say ? you compliment to I , about my 's sister , be a very kind one . be a sober , grave widow , a little aforehand , in the world , but not much ; have liv well ; understand house - hold management thoroughly ; be diligent ; and have a turn to serious thing , which will make you like she the better . I will order and she to wait on you , and she will satisfy you in every thing as to what you may , or may not expect of she . you can not think how kindly I take this motion from you . you forget nothing that can oblige you friend . little do I think you would remember I of ( what I have forget in a manner ) my favourable opinion and wish for she express so long ago . -- but you be what you be -- a dear oblige creature . be all joy and gratitude upon it , and she sister have rather serve you than the princess . you need be under no difficulty about term : she would serve you for nothing , if you would accept of she service . I be glad , because it please you so much , that will be soon put into you care . it will be happy for the child , and I hope she will be so dutiful as to give you no pain for you generous goodness to she . she mamma have send I a present of some choice product of that climate , with acknowledgment of my kindness to . I will send part of it to you by you new servant ; for so I presume to call she already . what a naughty sister be you , however , to be so far advanc again as to be oblige to shorten you intend excursion , and yet not to send I word of it yourself ? do not you know how much I interest myself in every thing that make for my brother 's happiness and you ' ? more especially in so material a point as be the increase of a family that it be my boast to be spring from . yet I must find this out by accident , and by other hand !-- be not this very slighting ! -- but never do so again , and I will forgive you now because of the joy it give I ; who be _you truly affectionate and oblige sister , benefit . Daver . I thank you for
for you book upon the play you see . Inclose be a list of some other , which I desire you to read , and to oblige I with you remark upon they at you leisure ; though you may not , perhaps , have see they by the time you will favour I with you observation . from to . my , I have a valuable present make I by the same lady ; and therefore hope you will not take it amiss , that , with abundance of thanks , I return you be by , whose sister I much approve of , and thank you ladyship for you kind recommendation of so worthy a person . we begin with so much good liking to one another , that I doubt not we shall be very happy together . a move letter , much more valuable to I than the handsome present , be put into my hand , at the same time with that ; of which the follow be a copy : from ( formerly ) to b._ " happy , , , " permit these line to kiss you hand from one , who , though she be a stranger to you person , be not so to you character : _that have reach we here , in this remote part of the world , where you have as many admirer as have heard of you . but I more particularly be bound to be so , by a obligation which I can never discharge , but by my daily prayer for you , and the blessing I continually implore upon you and yours . " I can write my whole mind _to_ you , though I cannot , from the most deplorable infelicity , receive _from you the wish - for favour of a few line in return , write with the same unreservedness : so unhappy be I , from the effect of a inconsideration and weakness on one hand , and temptation on the other , which you , at a tender age , most nobly , for you own honour , and that of you sex , have escape : whilst I -- but let my tear in these blot speak the rest -- as my heart bleed , and have constantly b ever since , at the grievous remembrance -- but believe , however , dear Madam , that ' ttis shame and sorrow , and not pride and impenitence , that make I both to speak out , to so much purity of life and manners , my own odious weakness . " Nevertheless , I ink , and I _will_ accuse myself by name . imagine then , illustrious lady , truly illustrious for virtue , infinitely superior to all the advantages of birth and fortune !-- imagine , I say , that in this letter , you see before you the _once_ guilty , and therefore , I doubt , _always guilty , but _ever penitent , ; the unhappy , though fond and tender mother of the poor infant , to whom you generous goodness have , I hear , extend itself , so as to make you desirous of take she under you worthy protection : for ever bless you for it ! pray a indulgent mother , who admire at a awful distance , that virtue in you , which she could not practise herself . " and will you , dearest lady , take under you own immediate protection , the poor unguilty infant ? will you love she , for the sake of she suffering mamma , whom you know not ; for the sake of the gentleman , now so dear to you , and so worthy of you , as I hear , with pleasure , he be ? and will you , by the best example in the world , give I a moral assurance , that she will never sink into the fault , the weakness , the crime ( I ought not to scruple to call it so ) of she poor inconsiderate - but you be she mamma _now _: I will not think of a _guilty one therefore . what a joy be it to I , in the midst of my heavy reflection on my past misconduct , that my belove Sally can boast a _virtuous and _innocent mamma_ , who have withstand the snare and temptation , that have be so fatal -- elsewhere !-- and whose example , and instruction , next to 's , will be the strongest fence to she honour !-- once more I say , and on my knee I write it , for ever bless you here , and augment you joy hereafter , for you generous goodness to my poor , and , till now , _motherless infant . " I hope she , by she duty and obligingness , will do all in she little power to make you amend , and never give you cause to repent of this you _unexampled_ kindness to she and to _me _. she can not , I hope ( except she mother 's crime have have a influence upon she , too much like that of a original stain ) , be of a sordid , or a ungrateful nature . and , of my poor ! if you _are , and if ever you fail in you duty to you new mamma , to whose care and authority I transfer my _whole right in you , remember that you have no more a mamma in I , nor can you be entitled to my blessing , or my prayer , which I make now , on that _only condition , you implicit obedience to all you new mamma 's command and direction . " you may have the curiosity , Madam , to wish to know how I
I live : for no doubt you have hear all my sad , sad story ! -- know , then , that I be as happy , as a poor creature can be , who have once so deplorably , so inexcusably fall . I have a worthy gentleman for my husband , who marry I as a widow , whose only child by my former be the care of she papa 's friend , particularly of good Lacy Davers and she brother . poor unhappy I ! to be under such a sad necessity to disguise the truth !-- ( whose name I be unworthily honoure by ) have often entreate I to send for the poor child , and to let she be join as he -- kill thought , that it can not be !-- with two child I have by he !-- judge , my good lady , how that very generosity , which , have I be guiltless , would have add to my joy , must wound I deeper than even ungenerous or unkind usage from he could do ! and how heavy that crime must lie upon I , which turn my very pleasur to misery , and fix all the joy I _can_ know , in repentance for my past misdeed !-- how happy be you , Madam , on the contrary ; you , who have nothing of this sort to pall , nothing to mingle with you felicity ! who , bless in a honour untainted , and a conscience that can not reproach you , be enable to enjoy every well deserve comfort , as it offer itself ; and can _improve_ it too , by reflection on _you past conduct ! while _mine , alas ! like a winter frost , nips in the bud every rise satisfaction . " my husband be rich as well as generous , and very tender of I -- happy , if I could think _myself as deserve as _he_ think I !-- my principal comfort , as I hint , be in my penitence for my past fault ; and that I have a merciful for my judge , who know that penitence to be sincere ! " you may guess , madam , from what I have say , in what light I _must appear here ; and if you would favour I with a line or two , in answer to the letter you have now in you hand , it will be one of the greatest pleasure I can_ receive : a pleasure next to that which I _have receive in know , that the gentleman you love best , have have the grace to repent of all he evils ; have early see he error ; and have thereby , I hope , freed two_ person from being , one day , mutual accuser of each other ; for now I please myself to think , that the crime of both may be wash away in the blood of that saviour , whom both have so grievously offended ! " May that , who have not suffer I to be abandon entirely to my own shame , as I deserv , continue to shower down upon you those blessing , which a virtue like yours may expect from he mercy ! may you long be happy in the possession of all you wish ! and late , very late ( for the good of thousand , I wish this ! ) may you receive the reward of you piety , you generosity , and you filial , you social , and conjugal virtue ! be the prayer of _you most unworthy admirer , and oblige humble servant , " .

" to this letter , my dear Lady Davers , I have write the follow answer , which . will take care to have convey to she . " , " I embrace with great pleasure the opportunity you have so kindly give I , of writing to a lady whose person though I have not the honour to know , yet whose character , and noble quality , I truly revere . " I be infinitely oblige to you . madam , for the precious trust you have repose in I , and the right you make over to I , of you maternal interest in a child , on whom I set my heart , the moment I see she . " Lady Davers , whose love and tenderness for , as well for she mamma 's sake , as you late worthy spouse 's , have , from she kind opinion of I , consent to grant I this favour : and I be , by . leave , in actual possession of my pretty ward about a week before you kind letter come to my hand . " as I have be long very solicitous for this favour , judge how welcome you kind concurrence be : and the rather , as , have I know , that a letter from you be on the way to I , I should have fear you would insist upon deprive the survive friend of she dear papa , of the pleasure they take in the dear child . indeed , Madam , I believe we should one and all have join to disobey you , have _that be the case ; and it be a great satisfaction to
to we , that we be not under so hard a necessity , as to dispute with a tender mamma the possession of she own child . " assure yourself , worthiest madam , of a care and tenderness in I to the dear child truly maternal , and answerable , as much as in my power , to the trust you repose in I . the little boy , that have give I , shall not be more dear to I than my sweet shall be ; and my care , by 's , shall extend to she _future_ as well as to she _present_ prospect , that she may be worthy of that piety , and _truly religious excellence , which I admire in you character . " we all rejoice , dear madam , in the account you give of you present happiness . it be impossible that should desert a lady so exemplarily deserve ; and he certainly conduct you in you resolution to abandon every thing that you love in , after the loss of you dear spouse , because it seem to have be he intention that you should reward the merit of , and meet with you own reward in so do . " miss be very fond of my little : she be a charming child , be easy and genteel in she shape , and very pretty ; she dance finely , have a sweet air , and be improve every day in music ; work with she needle , and read admirably for she year ; and take a delight in both , which give I no small pleasure . but she be not very forward in she penmanship , as you will see by what follow : the inditing too be she own ; but in that , and the writing , she take a good deal of time , on a separate paper . " , " you be full of joy , to have any command from she honoured mamma . I promise to follow all you direction . indeed , and upon my word , I will . you please I mightily in give I so dear a new mamma here . now I know indeed I have a mamma , and I will love and obey she , as if she be you you own self . indeed I will . you must always bless I , because I will be always good . I hope you will believe I , because I be above tell fib . I be , my honoure mamma on the other side of the water , and ever will be , as if you be here , _you dutiful daughter , " . " " miss ( permit I , dear Madam , to subjoin ) be a very good tempered child , easy to be persuade , and I hope love I dearly ; and I will endeaavor to make she love I better and better ; for on that love will depend the regard which , I hope , she will pay to all I shall say and do for she good . " repeat my acknowledgement for the kind trust you repose in I , and with thanks for the valuable present you have send I , we all here join in respects to worthy , and in wish you . Madam , a continuance and increase of worldly felicity ; and I particularly beg leave to assure you , that I be , and ever will be , with the highest respect and gratitude , though personally unknown , dearest Madam , _to affectionate admirer of you piety , and you oblige humble servant_ , " . " you ladyship will see how I be circumscribe and limit ; otherwise I would have say ( what I have mention more than once ) , how I admire and honour she for she penitence , and for that noble resolution , which enable she to do what thousand could not have have the heart to do , abandon she country , she relation , friend , baby , and all that be dear to she , as well as the seducer , whom she too well love , and hazard the sea , the dangers of pirate , and possibly of other wicked attempter of the mischievous sex , in a world she know nothing of , among stranger ; and all to avoid repeat a sin she have be unhappily draw into ; and for which she still abhor herself . must not such a lady as this , dear madam , have as much merit as many even of those , who , have not have she temptation , have not fall ? this , at least , one may aver , that next to not commit a error , be the resolution to retrieve it all that one may , to repent of it , and studiously to avoid the repetition . but who , besides this excellent , have so fallen , and be still so ardently solicite and pursue , ( and flatter , perhaps , by fond hope , that she spoiler would one day do she all the justice he _could _-- for who can do complete justice to a woman he have rob of she honour ?) --could resolve as she resolve , and act as she act ? be a sweet child ; but , permit I to say , have a little of she papa 's spirit ; hasty , yet generous and acknowledge when she be convinced of she fault ; a little haughtier and prouder than I wish she to be ; but in every thing else deserve the character I give of she to she mamma . she be very fond of fine clothes , be a little too lively to the servant .--
.-- tell I once , when I take notice that softness and mildness of speech become a young lady , that they be _but servants ! and she could say no more than , " pray , " and " I desire , " and " I wish you would be so kind , " to she uncle or to I . I tell she , that good servants deserve any civil distinctions ; and that so long as they be ready to oblige in every thing , by a kind word , it would be very wrong to give they imperative one , which could serve for no other end but to convince observer of the haughtiness of one 's own temper ; and look , as if one would question they compliance with we will , unless we would exact it with a high hand ; which might cast a slur upon the command we give , as if we think it be hardly so reasonable as otherwise to obtain they observation of it . " , my dear , " say I , " you do not consider , that if you speak as haughtily and commandingly to they on common , as on extraordinary occasion , you weaken you own authority , if even you should be permit to have any , and they will regard you no more in the one case than in the other . " she take great notice of what I say , and when she little proud heart be subdue by reasoning she can not answer , she will sit as if she be study what to say , to come off as fly as she can , and as the case require , I let she go off easily , or push the little dear to she last refuge , and make she quit she post , and yield up she spirit a captive to and discretion : two excellent commander , with whom , I tell she , I must bring she to be intimately acquaint . yet , after all , till I can be sure that I can inspire she with the love of virtue , for its _own_ sake , I will rather try to conduct she spirit to proper end , than endeavou totally to subdue it ; be sensible that we passion be give we for excellent end , and that they may , by a proper direction , be make subservient to the noblest purpose . I tell she sometimes , there may be a decent pride in humility , and that it be very possible for a young lady to behave with so much _true_ dignity , as shall command respect by the turn of she eye , sooner than by asperity of speech ; that she may depend upon it , the person , who be always finding fault , frequently cause they ; and that it be no glory to be better bear than servants , if she be not better behave too . besides , I tell she humility be a grace that shine in a _high condition , but can not equally in a _low one ; because that be already too much humble , perhaps : and that , though there be a censure lie against be _poor and proud _, yet I would rather forgive pride in a poor body , than in a rich : for in the rich it be insult and arrogance , proceed from they high condition ; but in the poor it may be a defensative against dishonesty , and may show a natural bravery of mind , perhaps , if properly direct , and manifest on right occasion , that the frown of fortune can not depress . she say she hear every day thing from I , which she governess never teach she . that may very well be , I tell she , because she governess have _many_ young lady to take care of : I but _one ; and that I want to make she wise and prudent betime , that she may be a example to other Misse ; and that governess and mamma shall say to they Misse , " when will you be like ? do you ever hear say a naughty word ? would , think you , have do so or so ? " she throw she arm about my neck , on one such occasion as this ; " oh , " say she , " what a charme mamma have I get ! I will be in every thing as like you , as ever I can !-- and then you will love I , and so will my uncle , and so will every body else . " whom now - and - then , she say , she love as well as if he be she own papa , see with pleasure how we go on . but she tell I , I must not have any daughter but she , and be very jealous on the occasion about which you ladyship so kindly reproach I . there be a pride , you know , , in some of we sex , that serve to useful purpose , be a good defence against improper match , and mean action ; and be not wholly to be subdue , for that reason ; for , though it be not _virtue , yet , if it can be virtue 's _substitute_ , in high , rash , and inconsiderate mind , it ; may turn to good account . so I will not quite discourage my dear pupil neither , till I see what discretion , and riper year , may add to she distinguishing faculty . for , as some have no notion of pride , separate from imperiousness and arrogance , so other know no difference between humility
humility and meanness . there be a golden mean in every thing ; and if it please to spare we both , I will endeaavor to point she passion , and such even of those foible , which seem too deeply root to be soon eradicate , to useful purpose ; choose to imitate physician , who , in certain chronical illness , as I have read in , rather proceed by palliative , than by harsh extirpative , which , through the resistance give to they by the constitution , may create such ferment in it , as may destroy that health it be they intention to establish . but whither am I run ? -- you ladyship , I hope , will excuse this parading freedom of my pen : for though these notion be well enough with regard to , they must be very impertinent to a lady , who can so much better instruct 's tutoress than that vain tutoress can she pupil . and , therefore , with my humblest respects to my good , and you noble neighbour , and to . I hasten to conclude myself _you ladyship 's obliged sister , and obedient servant , P.b. you , , be a charming dear !-- I long to have you see he . he send you a kiss upon this paper . you will see it stain , just here . the charmer have cut two tooth , and be about more : so you will excuse the dear , pretty , slabber boy . be ready to eat he with love : and be fonder and fonder of we all : and then you ladyship , and my good Davers love we too . o , , what a bless creature am I ! beg I will send she duty to she _noble uncle and aunt ; that be she just distinction always , when she speak of you both . she ask I , pretty dear , just now , if I think there be such a happy girl in the world as she be ? I tell she , always bless good Misse , and make they happier and happier . my , I have three marriage to acquaint you with , in one letter . in the first place , have send , by the particular desire of my dear friend , that he be make one of the happiest man in , on the 18th past ; and so I have no longer my to boast off . I have a very good opinion of the gentleman ; but if he be but half so good a husband as she will make a wife , they will be exceedingly happy in one another . 's marriage to a kinswoman of he noble patron ( as you have hear be in treaty ) be the next ; and there be great reason to believe , from the character of both , that they will likewise do credit to the state . the third be and ; and I wish they , for both they sake , as happy as either of the former . they be set out to he living , highly pleased with one another ; and I hope will have reason to continue so to be . as to the first , I do not indeed think the affair would have be so soon conclude ; and keep it off so long , as I understand , that she papa be angry with she : and , indeed , as the gentleman 's family , circumstance , and character , be such , that there could lie no objection against he , I think it would have be wrong to have delay it . I should have write to you ladyship before ; but have be favour with . company into , on a visit to my good mother , who be indispose . we tarry there a week , and leave both my dear parent , to my thankful satisfaction , in as good health as ever they be in they life . , or ( as she refuse not be call , now and then ) , have be with we for this week past ; and she expect she brother , , to fetch she away in about a week hence . it do not become I to write the least word that may appear disrespectful of any person related to you ladyship and . otherwise I should say , that the benefit --- - s and the s --- - s be directly the opposite of one another . but yet , as she never see you ladyship but once , you will forgive I to mention a word or two about she , because she be a character that be in a manner new to I . she be a maiden lady , as you know , and though she will not part with the green leaf from she hand , one see by the grey - goose down on she brows and she head , that she can not be less than fifty - five . but so much pain do she take , by powder , to have never a dark hair in she head , because she have one half of they white , that I be sorry to see , what be a subject for reverence , should be deem , by the good lady , matter of concealment . she be often seemingly reproach herself , that she be a _old maid , and a _old woman ; but it be very discernible , that she expect a compliment , that she be not so , every time she be so free with herself : and if nobody make she one , she will say something of that sort in she own behalf . she take particular
particular care , that of all the public transaction which happen to be talk of , she memory will never carry she back above thirty year ! and then it be -- " about thirty year ago ; when I be a girl , " or " when I be in hanging sleeve ; " and so she make herself , for twenty year of she life , a very useless and insignificant person . if she tooth , which , for she age , be very good , though not over white ( and which , by she care of they , she seem to look upon as the last remains of she better day ) , would but fail , it might help she to a conviction , that would set she ten year forwarder at least . but , poor lady , she be so _young , in spite of she wrinkle , that I be really concerned for she affectation ; because it expose she to the remark and ridicule of the gentleman , and give one pain for she . surely , these lady do not act prudently at all ; since , for every year would take from she age , she censurer add two to it ; and , behind she back , make she go on towards seventy ; whereas , if she would lay claim to she _reverential , as I may say , and not try to conceal she age , she would have many compliment for look so well at she year . -- and many a young body would hope to be the better for she advice and experience , who now be afraid of affront she , if they suppose she have liv much longer in the world than themselves . then she look back to the year she own , when more flippant lady , at the laughing time of she life , delight to be frolic : she try to s too , although , if ever she have a voice , she have outlive it ; and she songs be of so antique a date , that they would betray she ; only , as she say , they be learn she by she grandmother , who be a fine lady at the restoration . she will join in a dance ; and though she limb move not so pliantly as might be expect of a lady no older than she would be think , and whose dancing - day be not entirely over , yet that be owe to a fall from she horse some year ago , which , she doubt , she shall never recover , though she find she grow better and better , _every year . thus she lose the respect , the reverence , she might receive , be it not for this miserable affectation ; take pain , by a , to make herself unworthy of she year , and be content to be think less discreet than she might otherwise be deem , for fear she should be imagine older if she appear wiser . what a sad thing be this , ! -- what a mistaken conduct ! we pray to live to old age ; and it be promise as a blessing , and as a reward for the performance of certain duty ; and yet , when we come to it , we have rather be think as foolish as , than to be deem wise , and in possession of it . and so we show how little we deserve what we have be so long coveting ; and yet covet on : for what ? why , to be more and more asham , and more and more unworthy of that we covet ! how fantastic a character be this ! - well may irreverent , unthinking youth despise , instead of revere , the hoary head which the wearer be so much asham of . the lady boast a relationship to you , and and , I think , I be very bold . but my reverence for year , and the disgust I have to see anybody behave unworthy of they , make I take the greater liberty : which , however , I shall wish I have not take , if it meet 's not with that allowance , which I have always have from you ladyship in what I write . know whether ever I may enjoy the bless I so much revere in other . for now my heavy time approach . but I be so apprehensive before , and so troublesome to my best friend , with my vapourish fear , that now ( with a perfect resignation to the ) I will only add , that I be _you ladyship 's most obliged sister and servant , P.B. my dear , and , improve every day , and be all I can desire or expect they to be . could 's poor mamma be here with a wish , and back again , how much would she be delighted with one of we afternoon conference ; we employment especially ! -- and let I add , that I be very happy in another young gentleman of the dean 's recommending , instead of . MY , I be once more , bless be for all he mercy to I ! enable , on my upsitting , to thank you , and my noble lord , for all you kind solicitudes for my welfare . Billy every day improve . miss be all I wish she to be , and my second dear boy continue to be as lovely and as fine a baby as you ladyship be pleased to think he ; and they papa , the best of husband ! I be glad to hear be likely to be so happy . say ,
, she noble admirer be as worthy a gentleman as any in the peerage ; and I beg of you to congratulate the dear lady , and she noble parent , in my name , if I should be at a distance , when the nuptial be celebrate . I have have the honour of a visit from my lady , the Countess Dowager , on occasion of she leave the kingdom for a year or two , for which space she design to reside in , principally at or ; a design she take up some time ago , but which it seem she could not conveniently put into execution till now . be abroad when she ladyship come , and I expect he not till the next day . she send she gentleman , the preceding evening , to let I know that business have bring she as far as ; and if it would not be unacceptable , she would pay she respects to I at breakfast , the next morning , be speedily to leave . I return , that I should be very proud of that honour . and about ten she ladyship come . she be exceedingly fond of my two boy , the little man , and the pretty baby , as she call they ; and I have very different emotion from the expression of she love to , and she visit to I , from what I have once before . she be sorry , she say , be abroad ; though she business be principally with I . " for , , " say she , " I come to tell you all that pass between . and myself , that you may not think worse of either of we , than we deserve ; and I could not leave till I have wait on you for this purpose ; and yet , perhaps , from the distance of time , you will think it needless now . and , indeed , I should have wait on you before , to have clear up my character with you , have I think I should have be so long keep on this side of the water . " -- I say , I be very sorry I have ever be uneasy , when I have two person of so much honour -- " Nay , " say she , interrupt I , " you have no need to apologize ; thing look bad enough , as they be present to you , to justify greater uneasiness than you express . " she ask I , who that pretty genteel be ?-- I say , a relation of , who be entrust lately to my care . " then , , " say she ladyship , and kiss she , " you be very happy . " believe the Countess be desirous of be alone with I , I say , " my dear , will not you go to you little nursery , my love ? " for so she call my last blessing -- " you would be sorry the baby should cry for you . " for she be so take with the charming lady , that she be loth to leave we -- but , on my say this , withdrew . when we be alone , the Countess begin she story , with a sweet confusion , which add to she loveliness . she say she would be brief , because she should exact all my attention , and not suffer I to interrupt she till she have do . she begin with acknowledging , that she think , when she first see at the masquerade , that he be the finest gentleman she have ever see ; that the allow freedom of the place have make she take libertie in follow he , and engage he wherever he go . she blame he very freely for passing for a single man ; for that , she say , since she have so splendo a fortune of she own , be all she be solicitous about ; have never , as she confess , see a man she could like so well ; she former marriage have be in some sort force upon she , at a age when she know not how to distinguish ; and that she be very loth to believe he marry , even when she have no reason to doubt it . " yet this I must say , " say she , " I never hear a man , when he own he be marry , express himself with more affectionate regard and fondness than he do of you ; which make I long to see you ; for I have a great opinion of those personal advantage which every one flatter I with ; and be very unwilling to yield the palm of beauty to you . " I believe you will censure I , , for permit he visit after I know he be marry . to be sure , that be a thoughtless , and a faulty part of my conduct . but the world 's saucy censure , and my friend ' indiscreet interposal , incense I ; and , know the uprightness of my own heart , I be resolve to disgrase both , when I find they could not think worse of I than they do . " I be naturally of a high spirit , impatient of contradiction , always give myself freedom , for which , satisfied with my own innocence , I think myself above be accountable to any body -- and then . have such noble sentiment , a courage and fearlessness , which I see on more occasion than one , that all lady who know the weakness of they own sex , and how much they want the protection of
of the brave , be take with . then he personal address be so peculiarly distinguishe , that have a opinion of he honour , I be embarrassed greatly how to deny myself he conversation ; although , you will pardon I , , I begin to be afraid that my reputation might suffer in the world 's opinion for the indulgence . " then , when I have resolve , as I do several time , to see he no more , some unforeseen accident throw he in my way again , at one entertainment or other ; for I love ball and concert , and public diversion , perhaps , better than I ought ; and then I have all my resolve to begin again . yet this I can truly say , whatever he view be , I never hear from he the least indecent expression , nor see in he behaviour to I much to apprehend ; save , I begin to fear , that by he insinuating address , and noble manner , I should be too much in he power , and too little in my own , if I go on so little doubting , and so little alarmed , if ever he should avow dishonourable designs . " I have often lamented , that we sex be prohibit , by the design of the other upon they honour , and by the world 's censure , from converse with the same ease and freedom with gentleman , as with one another . and when once I ask myself , to want this conversation might tend at last ? and where the pleasure each seem to take in the other 's , might possibly end ? I resolve to break it off ; and tell he my resolution next time I see he . but he stop my mouth with a romantic notion , as I since think it , ( though a sorry plea will have weight in favour of a proposal , to which one have no aversion ) of Platonic love ; and we have a intercourse by letter , to the number of six or eight , I believe , on that and other subject . " yet all this time , I be the less apprehensive , because he always speak so tenderly , and even with delight , whenever he mention he lady ; and I could not find , that you be at all alarmed at we acquaintance : for I never scruple to send my letter , by my own livery , to you house , seal with my own seal . at last , indeed , he begin to tell I , that from the sweetest and evenest temper in the world , you seem to be lean towards melancholy , were always in tear , or shew you have be weep , when he come home ; and that you do not make he return to you so agreeable as he use to find it . " I ask if it be not owe to some alteration in he own temper ? if you might not be uneasy at we acquaintance , and at he frequent absence from you , and the like ? he answer , no ; that you be above disguis , be of a noble and frank nature , and would have hinte it to he , if you have . this , however , when I begin to think seriously of the matter , give I but little satisfaction ; and I be more and more convinced , that my honour require it of I , to break off this intimacy . " and although I permit to go with I to , when I go to take a house there , yet I be uneasy , as he see . and , indeed , so be he , though he tarry a day or two longer than he design , on account of a little excursion my sister and she lord , and he and I , make into , to see a estate I think of purchasing ; for he be so good as to look into my affair , and have put they upon a admirable establishment . " he uneasiness , I find , be upon you account , and he send you a letter to excuse himself for not wait on you on , and to say , he would dine with you on . and I remember when I say , ' , you seem to be chagrin at something ; you be more thoughtful than usual : ' he answer be , ' madam , you be right , and I have have a little misunderstanding . she be so solemn , and so melancholy of late , I fear it will be no difficult matter to put she out of she right mind : and I love she so well , that then I should hardly keep my own . ' " ' be there no reason , think you , ' say I , 'too imagine that you acquaintance with I give she uneasiness ? you know , , how that villain . ' ( a man , " say she , " whose insolent address I reject with the contempt it deserv ) ' have slander we . how know you , but he have find a way to you wife 's ear , as he have do to my uncle 's , and to all my friend ' ? and if so , it be best for we both to discontinue a friendship , that may be attend with disagreeable consequence . ' " he say , he should find it out on he return . ' and will you , ' say I , ' ingenuously acquaint I with the issue of you inquiry ? for ,
, ' add I , 'I never beheld a countenance , in so young a lady , that seem to mean more than . . 's , when I see she in town ; and notwithstand she prudence I could see a reserve and thoughtfulness in it , that , if it be not natural to it , must indicate too much . ' " he write to I , in a very moving letter , the issue of you conference , and refer to some papers of you 's , that he would show I , as soon as he could procure they , they be of you own hand ; and let I know that be the accuser , as I have suspect . " in brief , Madam , when you go down into , he read to I some part of you account to , of you informant and information ; you apprehension ; you prudence ; you affection for he ; the reason of you melancholy ; and , to all appearance , reason enough you have , especially from the letter of , which be one of . vile forgery : for though we have often , for argument 's sake , talk of polygamy ( he argue for it , I against it ) , yet have not da , nor be he inclin , I verily believe , to propose any such thing to I : no , Madam , I be not so much abandon to a sense of honour , as to give reason for any one , but my impertinent and foolish uncle , to impute such a folly to I ; and he have so behaved to I , that I care not what _he_ think . " then , what he read to I , here and there , as he please , give I reason to admire you for you generous opinion of one you have so much seem cause to be afraid of : he tell I he apprehension , from you uncommon manner , that you mind be in some degree affect , and you strange proposal of part with a husband every one know you so dearly love : and we agree to forbear see each other , and all manner of correspondence , except by letter , for one month , till some of my affair be settle , which have be in great disorder , and be in he kind management then ; and I have not one relation , whom I care to trouble with they , because of they treatment of I on . account . and this , I tell he , should not be neither , but through you hand , and with you consent . " and thus , , " say she ladyship , " have I tell you the naked truth of the whole affair . I have see very seldom since : and when I have , it have be either at a horse - race , in the open field , or at some public diversion , by accident , where only distant civility have pass between we . " I respect he greatly ; you must allow I to say that . except in the article of permit I to believe , for some time , that he be a single gentleman , a fault he can not be excuse for , and which make I heartily quarrel with he , when I first know it , he have behave to I with so much generosity and honour , that I could have wish I have be of he sex , since he have a lady so much more deserving than myself ; and then , have he have the same esteem for I , there never would have be a more perfect friendship . I be now go , " continue she , " to embark for , and shall pass a year or two in ; and then I shall , I hope , return as solid , as grave , as circumspect , though not so wise , as . " thus the Countess conclude she narrative : I say , I be greatly oblige to she for the honour of this visit , and the kind and considerate occasion of it : but that . have make I entirely happy in every particular , and have do she ladyship the justice she so well deserve , have take upon himself the blame of passing as a single man at he first acquaintance with she . I add , that I could hope she ladyship might be prevent , by some happy man , from leave a kingdom , to which she be so great a ornament , as well by she birth , she quality and fortune , as by she perfection of person and mind . she say , she have not be the happiest of she sex in she former marriage : although nobody , she youth consider , think she a bad wife ; and she lord 's goodness to she , at he death , have demonstrate he own favourable opinion of she by deeds , as he have do by word upon all occasion : but that she be yet young ; a little too gay and unsettled : and have she head turn towards and , have pass some time in those country , which she think of with pleasure , though then only twelve or thirteen : that for this reason , and have be on a late occasion still more unsettled ( look down with blush , which often overspread she face , as she talk ) , she have refuse some offer , not despicable : that indeed threaten to follow she to , in hope of meet better success there , than he have meet with here :
: but if he do , though she would make no resolution , she might be too much offended with he , to give he reason to boast of he journey ; and this the rather , as she believe he have once entertaine no very honourable notion of she friendship for . she wish to see . and to take leave of he , but not out of my company , she be pleased to say .-- " you ladyship 's consideration for I , " reply I , " lay I under high obligation ; but indeed , Madam , there be no occasion for it , from any diffidence I have in you 's or . honour . and if you will give I the pleasure of know when it will be most acceptable , I will beg of to oblige I with he company to return this favour , the first visit I make abroad . " " you be very kind , , " say she : " but I think to go to for a fortnight , when I have dispose of every thing for my embarkation , and so set out from thence . and if you should then be both in , I should be glad to take you at you word . " to be sure , I say , at least , would attend she ladyship there , if any thing should happen to deprive I of that honour . " you be very obliging , " say she , " I take great concern to myself , for have cause you a moment 's uneasiness formerly : but I must now try to be circumspect , in order to retrieve my character , which have be so basely traduce by that presumptuous fellow Turner , who hope , I suppose , by that mean , to bring I down to he level . " she ladyship would not be prevail upon to stay dinner ; and , say she would be at all the next day , take a very tender leave of I , wish I all manner of happiness , as I do she . come home in the evening , and next morning rode to , to pay he respects to the Countess , and come back in the evening . thus happily , and to the satisfaction of all three , as I hope , end this perplexing affair . ask I how I relish 's Treatise on Education _? which he put into my hand some time since , as I tell you ladyship . I answer , very well ; and I think it a excellent piece in the main . " I will tell you , " say he , " what you shall do . you have not shew I any thing you have write for a good while . I could wish you to fill up you leisure - time with you observation on that treatise , that I may know what you can object to it ; for you say _in the main , which shew , that you do not entirely approve of every part of it . " " but will not that be presumptuous , ? " " I admire , " reply he ; " and I admire my . I have no doubt of he excellency , but I want to know the sentiment of a young mother , as well as of a learn gentleman , upon the subject of education ; because I have hear several lady censure some part of he regimen , when I be convince , that the fault lie in they own over -great fondness for they child . " " as to myself , , who , in the early part of my life , have not be brotch up too tenderly , you will hardly meet with any objection to the part which I imagine you have hear most object to by lady who have be more indulgently treat in they first stage . but there be a few other thing that want clear up to my understanding ; but , which , however , may be the fault of that . " " then , my dear , " say he , " suppose I at a distance from you , can not you give I you remark in the same manner , as if you be write to , or to , that be ? " " yes , , depend on you kind favour to I , I believe I could . " " do then ; and the less restraint you write with , the more I shall be pleased with it . but I confine you not to time or place . we will make we excursion as I once propose ; and do you write to I now - and - then upon the subject ; for the place and remarkable you will see , will be new only to yourself ; nor will either of those ladie expect from you a itinerary , or a particular description of country , which be better describe by authors who have make it they business to treat upon those subject . by this mean , you will be usefully employ in you own way , which may turn to good account to we both , and to the dear child , which it may please to bestow upon we . " " you do not expect , , any thing regular , or digest from I . " " I do not , my dear . let you fancy and you judgment be both employ , and I require no method ; for I know , in you easy , natural way , that would be a confinement , which would cramp you genius , and give what you write a stiff ,
, formal air , that I might expect in a pedagogue , but not in my . " " well , but , , although I may write nothing to the purpose , yet if desire it , you will allow I to transmit what I shall write to she , when you have peruse it yourself ? for you good sister be so indulgent to my scribble , she will expect to be always hear from I ; and this way I shall oblige she ladyship while I obey she brother . " " with all my heart , " he be pleased to say . so , my lady , I shall now - and - then pay my respects to you in the write way , though I must address myself , it seem , to my dearest ; and I hope to be receive on these my own term , since they be you brother 's also , and , at the same time , such as will convince you , how much I wish to approve myself , to the best of my poor ability , _you ladyship 's most obliged sister , and humble servant , my dearest , I have be consider of you command , in relation to 's book , and since you be pleased to give I time to acquit myself of the task , I shall beg to include in a little book my humble sentiment , as I do to , in that I shew you in relation to the play I have see . and since you confine I not to time or place , I may be three or four year in complete it , because I shall reserve some subject to my further experience in child 's way and temper , and in order to benefit myself by the good instruction I shall receive from you delightful conversation , in that compass of time , if spare we to one another : and then it will , moreover , be still worthier of the perusal of the most honoured and best beloved of all my correspondent , much honoure and belove as they all be . I must need say , my dear , that this be a subject to which I be always particularly attentive ; and among the charity you bountiful heart permit I to dispense to the poor and indigent , I have have always a watchful eye upon the child of such , and endeavoure , by question put to they , as well as to they parent , to inform myself of they little way and temper , and how nature delights to work in different mind , and how it might be point to they good , accord to they respective capacity ; and I have for this purpose erect , with you approbation , a little school of seven or eight child , among which be four in the earliest stage , when they can but just speak , and call for what they want and love : and I be not a little pleased to observe , when I visit they in they school time that principle of goodness and virtue may be instil into they little heart much earlier than be usually imagine . and why should it not be so ? for may not the child , that can tell its want , and make know its inclination , be easily make sensible of _your , and what you expect from it , provide you take a proper method ? for , sometimes , sign and token ( and even look ) , uniformly practise , will do as well as word ; as we see in such of the young of the brute creation as we be dispose to domesticate , and to teach to practise those little trick , of which the aptness or docility of they nature make they capable . but yet , dearest Sir , I know not enough of the next stage , the _maturer part of life , to touch upon that as I wish to do : and yet there be a natural connection and progression from the one to the other : and I would not be think a vain creature , who believe herself equal to _every subject , because she be indulge with the good opinion of she friend , in a _few , which be suppose to be within she own capacity . for , I humbly conceive , that it be no small point of wisdom to know , and not to mistake , one 's own talents : and for this reason , permit I , , to suspend , till I be better qualified for it , even my own proposal of begin my little book ; and , in the mean time , to touch upon a few place of the admirable author , that seem to I to warrant another way of think , than that which he prescribe . but , dear Sir , let I premise , that all that you dear baby can demand of my attention for some time to come , be they health ; and have bless they with such sound limb , and , to all appearance , good constitution , that I have very little to do , but to pray for they every time I pray for they dear papa ; and that be hourly ; and yet not so often as you confer upon I benefit and favour , and new obligation , even to the prevention of all my wish , be I to sit down and study for what must be the next . as to this point of _health , give these plain and easy to be observe rule . he prescribe first , _plenty of open air_. that this be right , the infant will
will inform one , who , though it can not speak , will make sign to be carry abroad , and be never so well pleased , as when enjoy the open and free air ; for which reason I conclude , that this be one of those natural pointing , as I may say , that be implant in every creature , teach it to choose its good , and to avoid its evil . _sleep_ be the next , which he enjoin to be indulge to its utmost extent : a admirable rule , as I humbly conceive ; since sound sleep be one of the greatest nourisher of nature , both to the once young and to the _twice_ young , if I may use the phrase . and I the rather approve of this rule , because it keep the nurse unemployed , who otherwise may be do it the greatest mischief , by cramming and stuff its little bowel , till ready to burst . and , if I be right , what a inconsiderate and foolish , as well as pernicious practice it be , for a nurse to _waken_ the child from its nourishing sleep , for fear it should suffer by hunger , and instantly pop the breast into its pretty mouth , or provoke it to feed , when it have no inclination to either , and for want of digestion , must have its nutriment turn to repletion , and bad humours ! excuse I , dear , these lesser particular . begin with they ; and surely they may be allow in a young _mamma_ , write ( however it be to a gentleman of genius and learn ) to a _papa_ , on a subject , that in its lowest beginning ought not to be unattended to by either . I will therefore pursue my excellent author without farther apology , since you have put he work into my hand . the next thing , then , which he prescribe , be _plain diet . this speak for itself , for the baby can have no corrupt taste to gratify : all be pure , as out of the hand of ; and what be not plain and natural , must vitiate and offend . then , _no wine , or _strong drink _. equally just ; and for the same reason . or _no physic_. undoubtedly right . for the _use_ of physic , without necessity , or by way of _precaution , as some call it , beget the _necessity of physic ; and the very _word_ suppose _distemper_ or _disorder ; and where there be none , would a parent beget one ; or , by frequent use , render the salutary force of medicine ineffectual , when it be want ? next , he forbid too warm_ and _too strait clothing . this be just as I wish it . how often have my heart ach , when I have see poor baby roll and swath , ten or a dozen time round ; then blanket upon blanket , mantle upon that ; it be little neck pin down to one posture ; it be head , more than it frequently need , triple - crown like a young pope , with cover upon cover ; its leg and arm , as if to prevent that kindly stretch , which we rather ought to promote , when it be in health , and which be only aim at growth and enlargement , the former bundle up , the latter pin down ; and how the poor thing lie on the nurse 's lap , a miserable little pinioned captive , goggl and star with its eye , the only organ it have at liberty , as if supplicat for freedom to its fettered limb ! have it any comfort at all , till with a sigh or two , like a dying deer , it drop asleep ; and happy then will it be till the officious nurse 's care shall awake it for its undesired food , as if resolve to try its constitution , and willing to see how many difficulty it could overcome . then he advise , that the head and foot should be keep cold ; and the latter often use to cold water , and expose to wet , in order to lay the foundation , as he say , of a healthy and hardy constitution . now , , what a pleasure it be to you , that she notion , and she practice too , fall in so exactly with this learn gentleman 's advice that , except one article , which be , that you have not yet be accustom to be _wet - shod , every other particular have be observe ! and do not you see what a charming , charme baby he be ?-- , and so be you little Davers , for he age -- pretty soul ! perhaps some , be they to see this , would not be so ready , as I know _you_ will be , to excuse I ; and would be apt to say , " what nursery impertinence be these to trouble a man with ! " --but with all they wisdom , they would be mistaken ; for if a child have not good health , ( and be not these rule the moral foundation , as I may say , of that blesse ? ) it be animal organ will play but poorly in a weak or crazy case . these , therefore , be necessary rule to be observ for the first two or three year : for then the little bud of they minds will begin to open , and they watchful mamma will be employ like a skilful gardener , in assisting and encourage the charming flower through its several
several hopeful stage to perfection , when it shall become one of the principal ornament of that delicate garden , you honoured family . pardon I , Sir , if in the above paragraph I be too figurative . I begin to be afraid I be out of my sphere , write to you dear self , on these important subject . but be that as it may , I will here put a end to this my first letter ( on the earliest part of my subject ) , rejoice in the opportunity you have give I of produce a fresh instance of that duty and affection , wherewith I be , and shall ever be , my dearest , _your grateful , happy , I will now , my dearest , my best belove correspondent of all , begin , since the tender age of my dear baby will not permit I to have a eye yet to they _better_ part , to tell you what be the little matter to which I be not quite so well reconcile in : and this I shall be better enable to do , by my observation upon the temper and natural bent of my dear , as well as by those which my visit to the bigger child of my little school , and those at the cottage adjacent , have enable I to make ; for human nature , Sir , you be not to be tell , be human nature , whether in the high - bear , or in the low . this excellent author ( section 52 ) , have justly disallow of slavish and corporal punishment in the education of those we would have to be wise , good , and ingenuous man , add , " on the other side , to flatter child by reward of thing that be pleasant to they , be as carefully to be avoid . he that will give he son apple , or sugar- plum , or what else of this kind he be most delighted with , to make he learn he book , do but authorize he love of pleasure , and cocker up that dangerous propensity , which he ought , by all means , to subdue and stifle in he . you can never hope to teach he to master it , whilst you compound for the check you give he inclination in one place , by the satisfaction you propose to it in another . to make a good , a wise , and a virtuous man , ' tis fit he should learn to cross he appetite , and deny he inclination to riche , finery , or pleas he palate , & c . " this , , be well say ; but be it not a little too philosophical and abstract , not only for the generality of child , but for the age he suppose they to be of , if one may guess by the apple and the sugar-plum propose for the reward of they well - do ?-- would not this require that memory or reflection in child , which , in another place , be call the concomitant of prudence and age , and not of childhood ? it be undoubtedly very right , to check a unreasonable appetite , and that at its first appearance . but if so small and so reasonable a inducement will prevail , surly , , it might be comply with . a generous mind take delight to win over other by good usage and mildness , rather than by severity ; and it must be a great pain to such a one , to be always inculcat , on he child or pupil , the doctrine of self - denial , by methods quite grievous to he own nature . what I would then humbly propose , be , that the encouragement offer to , should , indeed , be innocent one , as the gentleman enjoin , and not such as would lead to luxury , either of food or apparel ; but I humbly think it necessary , that reward , proper reward , should be propose as incentife to laudable action : for be it not by this method that the whole world be influence and govern ? do not God himself , by reward and punishment , make it we interest , as well as we duty , to obey he ? and can we propose ourselves , for the government of we child , a better example than that of the Creator ? this fine author seem to think he have be a little of the strictest , and liable to some exception . " I say not this , " proceed he , ( section 53 ) " that I would have child keep from the convenience or pleasur of life , that be not injuriious to they health or virtue . on the contrary , I would have they life make as pleasant and as agreeable to they as may be , in a plentiful enjoyment of whatsoever might innocently delight they . " - and yet he immediately subjoin a very hard and difficult proviso to this indulgence .-- " provide , " say he , " it be with this caution , that they have those enjoyment only as the consequence of the state of esteem and acceptation they be in with they parent and governors . " I doubt , my dear , this be expect such a distinction and discretion in child , as they seldom have in they tender year , and require capacity not commonly to be meet with ; so that it be not prescrib to the _generality , as this excellent author intend . ' Tis , I humbly conceive , next to impossible that they tender mind should distinguish beyond fact ; they
they covet this or that play - thing , and the parent , or governor , take advantage of its desire , and annex to the indulgence such or such a task or duty , as a condition ; and shew himself please with its compliance with it : so the child win its plaything , and receive the commendation so necessary to lead on young minds to laudable pursuit . but shall it not be suffer to enjoy the innocent reward of its compliance , unless it can give satisfaction , that it be greatest delight be not in have the thing covet , but in perform the task , or obey the injunction impos upon it as a condition of its be oblige ? I doubt , , this be a little too strict , and not to be expect from child . a servant , full - grown , would not be able to show , that , on condition he comply with such and such term ( which , it be to be suppose by the offer , he would not have comply with , but for that inducement ) , he should have such and such a reward ; I say , he would hardly be able to show , that he preferre the pleasure of perform the requisite condition to the stipulated reward . be it necessary he should : for he be not the less a good servant , or a virtuous man , if he own the condition painful , and the reward necessary to he low state in the world , and that otherwise he would not undergo any service at all .-- why then should this be exact from a child ? let , therefore , innocent reward be propose , and let we be contente to lead on the ductile mind of child to a love of they duty , by oblige they with such : we may tell they what we expect in this case ; but we ought not , I humbly conceive , to be too rigorous in exact it ; for , after all , the inducement will naturally be the uppermost consideration with the child : not , as I hint , have it be offer to it , if the parent himself have not think so . and , therefore , we can only let the child know he duty in this respect , and that he _otch to give a preference to that ; and then rest ourselves contente , although we should discern , that the reward be the chief incentive , of it . for this , from whatever motive inculcate , may beget a habit in the child of do it : and then , as it improve in year , one may hope , that reason will take place , and enable he , from the most solid and durable motive , to give a preference to the duty . upon the whole , then , can we insist upon it , that the child should so nicely distinguish away its little _innate_ passion , as if we expect it to be bear a philosopher ? self -denial be , indeed , a most excellent doctrine to be inculcate into child , and it must be do _early : but we must not be too severe in we exact it ; for a duty too rigidly insist upon , will make it odious . this , too , observe in another place , on the head of too great severity ; which he illustrate by a familiar comparison : " Offensive circumstance , " say he , " ordinarily infect innocent thing which they be join with . and the very sight of a cup , wherein any one use to take nauseous physic , turnd he stomach ; so that nothing will relish well out of it , though the cup be never so clean and well - shape , and of the richest material . " permit I to add , that write still more rigorously on the subject of reward ; which I quote , to show I have not misunderstand he : " but these enjoyment , " say he , " should _never be offer or bestow on child , as the reward of this or that particular performance that they show a aversion to , or to which they would not have apply themselves without that temptation . " if , dear , the mind of child can be lead on by innocent inducement to the performance of a duty , of which they be capable , what I have humbly offer , be enough , I presume , to convince one , that it _may be done . but if ever a particular study be propose to be master , or a bia to be overcome ( that be not a _indispensable requisite to he future life of moral ) to which the child shew a aversion , I would not , methink , have he be too much temp or compelle to conquer or subdue it , especially if it appear to be a _natural or rivet aversion . for , permit I to observe , that the education and study of child ought , as much as possible , to be suit to they capacity and inclination , and , by these mean , we may expect to have always _useful_ and often _great_ men , in different profession ; for that genius which do not prompt to the prosecution of one study , may shine in another no less necessary part of science . but , if the promise of innocent reward _would conquer this aversion , yet they should not be apply with this view ; for the best consequence that can be hope for , will be tolerable skill in one thing , instead of most excellent
excellent in another . nevertheless , I must repeat , that if , as the child grow up , and be capable of so much reason , that , from the love of the _inducement , one can raise he mind to the love of the _duty _, it should be do by all means . but , my dear , I be afraid that _that parent or tutor will meet with but little success , who , in a child 's tender year , shall refuse to comply with its foible , till he see it value its duty , and the pleasure of obey he command , beyond the little enjoyment on which he heart be fix . for , as I humbly conceive , that mind which can be bring to prefer its duty to its appetite , will want little of the perfection of the wisest philosopher . besides , , permit to I say , that I be afraid this perpetual opposition between the passion of the child and the duty to be enforce , especially when it see how other child be indulge ( for if this regimen could be observe by _any , it would be impossible it should become _general , while the fond and the inconsiderate parent be so large a part of mankind ) , will cow and dispirit a child , and will , perhaps produce , a necessity of make use of severity , to subdue he to this temper of self - denial ; for if the child refuse , the parent must insist ; and what will be the consequence ? must it not introduce a harsher discipline than this gentleman allow of ?-- and which , I presume to say , do never yet do good to any but to slavish and base spirit , if to they ; a discipline which every where justly condemn . see here , dear , a specimen of the presumption of you girl : " what will she come to in time ! " you will perhaps say , " she next step will be to arraign myself . " no , no , dear , do not think so : for my duty , my love , and my reverence , shall be you guard , and defend you from every thing saucy in I , but the bold approaches of my gratitude , winch shall always testify for I , how much I be _you oblige and dutiful servant , my , I will continue my subject , although I have not have a opportunity to know whether you approve of my notion or not by reason of the excursion you have be pleased to allow I to make in you beloved company to the sea -port of this kingdom , and to the more note inland town of , , , , and , which have give I infinite delight and pleasure , and enlarge my notion of the wealth and power of the kingdom , in which 's goodness have give you so considerable a stake . my next topic will be upon a _home_ education , which prefer , for several weighty reason , to a _school_ one , provide such a tutor can be procure , as he make next to a impossibility to procure . the gentleman have set forth the inconveniency of both , and be himself so discourage , on a review of they , that he be ready , as he say , to throw up he pen . my chief care , dear , on this head , be three : 1st , the difficulty which , as I say , make almost insuperable , to find a qualified tutor . 2 ndly , the necessity there be , accord to , of keep the youth out of the company of the meaner servants , who may set he bad example . and , 3rdly , those still greater difficulty which will arise from the example of he parent , if they be not very discreet and circumspect . as to the qualification of the tutor , suppose , that he be to be so learn , so discreet , so wise , in short , so _perfect a man , that I doubt , and so do , such a one can hardly be meet with for this _humble_ and _slavish employment . I presume , , to call it so , because of the too little regard that be generally pay to these useful man in the family of the great , where they be frequently put upon a foot with the uppermost servants , and the rather , if they happen to be man of modesty . " I would , " say he , " from child 's first begin to talk , have some discreet , sober , nay , _wise person about they , whose care it should be to fashion they right , and to keep they from all ill ; especially the infection of bad company . I think this province require great sobriety , temperance , tenderness , diligence , and discretion ; quality hardly to be find united in person that be to be have for ordinary salary , nor easily to be find any where . " if this , , be the case , do not this excellent author recommend a scheme that be render in a manner impracticable from this difficulty ? as to these quality be more rarely to be meet with in person that be to be have for _ordinary salary , I can not help be of opinion ( although , with , I think no expence should be spared , if that _would do ) that there be as good a chance for find a proper person among the needy scholar ( if not of a low and sordid turn of
of mind ) as among the more affluent : because the narrow circumstance of the former ( which probably become a spur to he own improvement ) will , it be likely , at first set out in the world , make he be glad to embrace such a offer in a family which have interest enough to prefer he , and will quicke he diligence to make he _deserve_ preferment ; and if such a one want any of that requisite politeness , which some would naturally expect from scholar of better fortune , might not that be supply to the youth by the conversation of parent , relation , and visitor , in conjunction with those other help which young man of family and large expectation constantly have , and which few learn tutor can give he ? I say not this to countenance the wretch niggardliness ( which this gentleman justly censure ) of those who grudge a handsome consideration to so necessary and painful a labour as that of a tutor , which , where a deserve man can be meet with , can not be too genteelly reward , nor himself too respectfully treat . I only beg to deliver my opinion , that a low condition be as likely as any other , with a mind not ungenerous , to produce a man who have these good quality , as well for the reason I have hint at , as for other which might be mention . but thus proceed : " to form a young gentleman as he should be , ' tis fit he governor should be well breed , understand the way of carriage , and measure of civility , in all the variety of _person , _times , and _place and keep he pupil , as far as he age require , constantly to the observation of they . this be a art not to be learn or teach by book .-- nothing can give it but good company and observation join together . " and in another place say , " besides be well - breed , the tutor should know the world well ; the way , the humours , the folly , the cheat , the fault of the age he have fall into , and particularly of the country he live in : these he should be able to show to he pupil , as he find he capable ; teach he skill in man and they manners ; pull off the mask which they several calling and pretence cover they with ; and make he pupil discern what lie at the bottom , under such appearance , that he may not , as unexperienced young man be apt to do , if they be unwarned , take one thing for another , judge by the outside , and give himself up to show , and the insinuation of a fair carriage , or a oblige application ; teach he to guess at , and beware of , the design of man he hath to do with , neither with too much suspicion , nor too much confidence . " this , dear , be excellently say : ' ttis noble _theory ; and if the tutor be a man void of resentment and caprice , and will not be govern by partial consideration , in he own judgment of person and thing , all will be well : but if otherwise , may he not take advantage of the confidence place in he , to the injury of some worthy person , and by degree monopolize the young gentleman to himself , and govern he passion as absolutely , as I have hear some first ministers have do those of they prince , equally to he own personal disreputation , and to the disadvantage of he people ? but all this , and much more , accord to , be the duty of a tutor : and on the finding out such a one , depend he scheme of a home education . no wonder , then , that he himself say , " when I consider the scruple and caution I here lay in you way , methink it look as if I advise you to something which I would have offer at , but in effect not do , " &c .-- permit I , dear , in this place to express my fear that it be hardly possible for any one , with talents inferior to those of himself , to come up to the rule he have lay down upon this subject ; and ' ti to be question , whether even _he , with all that vast stock of natural reason and solid sense , for which , as you tell I , Sir , he be so famous , have attaine to these perfection , at he first set out into life . now , therefore , dear Sir , you can not imagine how these difficulty perplex I , as to my know how to judge which be best , a _home or a _school education . for hear what this excellent author justly observe on the latter , among other thing , no less to the purpose : " I be sure , he who be able to be at the charge of a tutor at home , may there give he son a more genteel carriage , more manly thought , and a sense of what be worthy and become , with a greater proficiency in learn , into the bargain , and ripen he up sooner into a man , than any school can do . not that I blame the schoolmaster in this , " say he , " or think it to be laid to he charge . the difference be great between two or three pupil in the same house , and three
three or four score boy lod up and down ; for , let the master 's industry and skill be never so great , it be impossible he should have fifty or a hundred scholar under he eye any longer than they be in the school together . " but then , , if there be such a difficulty as say , to meet with a proper tutor for the home education , which he thus prefer , what a perplexing thing be this . but still , accord to this gentleman , another difficulty attend a home education ; and that be , what I hint at before , in my second article , the necessity of keep the youth out of the company of the meaner servants , who may set he bad example . for thus he say , " here be another great inconvenience , which child receive from the ill example which they meet with from the meaner servants . they be _wholly , if possible , to be keep from such conversation : for the contagion of these ill precedent , both in civility and virtue , horribly infect child , as often as they come within the reach of it . they frequently learn from unbred or debauch servants , such language , untowardly trick and vex , as otherwise they would be ignorant of all they life . ' tTis a hard matter wholly to prevent this mischief , " continue he ; " you will have very good luck , if you never have a clownish or vicious servant , and if from they you child never get any infection . " then , , my third point ( which I mention in the beginning of this letter ) make a still stronger objection , as it may happen , against a home education ; to wit , the example of the parent themselves , if they be not very circumspect and discreet . all these difficulty be put together , let I , dear , humbly propose it , as a matter for you consideration and determination , whether there be not a middle way to be find out in a school education , that may remedy some of these inconveniency ? for suppose you can not get a tutor so qualified as think he ought to be , for you Billy as he grow up . suppose there be danger from you meaner servant ; or we he parent should not be able to lay ourselves under the requisite restraint , in order to form he mind by we own example , which I hope , by 's , however , will not be the case -- can not some master be find , who shall be so well reward for he care of a _few young gentleman , as to make it worth he while to be contente with those _few ?_--suppose from five to eight at most ; whose moral and breed he may attend to , as well as to they learning ? the farther this master live from the young gentleman 's friend , the better it may be . we will hope , that he be a man of a mild disposition , but strict in he discipline , and who shall make it a rule not to give correction for small fault , or till every other method have be try ; who carry such a just dignity in he manner , without the appearance of tyranny , that he look may be of greater force than the blow of other ; and who will rather endeavou to shame than terrify , a youth out of he fault . then , suppose this gentleman be to allot a particular portion of time for the _more learn study ; and before the youth be tired with _them , suppose another portion be allot for the _writing and _arithmetic ; and then to relieve he mind from both , suppose the _dancing - master_ should take he part ; and innocent exercise of mere diversion , to fill up the rest , at he own choice , in which , divert by such a rotation of employment ( all thus render delightful by they successive variety ) , he would hardly wish to pass much time . for the dancing of itself , with the dancing - master 's instruction , if a well - breed man , will answer both part , that of breeding and that of exercise : and thus different study at once be master . moreover , the emulation which will be inspire , where there be several young gentleman , will be of inconceivable use both to tutor and pupil , in lessen the trouble of the one , and advance the learning of the other , which can not be expect where there be but a single youth to be take care of . such a master will know it to be he interest , as well as duty , to have a watchful eye over the conduct and behaviour of he servants . he assistant , in the different branch of science and education , will be person of approve prudence , for whom he will think himself answerable , since he own _reputation , as well as _livelihood , will depend upon they behaviour . the youths will have young gentleman for they companion , all under the influence of the same precept and direction ; and if some chosen period be fix , as a reward for some excellence , where , at a little desk , raise a step or two above the other seat , the excelling youth should be set to read , under the master 's direction , a little portion from the best translation of the and historians , and even from the best English author ; this might , in
in a very engaging manner , initiate they into the knowledge of the history of past time , and of they own country , and give they a curiosity to pass some of they vacant hour in the same laudable pursuit : for , dear Sir , I must still insist that reward , and innocent gratification , as also little honour and distinction , must need be very attractive to the mind of youth . for , be not the pretty ride , and dairy house breakfaste , by which 's governess distinguish the little lady who in they allot tasnks , a fine encouragement to they ductile mind ? --yes , it be , to be sure !-- and I have often think of it with pleasure , and partake of the delight with which I have suppose they pretty heart must be fill with on that occasion . and why may not such little triumph be , in proportion , as incentive , to child , to make they try to master laudable task ; as the triumph , of different kind , and they mural and civic crown , all which I have hear you speak of , were to they heroe and warrior of old ? for well observe , that -- " man be but child of a larger growth ; we appetite be apt to change as theirs , and full as crave too , and full as vain . " permit I . , to transcribe four or five line more , for the beauty of the thought : " and yet the soul , shut up in she dark room , view so clear abroad , at home see nothing : but like a mole in earth , busy and blind , all she folly up , and cast it outward to the world 's open view -- " improve the thought : methink I can see the dear little , who have , in some eminent task , borne away the palm , make she public entry , as I may call it , after she dairy breakfast and pretty air , into the governess 's court - yard , through a row of she school - fellow , draw out on each side to admire she ; she governess and assistants receive she at the porch , they little capitol , and lift she out with applause and encomium , with a thus shall it be do to the , whom she governess delighteth to honou !_ I see not why the dear in this case , as she move through she admiring school - fellow , may not have she little heart beat with as much delight , be as gloriously elate , proportionably , as that of the greatest hero in he triumphal car , who have return from exploit , perhaps , much less laudable . but how I ramble ! -- yet surely , , you do not expect method or connection from you girl . the education of we sex will not permit that , where it be best . we be force to struggle for knowledge , like the poor feeble infant in the month , who be pin and fetter down upon the nurse 's lap ; and who , if it be little arm happen , by chance , to escape its nurse 's observation , and offer but to expand themselves , be immediately take into custody , and pinion down to they passive behaviour . so , when a poor girl , in spite of she narrow education , break out into notice , she genius be immediately tame by trifling employment , lest , perhaps , she should become the envy of one sex , and the equal of the other . but you . , act more nobly with you Pamela ; for you throw in she way all opportunity of improvement ; and she have only to regret , that she can not make a better use of they , and , of consequence , render herself more worthy of you generous indulgence . I know not how , , to recover my thread ; and so must break off with that delight which I always take when I come near the bottom of my letter to you dear self ; because then I can boast of the honour which I have in be _your ever dutiful , , but , my dear , you will perhaps think , from my last rambling letter , that I be most inclin to a _school_ education for you , and some year hence , if it should please to spare he to we . yet I can not say that I be ; I only lay several thing together in my usual indigested way , to take you opinion upon , which , as it ought , will be always decisive with I . and indeed I be so thoroughly convince by 's reason , where the behaviour of servants can be so well answer for , as that of yours can be , and where the example of the parent will be , as I hope , rather edify than otherwise , that without be sway , as I think , by maternal fondness , in this case , I must need give a preference to the home education ; and the little scheme I presume to form in my last , be only on a supposition , that those necessary point could not be so well secure . in my observation on this head , I shall take the liberty , in one or two particular , a little to differ from a author , that I admire exceedingly ; and that be the present design of my write these letter ; for I shall hereafter , if spare my life , in my little book (
( when you have kindly decide upon the point in which I presume to differ ) show you , , my great reverence and esteem for he ; and can then let you know all my sentiment on this important subject , and that more undoubtedly , as I shall be more improve by year and you conversation ; especially , , if I have the honour and happiness of a foreign tour with you , of which you give I hope ; so much be you pleas with the delight I take in these improve excursion , which you have now favour I with , at different time , through more than half the kingdom . well then , , I will proceed to consider a little more particularly the subject of a home education , with a eye to those difficulty , of which take notice , as I mention in my last . as to the first , that of find a qualified tutor ; we must not expect so much perfection , I doubt , as he lay down as necessary . what , therefore , I humbly conceive be best to be do , will be to avoid choose a man of bigoted and narrow principle ; who yet shall not be taint with sceptical or heterodox notion , nor a mere scholar or pedant ; who have travel , and yet preserve he moral character untainted ; and whose behaviour and carriage be easy , unaffected , unformal , and genteel , as well acquiredly as naturally so , if possible ; who shall not be dogmatical , positive , overbearing , on one hand ; nor too yielding , suppliant , fawn , on the other ; who shall study the child 's natural bent , in order to direct he study to the point he be most likely to excel in ; and to preserve the respect due to he own character from every one , he must not be a busy body in the family , a whisperer , a tale - bearer , but of a benevolent turn of mind , ready to compose difference ; who shall avoid , of all thing , that foppishness of dress and appearance , which distinguish the _petit -maitre , and french usher ( that I have see at some boarding school ) , for coxcomb rather than guide of education : for , as I have hear you , my best tutor , often observe , the peculiarity of habit , where a person aim at something fantastic , or out of character , be a undoubted sign of a wrong head ; for such a one be so kind as always to hang out on he sign what sort of furniture he have in he shop , to save you the trouble of ask question about he ; so that one may as easily know by he outward appearance what he _i , as one can know a widow by she weed . such a person as I have thus negatively describe , may be find without very much difficulty , perhaps , because some of these requisite be personal , and other be such as be obvious at first sight , to a common penetration ; or , where not so , may be find out , by inquiry into he general character and behaviour : and to the care of such a one , dear Sir , let I suppose you be commit : and so we acquit ourselves of the first difficulty , as well as we can , that of the tutor ; who , to become more perfect , may form himself , as to what he want , by 's excellent rule on that head . but before I quit this subject , I beg to remind you of you opinion upon it , in a conversation with , and he nephew , in ; in which you seem to prefer a scottish gentleman for a tutor , to those of you own nation , and still more than to those of ? do not you remember it , dear ? and how much those gentleman be pleased with you facetious freedom with they country , and say , you make they amend for that , in you preference to they learn and travel youth ? if you have forget it , I will here transcribe it from my _record _, as I call my book of memorandum ; for every time I be pleased with a conversation , and have leisure , before it quit my memory , I enter it down in as near the very word as I can ; and now you have make I you correspondent , I shall sometimes , perhaps , give you back some valuable from you own treasure .-- , and , and , be present , I well remember . these be you word : " since the union of the two kingdom , we have many person of condition , who have take they tutor for they son from ; which practice , to speak impartially , have be attend with some advantageous circumstance , that should not be overlook . for , , it must be confess that , notwithstand you narrow and stiff manner of education in , a spirit of manly learn , a kind of poetic liberty , as I may call it , have begin to exert itself in that part of the island . the blustering north -- forgive I , gentleman -- seem to have harden the forehead of she hungry son ; and the keenness with which they set out for preferment in the kindlier south , have teach they to know a good deal of the world betime . through the easy term on which learn be generally attaine there , as it be earlier inculcated
inculcated , so it may , probably , take deeper root : and since ' tis hardly possible -- forgive I , dear Sir -- they can go to a worse country on this side , than some of the northern part of ; so they education , with a view to travel , and to better themselves by settlement in other country , may , perhaps , be so many reason to take greater pain to qualify themselves for this employment , and may make they succeed better in it ; especially when they have be able to shake off the fetter which be rivet upon they under the narrow influence of a too tyrannical kirk discipline , which you , , have just now so freely censure . " to these consideration , when we add the necessity , which these remote tutor lie under , of behave well ; first , because they seldom wish to return to they own country ; and next , because _that can not prefer they , if it would ; and thirdly , because it would not , if it could , if the gentleman be of a enlarge genius , and generous way of think ; I say , when we add to the premise these consideration , they all make a kind of security for they good behaviour : while those of we own country have often friend or acquaintance on whose favour they be apt to depend , and for that reason give less attention to the duty requisite for this important office . " , as they kind friend , who be accustom to spread and strengthen the bold muscle of the strong - feature , have generally blow away that inauspicious bashfulness , which hang a much longer time , commonly , on the face of the southern student ; such a one ( if he fall not too egregiously into the contrary extreme , so as to become insufferable ) may still be the more eligible person for a tutor , as he may teach a young gentleman , betimes , that necessary presence of mind , which those who be confine to a private education sometimes want . " but , after all , if a gentleman of this nation be choose for this employment , it may be necessary that he should be one who have have as genteel and free a education himself , as he country will afford ; and the native roughness of he climate file off by travel and conversation ; who have make , at least , the tour of and , and have a taste for the politeness of the former nation : but from the boisterousness of a , and the fantastic politeness of a , if happily blend , such a mixture may result , as will furnish out a more complete tutor , than either of the two nation , singly , may be able to produce . but it ought to be remembe that this person must have conquer he native brogue , as I may call it , and be a master of the english pronunciation ; otherwise he conversation will be disagreeable to a english ear . " and permit I to add , that , as a acquaintance with the contribute not a little to soften the manners , and give a graceful and delicate turn to the imagination , and a kind of polish to severer study , it would not be amiss that he should have a taste of poetry , although perhaps it be not to be wish he have such strong inclination that way , as to make that lively and delectable amusement he predominant passion : for we see very few poet , whose warm imagination do not run away with they judgment . and yet , in order to learn the dead language in they purity , it will be necessary to inculcate both the love and the study of the ancient poet , which can not fail of give the youth a taste for poetry , in general . " permit I , dear , to ask you , whether you advance this for argument sake , as sometimes you love to amuse and entertain you friend in a uncommon way ? for I should imagine , that we two universities , which you have shew I , and for which I have ever since have a greater reverence than I have before , be capable of furnish as good tutor as any nation in the world : for here the young gentleman seem to I to live both in the _world and in the _university ; and we see several gentleman who have not only fine part , but polite behaviour , and deep learning , as you assure I ; some of whom you entertaine , and be entertain by , in so elegant a manner , that no travel gentleman , if I may be allow to judge , could excel they ! and beside , my dear , I know who be reckon one of the politest and best - breed gentleman in by every body , and learn as well as polite , and yet have he education in one of those celebrate seat of learning . I wish you may never fall short of the gentleman I mean , in all these acquirement ; and he will be a very happy creature , I be sure . but how I wander again from my subject . I have no other way to recover myself , when I thus ramble , but by return to that one delightful point of reflection , that I have the honour to be , dearest Sir , _your ever dutiful and oblige , , I now resume my subject . I have go through the article of the tutor , as well as
as I could ; and will now observe upon what say , that child be wholly , if possible , to be keep from the conversation of the meaner servants ; whom he suppose to be , as too frequently they be , _unbreed and _debauch , to use he own word . now , , I think it be very difficult to keep child from the conversation of servants at all time . the care of personal attendance , especially in the child 's early age , must fall upon servants of one denomination or other , who , little or much , must be conversant with the inferior servants , and so be liable to be taint by they conversation ; and it will be difficult in this case to prevent the taint be communicate to the child . Wherefore it will be a _surer , as well as a more _laudable method , to insist upon the regular behaviour of the whole family , than to expect the child , and its immediate attendent or tutor , should be the only good one in it . be this so difficult to effect , as may be imagine . you family afford a eminent instance of it : the good have be confirm , the remiss have be reform , the passionate have be tame ; and there be not a family in the kingdom , I will venture to say , to the honour of every individual in it , more uniform , more regular , and freer from evil , and more regardful of what they say and do , than yours . and you will allow , that though always honest , yet they be not always so laudable , so exemplarily virtuous , as of late : which I mention only to show the practicableness of a reformation , even where bad habit have take place -- for you , , arrogate not to herself the honour of this change : ' tis owe to the shine upon heart naturally good ; for else a example so easy , so plain , so simple , from so yong a mistress , who moreover have be exalt from they own station , could not have be attend with such happy effect . you see , dear , what a master and mistress 's example could do , with a poor soul so far gone as . and I dare be confident , that if , on the hiring of a new servant , sobriety of manners and a virtuous conversation be insist upon , and a general inoffensiveness in word as well as action be require from they , as indispensable condition of they service : and that a breach of that kind would be no more pass over , than a wilful fraud , or a act of dishonesty ; and if , add to these requisite , they principal take care to support these injunction by they own example ; I say , then , I dare be confident , that if such a service do not _find they good , it would _make_ they so . and why should we not think this a very practicable scheme , consider the servants we take be at year of discretion , and have the strong tie of _interest_ superad to the obligation we require of they ? and which , they must need know ( let them have what bad habit they will ) be right for _themself to discharge , as well as for _us_ to exact . we all know of how much force the example of superior be to inferior . it be too justly say , that the court of prince abound with the most profligate of man , insomuch that a man can not well have a more significantly bad title , than that of Courtier : yet even among these , one shall see the force of _example , as I have hear you , , frequently observe : for , let but the land be blest with a pious and religious prince , who make it a rule with he to countenance and promote man of virtue and probity ; and to put the case still stronger , let such a one even succeed to the most libertine reign , wherein the manners of the people be wholly deprave : yet a wonderful change will be immediately effect . the flagitious livers will be chase away , or reform ; or at least will think it they duty , or they _interest , which be a stronger tie with such , to _appear_ reform ; and not a man will seek for the favour or countenance of he prince , but by laudable pretence , or by worthy action . in the reign of , as I have read , deformity of body be the fashion , and the nobility and gentry of the court think it a indispensable requisite of a graceful form to pad for themselves a round shoulder , because the king be crook . and can we think human nature so absurdly wicked , that it would not much rather have try to imitate a personal perfection , than a deformity so shock in its appearance , in people who be naturally straight ? ' Tis melancholy to reflect , that of all profession of man , the mariner , who most behold the wonder of power display in the great deep ( a sight that have strike I with awe and reverence only from a coast prospect ) , and who every moment , while at sea , have but one frail plank betwixt themselves and inevitable destruction , be yet , generally speak , say to be the most abandoned invoker and blasphemer of the name of that , whose mercy they every moment unthankfully , although so visibly , experience .
. yet , as I once hear at you table , , on a particular occasion , we have now a commander in the british navy , who , to he honour , have shew the force of a excellent example support the best precept : for , on board of he ship , not a oath or curse be to be hear ; while volley of both ( issue from impious mouth in the same squadron , out of he knowledge ) seem to fill the sail of other ship with guilty breath , call aloud for that perdition to overtake they , which perhaps he worthy injunction and example , in he own , might be of weight to suspend . if such then , dear , be the force of a good example , what have parent to do , who would bring up a child at home under they own eye , accord to 's advice , but , first , to have a strict regard to _their_ conduct ! this will not want its due influence on the servants ; especially if a proper enquiry be first make into they character , and a watchful eye have over they , to keep they up to those character afterwards . and when they know they must forfeit the favour of a worthy master , and they place too ( which may be think to be the best of place , because a _uniform_ character must make all around it easy and happy ) , they will readily observe such rule and direction , as shall be prescribe to they -- rule and direction , which they own conscience will tell they be _right to be prescribe ; and even right for they to follow , be they not insist upon by they superior : and this conviction must go a great way towards they _thorough reformation : for a person wholly convince be half reform . and thus the hazard a child will run of be corrupt by conversing with the servants , will be remove , and all 's other rule be better enforce . I have the boldness , , to make another objection ; and that be , to the distance which prescribe to be keep between child and servants : for may not this be a means to fill the mind of the former with a contempt of those below they , and a arrogance that be not warrant by any rank or condition , to they inferior of the same species ? I have before transcribe what have enjoin in relation to this distance , where he say , that the child be by all means to be keep _wholly from the conversation of the meaner servants . but how much better advice do the same author give for the behaviour of child to servant in the follow word which , I humbly think , be not so entirely consistent with the former , as might be expect from so admirable a author . " another way , " say he ( section 111 ) , " to instil sentiment of humanity , and to keep they lively in young folk , will be , to accustom they to civility in they language and deportment towards they inferior , and meaner sort of people , particularly servants . it be not unusual to observe the child in gentleman 's family treat the servants of the house with domineering word , name of contempt , and a imperious carriage , as if they be of another race , or species beneath they . whether ill example , the advantage of fortune or they natural vanity , inspire this haughtiness , it should be prevent or weed out ; and a gentle , courteous , affable carriage towards the lower rank of man place in the room of it . no part of they superiority will be hereby lose , but the distinction increase , and they authority strengthen , when live in inferior be join to outward respect , and the esteem of the person have a share in they submission : and domestic will pay a more ready and cheerful service , when they find themselves not spur , because fortune have lay they below the level of other at they master 's foot . " these , dear , be certainly the sentiments of a generous and enlarge spirit : but I hope , I may observe , that the great distance before enjoin to be keep between child and servants , be not very consistent with the above - cite paragraph : for if we would prevent this undue contempt of inferior in the temper of child , the best way , as I humbly presume to think , be not to make it so unpardonable a fault for they , especially in they early year , to be in they company . for can one make the child shin the servants without render they odious or contemptible to they , and represent they to the child in such disadvantageous light , as must need make the servants vile in they eye , and themselves lofty and exalt in they own ? and thereby cause they to treat they with " domineer word , and a imperious carriage , as if they be of another race or species beneath they ; and so , " as say , " nurse up they natural pride into a habitual contempt of those beneath they ; and then , " as he add , " where will that probably end , but in oppression and cruelty ? " but this matter , dear Sir , I presume to think , will all be happily accommodate and reconcile , when the servants ' good behaviour be secure by the example and injunction of the principal . upon the whole , then , of what
what have enjoin , and what I have take the liberty to suggest on this head , it shall be my endeavour , in that early part of you dear 's education , which you will intrust to I , to inculcate betime in he mind the principle of universal benevolence and kindness to other , especially to inferior . shall I fear , that the little dear will be want to himself in assuming , as he grow up , a air of superiority and distance of behaviour equal to he condition , or that he will descmend too low for he station . for , , there be a pride and self - love natural to human mind , that will seldom be keep so low , as to make they humbler than they ought to be . I have observ , before now , instance of this , in some of the family we visit , between the young Masters or Misse , and those child of lower degree , who have be bring to play with they , or divert they . on the ' and ' side I have always see , they lead the play and prescribe the law of it , be the diversion what it will ; while , on the other hand , they lower - rank play - fellow have generally give into they little humours , though ever so contrary to they own ; and the difference of dress and appearance , and the notion they have of the more eminent condition of they play - fellow ' parent , have beget in they a kind of awe and respect , that perhaps more than sufficiently secure the superiority of the one , and the subordination of the other . the advantage of this universal benevolence to a young gentleman , as he grow up , will be , as I humbly conceive , so to diffuse itself over he mind , as to influence all he action , and give a grace to every thing he do or say , and make he admire and respecte from the best and most durable motive ; and will be of greater advantage to he for he attaine a handsome address and behaviour ( for it will make he conscious that he _merits_ the distinction he will meet with , and encourage he still _more to merit it ) , than the best rule that can be give he for that purpose . I will therefore teach the little dear courteousness and affability , from the properest motives I be able to think of ; and will instruct he in only one piece of pride , that of be above do a mean or low action . I will caution he not to behave in a lordly or insolent manner , even to the lowest servants . I will tell he that that superiority be the most commendable , and will be the best maintain , which be owe to humanity and kindness , and grounde on the perfection of the _mind , rather than on the _accidental_ advantage of _fortune_ and _condition : that if he conduct be such as it ought to be , there will be no occasion to tell a servant , that he will be observe and respecte : that _humility , as I once tell my , be a charming grace , and most conspicuously charme in person of distinction ; for that the poor , who be humble by they condition , can not glory in it , as the rich may ; and that it make the lower rank of people love and admire the high - bear , who can so condescmend : whereas _pride , in such , be meanness and insult , as it owe its boast and its be to accidental advantage ; which , at the same time , be seldom of _his_ procure , who can be so mean as to be proud : that even I would sooner forget pride in a low degree than in a high ; for it may be a security in the first against do a base thing : but in the rich , it be a base thing itself , and a impolitic one too ; for the more distinction a proud mind grasp at , the less it will have ; and every poor despise person can whisper such a one in the ear , when surround with , and adorn by , all he glittering splendour , that he _be bear , and _must_ die , in the _same manner_ with those whom he despise . thus will the doctrine of benevolence and affability , implant early in the mind of a young gentleman , and duly cultivate as he grow up , inspire he with the requisite conduct to command respect from _proper_ motive ; and while it will make the servants observe a decorum towards he , it will oblige they to have a guard upon they word and action in presence of one , whose manner of education and training - up would be so great a reproach to they , if they be grossly faulty : so thus , I conceive , a mutual benefit will flow to the manners of each ; and _his_ good behaviour will render he , in some measure , a instructive monitor to the whole family . but permit I , , to enlarge on the hint I have already give , in relation to the example of parent , in case a preference be give to the home education . for if this point can not be secure , I should always imagine it be best to put the child to such a school , as I formerly mention . but yet the subject might be spare by I in this case , as I write with a
a view only to you family ; though you will remember , that while I follow , whose work be public , I must be consider as direct myself to the generality of the world : for , , I have the pleasure to say , that you conduct in you family be unexceptionable ; and the pride to think that mine be no disgrace to it . no one hear a word from you mouth unbecom the character of a polite gentleman ; and I shall always be very regardful of what fall from mine . you temper , , be equal and kind to all you servant , and they love you , as well as awfully respect you : and well do you beautiful and considerate mind , deserve it of they all : and they , see I be watchful over my own conduct , so as not to behave unworthy of you kind example , regard I as much as I could wish they should ; for well do they know , that they belove master will have it so , and greatly honour and esteem I himself . you table - talk be such as person of the strictest principles may hear , and join in : you guest , and you friend be , generally speak , person of the genteelest life , and of the best manners . so that would have advise _yout _, of all gentleman , have he be liive , and know you , to give you child a home education , and assign these , and still stronger reasons for it . but be we to speak to the generality of parent , I fear this would be a almost insuperable objection to a home education . for ( I be sorry to say it ) when one turn one 's eye to the bad precedent give by the head of some family , it be hardly to be wonder at , that there be so little virtue and religion among man . for can those parent be surprised at the ungraciousness of they _child , who hardly ever show they , that they _own_ action be govern by reasonable or moral motive ? can the gluttonous father expect a self - deny son ? with how ill a grace must a man who will often be disguise in liquor , preach sobriety ? a passionate man , patience ? a irreligious man , piety ? how will a parent , whose hand be seldom without card , or dice in they , be observ in lesson against the pernicious vice of gaming ? can the profuse father , who be squander away the fortune of he child , expect to be regard in a lesson of frugality ? ' tTis impossible he should , except it be that the youth , see how pernicious he father 's example be , should have the grace to make a proper use of it , and look upon it as a sea-mark , as it be , to enable he to shin the dangerous rock , on which he see he father split . and even in this _best_ case , let it be consider , how much shame and disgrace he thoughtless parent ought to take to himself , who can admonish he child by nothing but the _odiousness of he own vice ; and how little it be owe to he , that he guilt be not _double , by he son 's treading in he step ! let such a unhappy parent duly weigh this , and think how likely he be to be , by he bad example , the cause of he child 's perdition , as well as he own , and stand unshocked and unamended , if he can ! it be then of no avail to wish for discreet servants , if the conduct of the parent be faulty . if the fountain - head be pollute , how shall the under - current run clear ? that master and mistress , who would exact from they servants a behaviour which they themselves do not practice , will be but ill observe . and that child , who discover excess and error in he parent , will be find to be less profit by they good precept , than prejudice by bad example . Excessive fondness this hour ; violent passion and perhaps execration , the next ; unguarded jest , and admiration of fashionable vanity , rash censure , be perhaps the best , that the child see in , or hear from those , who be most concerned to inculcate good precept into he mind . and where it be so , a home education must not surely be chosen . have thus , as well as my slender ability will permit , presume to deliver my opinion upon three great point , _viz _. the qualification of a tutor ; the necessity of have a eye to the moral of servants ; and the example of parent ( all which , be take care of , will give a preference , as I imagine , to a home education ) ; permit I , dear , to speak a little further to a point , that I have already touch upon . it be that of _emulation ; which I humbly conceive to be of great efficacy to lead child on in they duty and study . and how , dear , shall this advantage be procure for a young master , who have no school - fellow and who have no example to follow , but that of he tutor , whom he cannot , from the disparity of year , and other circumstance , without pain ( because of this disparity ) , think of emulating ? and this , I conceive , be a very great
great advantage to such a school education , as I mention in my former letter , where there be no more scholar take in , than the master can with ease and pleasure instruct . but one way , in my humble opinion , be leave to answer this objection , and still preserve the reason for the preference which give to a home education ; and that be , what I formerly hint , to take into you family the child of some honest neighbour of but middl circumstances , and like age of you own , but who should give apparent indication of he natural promptitude , ingenuous temper , oblige behaviour and good manners ; and to let he go hand - in - hand with yours in he several study and lesson under the same tutor . the child would be sensible of the benefit , as well as of the distinction , he receive , and consequently of what be expect from he , and would double he diligence , and exert all he good quality , which would inspire the young gentleman with the wish - for emulation , and , as I imagine , would be so promotive of he learning , that it would greatly compensate the tutor for he pain with the additional scholar ; for the young gentleman would be asham to be outdone by one of like year and stature with himself . and little reward might be propose to the greatest proficient , in order to heighten the emulation . then , , the _generosity of such a method , to a gentleman of you fortune , and beneficent mind , would be its own reward , were there no other benefit to be receive from it . moreover , such a ingenious youth might , by he good moral and industry , hereafter be of service , in some place of trust in the family ; or it would be easy for a gentleman of you interest in the world , if such a thing offer not , to provide for the youth in the navy , in some of the public office , or among you private friend . if he prove faulty in he moral , he dismission would be in you own power , and would be punishment enough . but , if on the other hand , he prove a sober and hopeful youth , he would make a excellent companion for you in riper year ; as he would be , in a manner , a corroborator of he moral ; for , as he circumstance would not support he in any extravagance , so they would be a check upon he inclination ; and this be seconde by the hope of future preferment from you favour and interest , which he could not expect but upon the term of he perseverance in virtue , he would find himself under a necessity of set such a example , as might be of great benefit to he companion , who should be watch , as he grow up , that he do not ( if he ample fortune become dangerous to he virtue ) contribute out of he affluence to draw the other after he into extravagance . and to this end , as I humbly conceive , the noble doctrine of _independence_ should be early instil into both they mind , and upon all occasion , inculcate and inforce ; which would be a inducement for the one to endeaavor to _improve_ he fortune by he honest industry , lest he never be enable to rise out of a state of dependence ; and to the other , to _keep ,_ if not to _improve ,_ he own , lest he ever fall into such a servile state , and thereby lose the glorious power of conferr happiness on the deserving , one of the highest pleasure that a generous mind can know ; a pleasure , , which you have oftener experienced than thousand of gentleman : and which may you still continue to experience for a long and happy succession of year , be the prayer of one , the most obliged of all other in she own person , as well as in the persons of she dearest relation , and who owe to this glorious beneficence the honour she boast , of be _your ever affectionate and grateful_ P.B. but now , my dear , if you will indulge I in a letter or two more , preparative to my little book , I will take the liberty to touch upon one or two other place , wherein I differ from this learn gentleman . but first , permit I to observe , that if parent be , above all thing , to avoid give bad example to they child , they will be no less careful to shin the practice of such fond fathers and mother , as be will not to indulge they child in bad habit , and give they they head , at a time when , like wax , they tender mind may be mould into what shape they please . this be a point that , if it please , I will carefully attend to , because it be the foundation on which the superstructure of the whole future man be to be erect . for , accord as he be indulge or check in he childish folly , a ground be laid for he future happiness or misery ; and if once they be suffer to become habitual to he , it can not but be expect , that they will grow up with he , and that they will hardly ever be eradicated . " try it , " say , speak to this very point , " in a dog , or a horse , or any other creature ,
, and see whether the ill and resty trick they have learn when young , be easily to be mende , when they be knit ; and yet none of these creature be half so wilful and proud , or half so desirous to be master of themselves , as man . " and this bring I , dear Sir , to the head of _punishment , in which , as well as in the article of _reward , which I have touch upon , I have a little objection to what advance . but permit I , however , to premise , that I be exceedingly pleased with the method lay down by this excellent writer , rather to shame the child out of he fault , than beat he ; which latter serve generally for nothing but to hare he mind . _Obstinacy , and tell a _lie , and commit a _wilful_ fault , and then persist in it , be , I agree with this gentleman , the only cause for which the child should be punish with stripe : and I admire the reason he give against a too rigorous and severe treatment of child . but I will give 's word , to which I have some objection . " it may be doubt , " say he , " concern whippe , when , as the _last_ remedy , it come to be necessary , at what time , and by whom , it should be do ; whether presently , upon the commit the fault , whilst it be yet fresh and hot . I think it should not be do presently , " add he , " lest passion mingle with it ; and so , though it exceed the just proportion , yet it lose of its due weight . for even child discern whenever we do thing in a passion . " I must beg leave , dear , to differ from in this point ; for I think it ought rather to be a rule with parent , who shall chastise they child , to conquer what would be extreme in _they own passion on this occasion ( for those who can not do it , be very unfit to be the punisher of the wayward passion of they child ) , than to _defer_ the punishment , especially if the child know it 's fault have reach its parent 's ear . it be otherwise , methink , give the child , if of a obstinate disposition , so much more time to hare its mind , and bid defiance to its punishment . just now , dear , you be brotch into my presence , all smile , crow to come to I , and full of heart - cheer promise ; and the subject I be upon go to my heart . surely I can never beat you ! -- dear little life of my life ! how can I think thou canst ever deserve it , or that I can ever inflict it ?-- no , my baby , that shall be thy papa 's task , if ever thou be so heinously naughty ; and whatever _he_ do , must be right . pardon my foolish fondness , dear Sir !-- I will proceed . if , then , the fault be so atrocious as to deserve whippe , and the parent be resolve on this exemplary punishment , the child ought not , as I imagine , to come into one 's presence without meet with it : or else , a fondness too natural to be resist , will probably get the upper hand of one 's resentment , and how shall one be able to whip the dear creature one have cease to be angry with ? then after he have once see one without meet he punishment , will he not be inclin to hope for connivance at he fault , unless it should be repeat ? and may he not be apt ( for child 's resentment be strong ) to impute to cruelty a correction ( when he think the fault have be forget ) that should always appear to be inflict with reluctance , and through motive of love ? if , from anger at he fault , one should go _above the due proportion , ( I be sure I might be trust for this ! ) let it take it be course !-- how barbarously , methinks , I speak !-- he ought to _feel_ the lash , first , because he _deserve it , poor little soul ? next , because it be _propose to be exemplary . and , lastly , because it be not intend to be _often_ use : and the very passion or displeasure one express ( if it be not enormous ) will show one be in earnest , and create in he a necessary awe , and fear to offend again . the _end_ of the correction be to show he the difference between right and wrong . and as it be proper to take he at he first offer of a full submission and repentance ( and not before ) , and instantly dispassionate one 's self , and show he the difference by act of pardon and kindness ( which will let he see that one punish he out of necessity rather than choice ) , so one would not be afraid to make he smart so sufficiently , that he should not soon forget the severity of the discipline , nor the disgrace of it . there be a cruel mamma for you , .! what my _practice_ may be , I can not tell ; but this _theory , I presume to think , be right . as to the _act itself , I much approve 's advice , to do it by pause
pause , mingling stripe and expostulation together , to shame and terrify the more ; and the rather , as the parent , by this slow manner of inflict the punishment , will less need to be afraid of give too violent a correction ; for those pause will afford _him , as well as the _child , opportunity for consideration and reflection . but as to the _person , by whom the discipline should be perform , I humbly conceive , that this excellent author be here also to be object to . " if you have a discreet servant , " say he , " capable of it , and have the place of govern you child ( for if you have a tutor , there be no doubt ) , I think it be best the smart should come immediately from another 's hand , though by the parent 's order , who should see it do , whereby the parent 's authority will be preserve , and the child 's aversion for the pain it suffer , rather be turn on the person that immediately inflict it . for I would have a father seldom strike a child , but upon very urgent necessity , and as the last remedy . " ' Tis in such a urgent case that we be suppose that it should be do at all . if there be not a reason strong enough for the father 's whipp the child himself , there can not be one for he order another to do it , and stand by to see it do . but I humbly think , that if there be a necessity , no one can be so fit as the father himself to do it . the child can not dispute he authority to punish , from whom he receive and expect all the good thing of he life : he can not question _he love to he , and after the smart be over , and he obedience secure , must believe that so tender , so indulgent a father could have no other end in whippe he , but he good . against _him _, he know he have no remedy , but must passively submit ; and when he be convinced he _must , he will in time conclude that he _otch . but to have this severe office perform by a servant , though at the father 's command , and that professedly , that the aversion of the child for the pain it suffer should be turn on the person who immediately inflict it , be , I humbly think , the _reverse of what ought to be do . and _more_ so , if this servant have any direction of the child 's education ; and still much _more_ so , if it be he tutor , though say , there be no doubt , if there be a tutor , that it should be do by he . for , dear Sir , be there no doubt , that the tutor should lay himself open to the aversion of the child , whose manners he be to form ? be not the best method a tutor can take , in order to enforce the lesson he would inculcate , to try to attract the love and attention of he pupil by the most win way he can possibly think of ? and yet be _o , this very tutor _out of all doubt , to be the instrument of do a harsh and disgraceful thing , and that in the last resort , when all other method be find ineffectual ; and that too , because he ought to incur the child 's resentment and aversion , rather than the father ? no , surely , , it be not reasonable it should be so : quite contrary , in my humble notion , there can be no doubt , but that it should be _otherwise . it should , methink , be enough for a tutor , in case of a fault in the child , to threaten to complain to he father ; but yet not to make such a complaint , without the child obstinately persist in he error , which , too , should be of a nature to merit such a appeal : and this might highly contribute to preserve the parent 's authority ; who , on this occasion , should never fail of extort a promise of amendment , or of instantly punish he with he own hand . and , to soften the distaste he might conceive in resentment of too rigid complainings , it might not be amiss , that he interposition in the child 's favour , be the fault not too flagrant , should be permit to save he once or twice from the impending discipline . ' tTis certain that the passion , if I may so call they , of affection and aversion , be very early discoverable in child ; insomuch that they will , even before they can speak , afford we mark for the detection of a hypocritical appearance of love to it before the parent 's face . for the fondness or averseness of the child to some servant , will at any time let one know , whether they love to the baby be uniform and the same , when one be absent , as present . in one case the child will reject with sullenness all the little sycophancy make to it in one 's sight ; while on the other , it be fondness of the person , who generally oblige it , be a infallible rule to judge of such a one 's sincerity behind one 's back . this little observation shew the strength of a child 's resentment , and its sagacity , at the earliest age ,
, in discovering who oblige , and who disoblige it : and hence one may infer , how improper a person _he_ be , whom we would have a child to love and respect , or by whose precept we would have it direct , to be the punisher of its fault , or to do any harsh or disagreeable office to it . for my own part , I beg to declare , that if the parent be not to inflict the punishment himself , I think it much better it should be give he , in the parent 's presence , by the servant of the lowest consideration in the family , and whose manners and example one would be the least willing of any other he should follow . just as the common executioner , who be the lowest and most flagitious officer of the commonwealth , and who frequently deserve , as much as the criminal , the punishment he be choose to inflict , be pitch upon to perform , as a mark of greater ignominy , sentence intend as example to deter other from the commission of heinous crime . the take this method when he be dispose to correct severely he choose people ; for , in that case , he generally do it by the hand of the most profligate nation around they , as we read in many place of the . but the follow rule I admire in : " when , " say he ( for any misdemeanour ) , " the father or mother look sour on the child , every one else should put on the same coldness to he , and nobody give he countenance till forgiveness be ask , and a reformation of he fault have set he right again , and restore he to he former credit . if this be constantly observ , " add he , " I guess there would be little need of blow or chid : they own ease or satisfaction would quickly teach child to court commendation , and avoid do that which they find every body condemn , and they be sure to suffer for , without be chid or beaten . this would teach they modesty and shame , and they would quickly come to have a natural abhorrence for that which they find make they slighte and neglect by every body . " this afford I a pretty hint ; for if ever you charme Billy shall be naughty , I will proclaim throughout you worthy family , that the little dear be in disgrace ! and one shall shin he , another decline answer he , a third say , " no , master , I can not obey you , till you mamma be pleased with you " ; a fourth , " who shall mind what little master bid they do , when they will not mind what they mamma say to they ? " and when the dear little soul find this , he will come in my way , ( and I see , pardon I , my dear , he have some of he papa 's spirit , already , indeed he have ! ) and I will direct myself with double kindness to you beloved Daver , and to my , and not notice the dear creature , if I can help it , till I can see he _papa_ ( forgive my boldness ) banish from he little sullen brow , and all he _mamma_ rise to he eye . and when he musical tongue shall be unlocked to own he fault , and promise amendment -- of then ! how shall I clasp he to my bosom ! and tear of joy , I know , will meet he tear of penitence ! how these flight , dear , please a body ! - what delights have those mamma ( which some fashionable dear lady be quite unacquainted with ) who can make they baby , and they first educations , they entertainment and diversion ! to watch the dawning of reason in they , to direct they little passion , as they show themselves , to this or that particular point of benefit or use ; and to prepare the sweet virgin soil of they minds to receive the seed of virtue and goodness so early , that , as they grow up , one need only now a little pruning , and now a little water , to make they the ornament and delights of the garden of this life ! and then they pretty way , they fond and grateful endearment , some new beauty every day rise to observation -- of my dearest , whose enjoyment and pleasure be so great , as those of such mother as can bend they mind two or three hour every day to the duty of the nursery ? I have a few other thing to observe upon 's treatise , which , when I have do , I shall read , admire , and improve by the rest , as my year and experience advance ; of which , in my propose little book , I shall give you better proof than I be able to do at present ; raw , crude , and indigest as the notion of so young a mamma must need be . but these shall be the subject of another letter ; for now I be come to the pride and the pleasure I always have , when I subscribe myself , dearest Sir , _your ever dutiful and grateful_ P.B. , give a great many very pretty instruction relate to the play - game of child : but I humbly presume to object to what he say in one or two place . he would not indulge they in any plaything , but what they make themselves , or
or endeavou to make . " a smooth pebble , a piece of paper , the mother 's bunch of key , or any thing they can not hurt themselves with , " he rightly say , " serve as much to divert little child , as those more chargeable and curiious toy from the shop , which be presently put out of order , and break . " these plaything may certainly do for little one : but methink , to a person of easy circumstance , since the make these toy employ the industrious poor , the buy they for the child might be comply with , though they _were_ easily break ; and especially as they be of all price , and some less costly , and more durable than other . " top , gig , battledore , " obserf , " which be to be use with labour , should indeed be procure they -- not for variety , but exercise ; but if they have a top , the scourge - stick and leather strap should be left to they own making and fitting . " but I may presume to say , that whatever be the good Locke propose by this , it can not be equal to the mischief child may do themselves in make these plaything ! for must they not have implement to work with ? and be not a knife , or other ed tool , without which it be impossible they can make or shape a scourge - stick , or _any of they plaything , a fine instrument in a child 's hand ! this advice be the reverse of the caution warrante from all antiquity , that it be dangerous to meddle with edged tool !_ and I be afraid , the tutor must often act the surgeon , and follow the indulgence with a styptic and plaister ; and the young gentleman 's hand might be so often bound up as to be one way to cure he of he earnest desire to play ; but I can hardly imagine any other good that it can do he ; for I doubt the excellent consequence propose by we author from this doctrine , such as to teach the child moderation in he desire , application , industry , think , contrivance , and good husbandry , quality that , as he say , will be useful to he when he be a man , be too remote to be ingraft upon such beginning ; although it must be confess , that , as wisely observe , good habit and industry can not be too early inculcate . but then , , may I ask , be not the very play and sport , to which child accustom themselves , whether they make they own plaything or not , equivalent to the work or labour of grow persons ! yes , , I will venture to say , they be , and more than equivalent to the exercise and labour of many . advise , that the child 's plaything should be as few as possible , which I entirely approve : that they should be in he tutor 's power , who be to give he but one at once . but since it be the nature of the human mind to court most what be prohibit , and to set light by what be in its own power ; I be half doubtful ( only that say it , and it may not be so very important as other point , in which I have venture to differ from that gentleman ) , whether the child 's absolute possession of he own plaything in some little repository , of which he may be permit to keep the key , especially if he make no bad use of the privilege , would not make he more indifferent to they : while the contrary conduct might possibly enhance he value of they . and if , when he have do with any plaything , he be oblige to put it into its allotted place , and be accustom to keep account of the number and place of they severally ; this would teach he order , and at the same time instruct he to keep a proper account of they , and to avoid be a squanderer or waster : and if he should omit to put he plaything in they place , or be careless of they , the take they away for a time , or threaten to give they to other , would make he the more heedful . say , that he have know a child so distract with the number and variety of he plaything , that he ti he maid every day to look they over : and be so accustom to abundance , that he never think he have enough , but be always ask , " what more ? what new thing shall I have ? " --" a good introduction , " add he , ironically , " to moderate desire , and the ready way to make a contente happy man . " all that I shall offer to this , be , that few _men_ be so philosophical as one would wish they to be , much less _child _. but , no doubt , this variety engage the child 's activity ; which , of the two might be turn to better purpose than sloth or indolence ; and if the maid be tired , it might be , because she be not so much _alive as the child ; and perhaps this part of the grievance might not be so great , because if she be he attendant , ' ttis probable she have nothing else to do . however , in the main , as say , it be no matter how few
few plaything the child be indulge with ; but yet I can hardly persuade myself , that plenty of they can have such bad consequence as he apprehend ; and the rather , because they will excite he attention , and promote he industry and activity . he enquiry after new thing , let he have few or many , be to be expect as a consequence to those natural desire which be implant in he , and will every day increase : but this may be observe , that as he grow in year , he will be above some plaything , and so the number of the old one will be always reducible , perhaps in a greater proportion , than the new one will increase . on the head of good - breeding , he observe , that , " there be two sort of ill - breed ; the one a sheepish bashfulness , and the other a misbecoming negligence and disrespect in we carriage ; both which , " say he , " be avoid by duly observe this one rule , not to think meanly of ourselves , and not to think meanly of other . " I think , as explain this rule , it be a excellent one . but I would beg to observe upon it , that however discommendable a bashful temper be , in some instance , where it must be deem a weakness of the mind , yet , in my humble opinion , it be generally the mark of a ingenuous one , and be always to be prefer to a undistinguishing and hardy confidence , which , as it seem to I , be the genuine production of invincible ignorance . what be faulty in it , which he call _sheepishness , should indeed be shake off as soon as possible , because it be a enemy to merit in its advancement in the world : but , , be I to choose a companion for you , as he grow up , I should not think the worse of the youth , who , not have have the opportunity of knowing man , or see the world , have this defect . on the contrary , I should be apt to look upon it as a outward fence or inclosure to he virtue , which might keep off the lighter attack of immorality , the of vice , as I may say , who be not able to carry on a formal siege against he moral ; and I should expect such a one to be docile , humane , good - humoured , diffident of himself , and therefore most likely to improve as well in mind as behaviour : while a harden mind , that never doubt itself , must be a stranger to its own infirmity , and suspect none , be impetuous , over -bearing , incorrigible ; and , if rich , a tyrant ; if not , possibly a invader of other man 's property ; or at least , such a one as allow itself to walk so near the border of injustice , that where _self be concerned , it hardly ever do right thing . propose ( section 148 ) a very pretty method to cheat child , as it be , into learn : but then he add , " there may be dice and plaything , with the letter on they , to teach child the alphabet by play . " and ( section 151 ) " I know a person of great quality , who , by paste on the six vowel ( for in we language _y_ be one ) on the six side of a dice , and the remain eighteen consonant on the side of three other dice , have make this a play for he child , that _he_ shall win , who at one cast throw most word on these four dice ; whereby he eldest son , yet in coat , have _play himself _into spelling_ with great eagerness , and without once have be chid for it , or force to it . " but I have rather you should be a twelvemonth backwarder for want of this method , than forward by it . for what may not be fear from so early inculcat the use of dice and game , upon the mind of child ? let Locke himself speak to this in he section 208 , and I wish I could reconcile the two passage in this excellent author . " as to card and dice , " say he , " I think the safest and best way be , never to learn any play upon they , and so to be incapacitate for these dangerous temptation , and encroach waster of useful time . " and , he might have add , of the noblest estate and fortune ; while sharper and scoundrel have be lift into distinction upon they ruin . yet , in 153 , proceed to give direction in relation to the dice he recommend . but after all , if some innocent play be fix upon to cheat child into reading , that , as he say , should look as little like a task as possible , it must need be of use for that purpose . but let every gentleman , who have a fortune to lose , and who , if he game , be on a foot with the vilest company , who generally have nothing at all to risque , tremble at the thought of teaching he son , though for the most laudable purpose , the early use of dice and gaming . but how much I be charme with a hint in , which make you hope , she may be of greater use to you child , even as they
they _grow up , than she could ever have flatter herself to be . ' tTis a charming paragraph ; I must not skip one word of it . thus it begin , and I will observe upon it as I go along . sec. 177 : " but under whose care soever a child be put to be teach , during the tender and flexible year of he life , this be certain , it should be one who think and language the least part of education . " how agreeable be this to my notions ; which I durst not have avow , but after so excellent a scholar ! for I have long have the thought , that much time be waste to little purpose in the attaining of . , I think , say he be ten year in endeavouring to learn it , and , as far as I can find , know nothing at all of the matter neither !-- indeed he lay that to the wicked picture in he grammar , which he take for grant ( as he have often say , as well as once write ) be put there to teach boy to rob orchard , instead of improve they mind in learning , or common honesty . but ( for this be too light a instance for the subject ) proceed --" one who know how much virtue and a well - tempered soul be to be prefer to any sort of _learning or language , " [ what a noble writer be this !_] " make it he chief business to form the mind of he scholar , and give that a right disposition : " [ _Ay , there , dear Sir , be the thing !_] " which , if once get , though all the rest should be neglect , " [ _charmingly observe !_] " would , in _due time , " [ _without wicked dice , I hope !_ ] " produce all the rest ; and which , if it be not get and settled , so to keep out ill and vicious habit , _language and _science , and all the other accomplishment of education , will be to no purpose , but to make the worse or more dangerous man . " [ now come the place I be so much delighted with !_] " and indeed , whatever stir there be make about get of , as the great and difficult business , he mother " [ thank you , dear Sir , for put this excellent author into my hand !_] " may teach it he herself , if she will but spend two or three hour in a day with he , " [ if she will ! never fear , but I will , with the highest pleasure in the world !_ ] " and make he read the in to she . " [ how I long to be five or six year older , as well as my dearest baby , that I may enter upon this charming scheme !_ ] " for she need but buy a testament , and have get somebody to mark the last syllable but one , where it be long , in word above two syllable ( which be enough to regulate she pronunciation and accente the word ) , read daily in the Gospels , and then let she avoid understand they in , if she can . " why , dear Sir , you have teach I almost all this already ; and you , my beloved tutor , have tell I often , I read and pronounce latin more than tolerably , though I do not understand it : but this method will teach _me_ , as well as you dear _children_-- but thus the good gentleman proceed -- " and when she understand the in , let she in the same manner read 's Fables , and so proceed on to , , and such other book . I do not mention this , " add , " as a imagination of what I fancy _may do , but as of a thing I have know do , and the Latin tongue get with ease this way . " he then mention other advantage , which the child may receive from he mother 's instruction , which I will try more and more to qualify myself for : particularly , after he have intimate , that " at the same time that the child be learn French and latin , he may be enter also in arithmetic , geography , chronology , history , and geometry too ; for if , " say he , " these be teach he in or , when he begin once to understand either of these tongue , he will get a knowledge of these sciences , and the language to boot . " he then proceed : " Geography , I think , should be begin with : for the learning of the figure of the globe , the situation and boundary of the four part of the world , and that of particular kingdom and country , be only a exercise of the eyes and memory , a child with pleasure will learn and retain they . and this be so certain , that I now live in a house with a child , whom he mother have so well instruct this way in geography , " [ but _have she not , do you think , dear Sir , some of this good gentleman 's kind assistance ?_] " that he know the limit of the four part of the world ; would readily point , be ask , to any country upon the globe , or any county in the map of ; kknow all the great rivers , promontory , streight , and bay
bay in the world , and could find the longitude and latitude of any place , before he be six year old . " there be for you , dear Sir !-- see what a mother can do if she pleasis ! I remember , , formerly , in that sweet chariot conference , at the dawning of my hope , when all my dangers be happily over ( a conference I shall always think of with pleasure ) , that you ask I , how I would bestow my time , suppose the neighbouring lady would be above be see in my company ; when I should have no visit to receive or return ; no party of pleasure to join in ; no card - table to employ my winter evening ? I then , , transport with my opening prospects , prattle to you , how well I would try to pass my time , in the family management and account , in visit now and then to the indigent and worthy poor ; in music sometimes ; in read , in writing , in my superior duty -- and I hope I have not behave quite unworthily of my promise . but I also remember , what once you say on a certain occasion , which _now , since the fair prospect be no longer distant , and that I have be so long you happy wife , I may repeat without those blush which then cover my face ; thus then , with a _modest_ , and with that _virtuous endearment that be so _beautiful_ in _your_ sex , as well as in _our , whether in the character of lover or husband , maiden or wife , you be pleased to say -- " and I hope , my , to have superad to all these , such a employment as -- " in short , , I be now bless with , and write of ; no less than the useful part I may be able to take in the first education of you beloved baby ! and now I must add , that this pleasing hope set I above all other diversion : I wish for no party of pleasure but with you , my dearest , and these be party that will improve I , and make I more capable of the other , and more worthy of you conversation , and of the time you pass ( beyond what I could ever have promise to my utmost wish ) in such poor company as mine , for no other reason but because I love to be instruct , and take my lesson well , as you be pleased to say ; and indeed I must be a sad dunce , if I do not , from so skilful and so belove a master . I want no card - table amusement ; for I hope , in a few year ( and a proud hope it be ) , to be able to teach you dear little one the first rudiment , as point the way , of , of french , and of geography , and arithmetic . o , my dear , by you help and countenance , what may I not be able to teach they , and how may I prepare the way for a tutor 's instruction , and give he up mind half cultivate to he hand ! -- and all this time improve myself too , not only in science , but in nature , by tracing in the little babe what all mankind be , and have be , from infancy to riper year , and watch the sweet dawning of reason , and delighte in every bright emanation of that ray of divinity , lent to the human mind , for great and happy purpose , when rightly point and direct . there be no go farther after these charming recollection and hope , for they bring I to that grateful remembrance , to whom , under , I owe they all , and also what I have be for so happy a period , and what I be , which will ever be my pride and my glory ; and well it may , when I look back to my beginning with humble acknowledgment , and can call myself , dearest , _you honoure and honour , and , I hope to say , in time , useful wife , my , have in my former letter say as much as be necessary to let you into my notion of the excellent book you put into my hand , and have touch those point in which the child of both sex may be concerned ( with some _art in my intention , I own ) , in hope that they would not be so much out of the way , as to make you repent of the honour you have do I , in commit the dear to my care ; I shall now very quickly set myself about the propose little book . you have be so good as to tell I ( at the same time that you disapprove not these my specimen letter as I may call they ) , that you will kindly accept of my intend present , and encourage I to proceed in it ; and as I shall leave one side of the leaf blank for you correction and alteration , those correction will be a fine help and instruction to I in the pleasing task which I propose to myself , of assisting in the early education of you dear child . and as I may be year in write it , as the dear baby improve , as I myself improve , by the opportunity which they advance in year will give I , and the experience I shall gain , I
I may then venture to give my notion on the more material and nobler part of education , as well as the inferior : for ( but that I think the subject above my present ability ) 's book would lead I into several remark , that might not be unuseful , and which appear to I entirely new ; though that may be owe to my slender reading and opportunity , perhaps . but what I would now touch upon , be a word or two still more particularly upon the education of my own sex ; a topic which naturally arise to I from the subject of my last letter . for there , dear , we see , that the mother might teach the child _this part of science , and that part of instruction ; and who , I pray , as we sex be generally educated , shall teach the _mother ? how , in a word , shall _they come by they knowledge ? I know you will be apt to say , that give all the promise of become a fine young lady , and take she learn , love reading , and make very pretty reflection upon all she read , and ask very pertinent question , and be as know , at she year , as most young lady . this be very true , ; but it be not every one that can boast of 's capacity , and goodness of temper , which have enable she to get up a good deal of _lost_ time , as I must call it ; for she first four year be a perfect blank , as far as I can find , just as if the pretty dear be bear the day she be four year old ; for what she have to _unlearn_ as to temper , and will , and such thing , set against what little improvement she have make , might very fairly be compound for , as a blank . I would indeed have a girl bring up to she needle , but I would not have _all_ she time employ in sampler , and learn to , and do those unnecessary thing , which she will never , probably , be call upon to practise . and why , pray , be not girl entitle to the same _first_ education , though not to the same play and diversion , as boy ; so far , at least , as be suppose by a mother can instruct they ? would not this lay a foundation for they future improvement , and direct they inclination to useful subject , such as would make they above the imputation of some unkind gentleman , who allot to they part common tea - table prattle , while they do all they can to make they fit for nothing else , and then upbraid they for it ? and would not the man find we better and more suitable companion and assistant to they in every useful purpose of life ?--o that you lordly sex be all like my dear .-- I do not mean that they should all take raw , uncouth , unbred , lowly girl , as I be , from the cottage , and , destroy all distinction , make such they wives ; for there be a far greater likelihood , that such a one , when she come to be lift up into so dazzl a sphere , would have she head make giddy with she exaltation , than that she would balance herself well in it : and to what a blot , over all the fair page of a long life , would this little drop of dirty ink spread itself ! what a stand disreputation to the choice of a gentleman ! but _this_ I mean , that after a gentleman have enter into the marriage state with a young creature ( say nothing at all of birth or descent ) far inferior to he in learn , in part , in knowledge of the world , and in all the graces which make conversation agreeable and improve , he would , as you do , endeavou to make she fit company for himself , as he shall find she be _will to improve , and _capable of improvement : that he would direct she taste , point out to she proper subject for she amusement and instruction ; travel with she now and then , a month in a year perhaps ; and show she the world , after he have encourage she to put herself forward at he own table , and at the house of he friend , and have see , that she will not do he great discredit any where . what obligation , and opportunity too , will this give she to love and honour such a husband , every hour , more and more ! as she will see he wisdom in a thousand instance , and experience he indulgence to she in ten thousand , to the praise of he politeness , and the honour of they both ! -- and then , when select party of pleasure or business engage he not abroad , in he home conversation , to have he delight to instruct and open she view , and inspire she with a ambition to enlarge she mind , and more and more to ! what a intellectual kind of married life would such person find theirs ! and how suitable to the rule of policy and self - live in the gentleman ; for be not the wife , and be not she improvement , all t_his own _?--_absolutely_, as I may say , t_his own ? and do not every excellence she can be adorn by , redound to she husband 's honour because she be he , even more
more than to _her own _!-- in like manner as no dishonour affect a man so much , as that which he receive from a bad wife . but where be such a gentleman as to be meet with ? look round and see where , with all the advantages of sex , of education , of travel , of conversation in the open world , a gentleman of he ability to instruct and inform , be to be find ? and there be other , who , perhaps , will question the capacity or inclination of we sex in general , to improve in useful knowledge , be they to meet with such kind instructors , either in the character of parent or husband . as to the first , I grant , that it be not easy to find such a gentleman : but for the second ( if excusable in I , who be one of the sex , and so may be think partial to it ) , I could by comparison draw from the gentleman and lady within the circle of my own acquaintance , produce instance , which be so flagrantly in they favour , as might make it suspect , that it be policy more than justice , in those who would keep we sex unacquainted with that more eligible turn of education , which give the gentleman so many advantage over we in _that ; and which will show , they have none at all in _nature_ or _genius _. I know you will pardon I , dear Sir ; for you be so exalt above you , by nature and education too , that you can not apprehend any inconvenience from bold comparison . I will beg , therefore , to mention a few instance among we friend , where the lady , notwithstand they more cramp and confin education , make _more_ than a equal figure with the gentleman in all the graceful part of conversation , in spite of the contempt pour out upon we sex by some witty gentleman , whose writing I have in my eye . to begin then with , and that be ; have the reputation of scholarship , and have travel too ; but how infinitely be he surpass in every noble and useful quality , and in greatness of mind , and judgment , as well as wit , by the young lady I have name ! this we see , when last at the , in fifty instance , where the gentleman be , you know , , on a visit to and he lady . next , dear Sir , permit I to observe , that my good Davers , with all he advantage , bear a counsellor of the realm , and educate accordingly , do not surpass he lady . My_ countess , as I delight to call she , and , she eldest daughter , greatly surpass the and she eldest brother in every point of knowledge , and even learn , as I may say , although both lady owe that advantage principally to they own cultivation and acquirement . let I presume , , to name h.: and when I _have name he , shall we not be puzzl to find any where in we sex , one remove from vulgar life , a woman that will not out - do .? , upon all useful subject , make a much brighter figure than , whose knowledge of the world have not yet make he acquaint with himself .-- yoArthu excel not he lady . , a maiden lady , be a over -match for half a dozen of the neighbour gentleman I could name , in what be call wit and politeness , and not inferior to any of they in judgment . I could multiply such instance , be it needful , to the confutation of that low , and I have almost say , _unmanly contempt , with which a certain celebrated genius treat we sex in general in most of he piece , I have see ; particularly he of advice to a new married ; so write , as must disgust , instead of instruct ; and look more like the advice of a enemy to the _sex_ , and a bitter one too , than a friend to the _particular lady _. but I ought to beg pardon for this my presumption , for two reason : first , because of the truly admirable talents of this writer ; and next , because we know not what lady the ingenious gentleman may have fall among in he younger day . upon the whole , therefore , I conclude , that be almost the only gentleman , who excel _every lady that I have see ; so _greatly excels , that even the emanation of he excellence irradiate a low cottage - bear girl , and make she pass among lady of birth and education for somebody . forgive my pride , dear Sir ; but it would be almost a crime in you not to exult in the mild benignity of those ray , by which she belov endeavour to make she look up to he own sunny sphere : while she , by the advantage only of he reflect glory , in _his_ absence , which make a dark night to she , glide along with she paler and fainter beaminess , and make a distinguishing figure among such lesser planets , as can only poorly twinkle and glimmer , for want of the aid she boast of . I dare not , Sir , conjecture whence arise this more than parity in the genius of the sex , among the above person , notwithstand the disparity of education , and the difference in the opportunity of each . this might lead one into too proud a thought in
in favour of a sex too contemptuously treat by some _other_ wit I could name , who , indeed , be the less to be regard , as they love to jest upon all 's work : yet might I better do it , too , than anybody , since I be so infinitely transcend by my husband , that no competition , pride or vanity , could be apprehend from I . but , however , I would only beg off those who be so free in they contempt of we , that they would , for _they own sake ( and that , with such generally go a great way ) , rather try to _improve_ than _depreciate_ we : we should then make better daughter , better wife , better mother , and better mistress : and who ( permit I , , to ask they ) would be so much the better for these opportunity and amendment , as we upbraider themselves ! on re-peruse this , I must repeatedly beg you excuse for these proud notion in behalf of my sex , which , I can truly say , be not owe to partiality because , I have the honour to be one of it ; but to a far better motive ; for what do this contemptuous treatment of one half , if not the better half , of the human species , naturally produce , but libertinism and abandoned wickedness ? for do it not tend to make the daughter , the sister , the wife of gentleman , the subject of profligate attempt ?-- do it not render the sex vile in the eyes of the most vile ? and when a lady be no longer beheld by such person with that dignity and reverence , with which perhaps , the graces of she person , and the innocence of she mind , should sacredly , as it be , encompass she , do not she very excellency become so many incentife for base wretch to attempt she virtue , and bring about she ruin ? what then may not wick wit have to answer for , when its possessor prostitute it to such unmanly purpose ! and as if they have never have a mother , a sister , a daughter of they own , throw down , as much as in they lie , those sacred fence which may lay the fair inclosure open to the invasion of every clumsier and viler beast of prey ; who , though destitute of _their_ win , yet corrupt by it , shall fill they mouths , as well as they heart , with the borrowed mischief , and propagate it from one to another to the end of time ; and who , otherwise , would have pass by the uninvaded fence , and only shew they tooth , and snarl at the well secure fold within it ? you can not , my dearest , I know be angry at this romantic painting : since you be not affect by it : for when at worst , you act ( more dangerously , ' tis true , for the poor innocent ) a _principal_ part , and be as a lion among beasts -- , dear Sir , let I say _among , this one time -- you scorn to borrow any man 's wit ; and if nobody have follow you example , till they have have you qualitie , the number of rake would have be but small . yet , do not mistake I , neither ; I be not so mean as to bespeak you favour by extenuat you failings ; if I _were , you would deservedly despise I . for , undoubtedly ( I _must say it , ) , you fault be the greater for you perfection : and such talents misapply , as they make you more capable of mischief , so do they increase the evil of you practice . all then that I mean by say you be not affect by this painting , be , that you be not affect by my description of clumsy and sordid rake , whose _wit_ be _borrow , and they _wickedness only what they may call _they own . then , dear , since that noble conversation you hold with I at , in relation to the consequence that might , have it not be for 's grace intervene , have follow the masquerade affair , I have the inexpressible pleasure to find a thorough reformation , from the _best_ motive , take place ; and you join with I in my closet ( as opportunity permit ) in my evening duty , be the charming confirmation of you kind and voluntary , and I be proud to say , _pious assurance ; so that this make I fearless of you displeasure , while I rather triumph in my joy for you precious soul 's sake , than presume to think of recriminating ; and when ( only for this once ) I take the liberty of look back from the delightful _now , to the painful _formerly !_ but , what a rambler be I again ! you command I to write to you all I think , without fear . I obey , and , as the phrase be , do it without either _fear_ or _wit_ . if you be not_ displease , it be a mark of the true nobleness of you nature , and the sincerity of you late pious declaration . if you _are , I shall be sure I have do wrong in have apply a corrosive to eat away the _proud flesh of a _wound , that be not yet so thoroughly _digest , as to bear a painful application , and require balsam and a gentler treatment . but when we be at , I remember
remember what you say once of the benefit of retrospection : and you charge I , whenever a _proper_ opportunity offer , to remind you , by that one word , _retrospection , of the charming conversation we have there , on we return from the room . if this be not one of they , forgive , dearest , the unreasonableness of you very impertinent , but , in intention and resolution , _ever dutiful , from to she father and mother_ ever , and ever Honoured , I must write this one letter , although I have have the happiness to see you so lately ; because be now about to honour I with the tour he so kindly promise ; and it may therefore be several month , perhaps , before I have again the pleasure of pay you the like dutiful respects . you know he kind promise , that he would for every dear baby I present he with , take a excursion with I afterwards , in order to establish and confirm my health . the task I have undertaken of dedicating all my writing amusement to the dearest of man ; the full employment I have , when at home ; the frequent ramble he have so often indulge I in , with my dear , to , , , , and to my lady Davers , take from I the necessity of writing to you , to my that be , and to Lady Davers , so often as I formerly think myself oblige to do , when I see all my worthy friend so seldom ; the same thing , moreover , with little variation , occur this year , as to we conversation , visit , friend , employment , and amusement , that fall out the last , as must be the case in a family so uniform and methodical as ours . I have for these reason , more leisure to pursue my domestic duty , which be increase upon I ; and when I have say , that I be every day more and more happy in my beloved , in , my , my Davers , and now , newly , in my sweet little ( for so , you know , would have she call , rather than by she own name ) , what can I say more ? as to the tour I speak of , you know , the first part of . oblige scheme be to carry I to ; for he have already travel with I over the greatest part of ; and I be sure , by my passage last year , to the of , I shall not be afraid of cross the water from thither ; and he will , when we be at , he say , take _my farther direction ( that be he kind expression ) whither to go next . my and be so good as to promise to accompany we to , provide . will give they we company to - - , for a month or six week , whither my lord be advise to go . and if he can get over he fear of cross the salt water , be to be of the party . , that be ( who likewise have lately lain - in of a fine daughter ) , and I , be to correspond as opportunity offer ; and she promise to send you what I write , as formerly : but I have refuse to say one word in my letter of the manners , custom , curiosity , & c. of the place we see ; because , first , I shall not have leisure ; and , next , those thing be so much better describe in book write by person who make stricter and better observation that I can pretend to make : so that what I shall write will relate only to we private self , and be as brief as possible . if we be to do as . have it in he thought , he intend to be out of two year :-- but how can I bear that , if for you sake only , and for those of my dear baby ! -- but this must be my time , my _only time , say , to ramble and see distant place and country ; for as soon as he little one be capable of my instruction , and begin to understand my look and sign , he will not spare I from they a week together ; and he be so kind as to propose , that my dear bold boy ( for every one see how greatly he resemble he papa in he dear forward spirit ) shall go with we ; and this pleasis highly , who be very fond of _him , and my little Daver ; but vow she will never love so well my pretty black - ey . you see what a sweet girl miss be , and you admire she much : do I tell you , what she say to I , when first she see you both , with you silver hair , and reverend countenance ?--" madam , I dare say , you papa , and mamma , _honoure they father and mother _:" --" they do , my dear ; but what be you reason for say so ? " --" because _they have liv so long in the land which the Lord they have give they _. " I take the charmer in my arm , and kiss she three or four time , as she deserv ; for be not this very pretty in the child ? I must , with inexpressible pleasure , write you word how happily 's providence have now , at last , turn that affair , which
which once make I so uneasy , in relation to the fine Countess ( who have be some time abroad ) , of whom you have hear , as you tell I , some report , which , have you know at the time , would have make you very apprehensive for . moral , as well as for my repose . I will now ( because I can do it with the highest pleasure , by reason of the event it have produce ) , explain that dark affair so far as shall make you judge of my present joy : although i have hithertoo avoid enter into that subject to you . for now I think myself , by 's , secure to the affection and fidelity of the best of husband , and that from the worthiest motive ; as you shall hear . there be but one thing want to complete all the happiness I wish for in this life ; which be , the remote hope I have entertained , that one day , my dear who from a licentious gentleman become a moralist , would be so touch by the divine grace , as to become in time , more than moral , a religious man , and , at last , join in the duty which he have the goodness to countenance . for this reason I begin with mere _indispensable . I crowd not he gate with object of charity : I visit they at they home , and relieve they ; distinguish the worthy indigent ( make so by unavoidable accident and casualty ) from the wilfully , or perversely , or sottishly such , by _greater_ mark of my favour . I confin my morning and evening devotion to my own private closet , lest I should give offence and discouragement to so gay a temper , so unaccustomed ( poor gentleman ! ) to act of devotion and piety ; whilst I meet he household together , only on morning and evening of the - day , to prepare they for they public duty in the one , and in hope to confirm they in what they have hear at church in the other ; leave they to they own reflection for the rest of the week ; after I have suggest a method I wish they to follow , and in which they constantly oblige I . this good order have its desired effect , and we Sabbath - day assemblie be hold with so little parade , that we be hardly any of we miss . all , in short , be done with cheerful ease and composure : and every one of we be better dispose to we domestic duty : I , to attend the good pleasure of my best friend ; and they , that of we both . thus we go on very happily , my neighbourly visit of charity , take up no more time than common airing , and pass many of they for such ; my private duty be only between my first , my , and myself , and my family one personally confin to the day separate for these best of service , and pleas with my manner beheld the good effect , and countenance I by he praise and he endearment , as act discreetly , as not fall into enthusiasm , and ( as he use to say ) as not aim at be _righteous overmuch _. but still I want , and wait for , with humble patience , and make it part of my constant prayer , that the divine would at last touch he heart , and make he _more_ than a countenancer , _more_ than a applauder of my duty ; that he might for he own dear sake , become a partaker in they . " and then , " think I , " when we can , hand in hand , heart in heart , one spirit as well as one flesh , join in the same closet , in the same prayer and thanksgive , what a happy creature shall I be . " I say , _closet : for I durst not aspire so high , as to hope the favour of he company among he servants , in we devotion .-- I know it would be go too far , in _his_ opinion , to expect it from he . in _me_ they mistress , have I be ever so high - bear , it be not amiss , because I , and they , _every one of we , be _he ; I in one degree , in another , in another -- but from a man of he high temper and manner of education , I know I could never hope for it , so would not lose _every thing , by grasp at too much _. but in the midst of all these comfortable proceedings , and my further charming hope , a nasty masquerade throw into he way a temptation , which for a time blast all my prospect , and indeed make I doubt my own head almost . for , judge my disappointment , when I find all my wish frustrate , all my prayer render ineffectual ; he very morality , which I have flatter myself , in time , I should be a humble instrument to exal into religion , shock , and in danger ; and all the work to begin over again , if offend should ever again offer itself to the dear wilful trespasser ! but who should pretend to scrutinize the councils of the Almighty ? -- for out of all this _evil appearance_ be to proceed the _real good , I have be so long , and so often , supplicat for ! the dear man _was_ to be on the brink of relapse :
: it be proper , that I should be so very uneasy , as to assume a conduct not natural to my temper , and to raise he generous concern for I : and , in the very crisis , divine interpose , make he sensible of he danger , make he resolve against he error , before it be yet too late : and he slide foot , quit the slippery path he be in , collect new strength , and he stand the firmer and more secure for he peril . for have happily put a stop to that affair , and by he uniform conduct , for a considerable time , shew I that I have nothing to apprehend from it , he be pleased , when we be last at , and in very serious discourse upon divine subject , to say to this effect : " be there not , my , a text , that the unbelieving husband shall be save by the believe wife , whilst he behold she chaste conversation couple with fear ?_ " " I need not tell you , my dear , that there be , nor where it be . " " then , my dear , I begin to hope , _that will be my case ; for , from a former affair , of which this spot of ground put I more in mind , I see so much reason to doubt my own strength , which I have build , and , as I think securely , on _moral foundation , that I must look out for a _better_ guide to conduct I , than the proud word _honour_ can be , in the general acceptance of it among we lively young gentleman . " how often have I promise ( and I never promise but I intend to perform ) that I would be faithfully and only yours ! how often declare , that I do not think I could possibly deserve my Pamela , till I could show she , in my own mind , a purity as nearly equal to hers , as my past conduct would admit of ! " but I depend too much upon my own strength : and I be now convinced , that nothing but , and a resolution to watch over the very _first_ appearance of evil , and to check they as they arise , can be of sufficient weight to keep steady to he good purpose , a vain young man , too little accustom to restraint , and too much use to play upon the brink of danger , from a temerity , and love of intrigue , natural to enterprise mind . " I would not make this declaration of my conviction to you , till I have thoroughly examine myself , and have reason to hope , that I should be enable to make it good . and now , my , from this instant you shall be my guide ; and , only take care , that you do not , all at once , by injunction too rigorous , damp and discourage the rise flame , I will leave it to you to direct as you please , till , by degree , it may be deem worthy to mingle with you own . " judge how rapturous my joy be upon this occasion , and how ready I be to bless for a danger ( so narrowly escape ) which be attend with the _very consequence that I have so long pray for ; and which I little think the divine providence be bring about by the very means , that , I apprehend , would put a end to all my pleasing hope and prospects of that nature . it be in vain for I to seek word to express what I feel , and how I act , on this occasion . I hear he out with twenty different and impatient emotion ; and then throw myself at he foot , embrace he knee , with arm the most ardently clasp ! my face lift up to , and to he , by turn ; my eye overflow with tear of joy , which half chok up the passage of my word .-- at last , he kind arm clasp my neck , and kiss my tearful cheek , I could only say --" my ardent prayer , be at last - heard -- confirm you pious purpose ! and , oh I what a happy Pamela have you at you foot ! " I weep for joy till I sob again -- and he raise I to he kind arm , I say -- " to have this _heavenly prospect , of best beloved of my heart ! add to all my _earthly blessing !-- how shall I contain my joy ! -- for , oh ! to think that he be , and will be mine , and I he , through the mercy of , when this transitory life be past and gone , to all eternity ; what a rich thought be this !-- I be already , dear Sir , cease to be mortal , and begin to taste the perfection of those joy , which this thrice welcome declaration give I hope of hereafter ! -- but what shall I say , oblige as I be beyond expression before , and now doubly oblige in the rapturous view you have open to I , into a happy futurity ! " he say , he be delighte with I beyond expression ; that I be he ecstatic charmer !-- that the love I shew for he future good be the move proof of the purity of my heart , and my affection for he . and that very evening he join with I in my retired duty ; and , at all
all proper opportunity , favour I with he company in the same manner ; listen attentively to all my lesson , as he call my cheerful discourse on serious subject . and now , my dear parent , do you not rejoice with I in this charming , charme appearance ? for , _before_ I have the most generous , the most beneficent , the most noble , the most affectionate , but _now I be likely to have the most _pious , of husband ! what a happy wife , what a happy daughter , be _his_ and _your_ ! of he infinite mercy , continue and improve the ravishing prospect ! I be force to leave off here , to enjoy the charming reflection , which this lovely subject , and my bless prospect , fill I with ; and now proceed to write a few line more . I be under some concern on account of we go to travel into some country , for fear we should want the public opportunity of divine service : for I presume , the ambassador 's chapel will be the only Protestant place of worship allow of , and the only city in where there be one . but we must endeaavor to make it up in we private and domestic duty : for , as the phrase be -- " when we be at , we must do as they do at ; " that be to say , so far as not to give offence , on the one hand , to the people we be among ; nor scandal , on the other , by compliance hurtful to one 's conscience . but my protector know all these thing so well ( no place in what be call the grand tour , be new to he ) , that I have no reason to be very uneasy . and now let I , by letter , as I do on my knee at parting , beg the continuance of you prayer and blessing , and that will preserve we to one another , and give we , and all we worthy friend , a happy meeting again . , you may be sure , will be we first visit , on we return , for you sake , for my dear 's , and my little 's sake , who will be both put into you protection ; while my , and ( for , since I begin this letter , it be so determined ) , be to be my delightful companion ; for declare , he temper want look after , and he notice of every thing be strong and significant . poor little dear ! he have indeed a little sort of perverseness and headstrongness , as one may say , in he will : yet he be but a baby , and I hope to manage he pretty well ; for he notice all I say , and every look of mine already . -- he be , besides , very good humoured , and willing to part with anything for a kind word : and this give I hope of a docile and benevolent disposition , as he grow up . I think , when I begin the last paragraph but one , that I be within a line of concluding ; but it be _to_ you , and _on my baby , I be write ; so shall go on to the bottom of this new sheet , if I do not directly finish : which I do , with assure you both , that wherever I be , I shall always be thoughtful of you , and remember you in my prayer , as become _your ever dutiful daughter , P.b. my respects to all you good neighbour in general . will visit you now and then . will take one journey into , she say , and it shall be to accompany my baby , when carry down to you . poor , and she , good folk ! seem decline in they health , which grieve I .-- once more , send we all a happy meeting , if it be he bless will ! , adieu , my dear parent ! _your ever dutiful , &c._ my dear , I receive you last letter at , as we be dispose every thing for we return to , after a absence of near two year ; in which , as I have inform you , from time to time , I have be a great traveller , into , the , through the most considerable province of , into ; and , in we return to again ( the principal place of we residence ) , through several part of . I tell you of the favour and civility we receive at , from the then Countess Dowager of ----, who , with she humble servant ----( that have so assiduously attend she for so many month in ) , accompany we from to . she ladyship make that worthy lord happy in about a month after she part from we , and the noble pair give we a opportunity at , in they way to , to return some of the civility which we receive from they in ; and they be now arrive at she ladyship 's seat on the Forest . she lord be exceedingly fond of she , as he well ; for she be one of the most charming lady in ; and behave to he with so much prudence and respect , that they be as happy in each other as can be wish . and let I just add , that both in and at , . demeanour and she ladyship 's to one another , be so nobly open , and unaffectedly polite , as well as highly discreet , that
that neither who have once be jealous of . nor the _other party , who have have a tincture of the same yellow evil , as you know , because of the Countess , have so much as a shadow of uneasiness remain on the occasion . have have he health ( which have begin to decline in ) so well , that there be no persuading lady Davers to return before now , although I beg and praye I might not have another little , for fear they should , as they grow up , forget , as I pleasantly use to say , the obligation which they parentage lay they under to dearer . and now , my dearest friend , I have shut up my ramble for my whole life ; for three little English folk , and one little ( but a charming baby as well as the rest , by name ) , and a near prospect of a further increase , you will say , be family enough to employ all my care at home . I have tell you , from time to time , although I could not write to you so often as I would , because of we be constantly in motion , what be most worthy of you knowledge relate to every particular , and how happy we all have be in one another . and I have the pleasure to confirm to you what I have often write , that and my and Lady Davers be all that I could wish and hope for , with regard to they first duty . we be indeed a happy family , unit by the best and most solid tie ! be a charming young lady !-- I can not express how much I love she . she be a perfect mistress of the french language and speak italian very prettily ! and , as to myself , I have improve so well under my dear tutor 's lesson , together with the opportunity of conversing with the politest and most learn gentry of different nation , that I will discourse with you in two or three language , if you please , when I have the happiness to see you . there be a learn boaster for you , my dear friend ! ( if the knowledge of different language make one learn .) -- but I shall bring you a heart as entirely as ever , for all that ! we land on last at , and direct we course to the dear farm - house ; and you can better imagine , than I express , we meeting with my dear father and mother , and my beloved Daver and , who be charme baby . -- but be not this the language of every fond mamma ? be highly delighted now with my sweet little , and say , she shall be she sister indeed ! " for , , " say she , " be a beauty !-- and we see no french beautie like master Davers and . " --" ! my dear , " say I ; " what be beauty , if she be not a good girl ? beauty be but a specious , and , as it may happen , a dangerous recommendation , a mere skin - deep perfection ; and if , as she grow up , she be not as good as , she shall be none of my girl . " what add to my pleasure , my dear friend , be to see they both so well get over the small - pox . it have be as happy for they , as it be for they mamma and she , that they have it under so skilful and kind a manager in that distemper , as my dear mother . I wish if it please , it be as happily over with my little pretty . every body be surprised to see what the past two year have do for and my .-- o , my dear friend , they be both of they almost -- nay , quite , I think , for they year , all that I wish they to be . in order to make they keep they French , which miss so well speak , and Billy so prettily prattle , I oblige they , when they be in the nursery , to speak nothing else : but at table , except on particular occasion , when french may be speak , they be to speak in ; that be , when they do speak : for I tell they , that little master must only ask question for information , and say --" yes , " or -- " no , " till they papa or mamma permit they to speak ; nor little lady neither , till they be sixteen ; for -- " my dear love , " cry I , " you would not speak before you know _how ; and knowledge be obtain by _hearing , and not by _speaking _. " and set my on my lap , in 's presence -- " here , " say I , take a ear in the finger of each hand , " be two ear , my , " and then , point to he mouth , " but one tongue , my love ; so you must be sure to mind that you _hear_ twice as much as you _speak , even when you grow a bigger master than you be now . " " you have so many pretty way to learn one , madam , " say , now and then , " that it be impossible we should not regard what you say to we ! " several french tutor , when we be abroad , be recommend to . but there be
be one English gentleman , now on he travels with young with whom . have agree ; and in the mean time , my best friend be pleased to compliment I , that the child will not suffer for want of a tutor , while I can take the pain I do : which he will have to be too much for I : especially that now , on we return , my Daver and my Pamela be add to my car . but what mother can take too much pain to cultivate the mind of she child ? -- if , my dear , it be not for these _frequent_ lyings - in ! -- but this be the time of life .-- though little do I think , so early , I should have so many careful blessing ! I have as great credit as pleasure from my little family . all we neighbour here admire we more and more . you will excuse my seem ( for it be but see ) vanity : I hope I know better than to have it real -- " never , " say , who be still a single lady , " do I see , before , a lady so much advantage by she residence in that fantastic nation " ( for she love not the french ) " who bring home with she nothing of they affectation ! " -- she say , that the french politeness , and the english frankness and plainness of heart , appear happily blend in all we say and do . and she make I a thousand compliment upon and 's account , who , she would fain persuade I , owe a great deal of improvement ( my lord in he conversation , and my lady in she temper ) to live in the same house with we . my be exceed kind and good to I , be always magnify I to every body , and say she know not how to live from I : and that I have be a means of save half a hundred soul , as well as she dear brother 's . on a indisposition of my 's at , which make she very apprehensive , she declare , that be she to be deprive of he lordship , she would not let we rest till we have consent to she live with we ; say that we have room enough in , and she would enlarge the seat at she own expense . be still ; and that be the best I can say of he ; for I verily think , he be more of a ape than ever . he _whole_ head be now french . ' so before . we have great difficulty with he abroad : he aunt and I endeavour to give he a serious and religious turn , we have like to have turn he into a . for he be much pleased with the shewy part of that religion , and the fine picture , and decoration in the churche of ; and have get into company with a at , a at , and a Jesuit at , they lay so hard at he , in they turn , that we have like to have lose he to each assailant : so be force to let he take he own course ; for , he aunt would have it , that he have no other defence from the attack of person to make he embrace a faulty religion , than to permit he to continue as he be ; that be to say , to have none at all . so she suspend attempt to proselyte the thoughtless creature , till he come to . I wish she success here : but , I doubt , he will not be a credit to any religion , for a great while . and as he be very desirous to go to , it will be find , when there , that any fluttering coxcomb will do more to make he one of that class , in a hour , than he aunt 's lesson , to make he a good man , in a twelvemonth . " where much be give , much be require _. " the contrary of this , I doubt , be all poor . have to trust to . we have just now hear that he father , who have be long ill , be dead . so now , he be a lord indeed ! he flutter and start about most strangely , I warrant , and be wholly employ in give direction as to he mourning equipage . -- and now there will be no hold he in , I doubt ; except he new title have so much virtue in it , as to make he a wiser and better man . he will now have a seat in the house of Peers of Great ; but I hope , for the nation 's sake , he will not find many more like himself there ! -- for , to I , that be one of the most venerable assemblie in the world ; and it appear the more so , since I have be abroad ; for a english gentleman be respecte , if he be any thing of a man , above a foreign nobleman ; and a english nobleman above some petty sovereign . if we travel gentry duly consider this distinction in they favour , they would , for the honour of they country , as well as for they own credit , behave in a better manner , in they foreign tours , than , I be sorry to say , some of they do . but what can one expect from the unlicked cub ( pardon the term ) send abroad with only
only stature , to make they look like man , and equipage to attract respect , without one other qualification to enforce it ? here let I close this , with a few tear , to the memory of my dear , my other mother , my friend , my adviser , my protectress , in my single state ; and my faithful second and partaker in the comfort of my higher life , and better fortune ! what would I have give to have be present , as it seem , she so earnestly wish , to close she die eye ! I should have do it with the piety and the concern of a truly affectionate daughter . but that melancholy happiness be deny to we both ; for , as I tell you in the letter on the occasion , the dear good woman ( who be now in the possession of she bless reward , and rejoice in 's mercy ) be no more , when the news reach I , so far off as , of she last illness and wish . I can not forbear , every time I enter she parlour ( where I use to see , with so much delight , the good woman sit , always employ in some useful or pious work ) , shed a tear to she memory ; and in my duty , miss _her_, I miss half a dozen friend , methink ; and I sigh in remembrance of she ; and can only recover that cheerful frame , which the performance of those duty always give I , by reflec , that she be now reap the reward of that sincere piety , which use to edify and encourage we all . the servant we bring home , and those we leave behind , melt in tear at the name of . , too , lament the loss of she , in the most move strain . and all I can do now , in honour of she memory and she merit , be to be a friend to those she love most , as I have already begin to be , and none of they shall suffer in those concern that can be answer , now she be gone . for the loss of so excellent a friend and relation , be loss enough to all who know she , and claim kindred with she . poor worthy , too , ( 'ti almost a misery to have so soft , so susceptible a heart as I have , or to have such good servants and friend as one can not lose without such emotion as I feel for the loss of they ! ) he silver hair , which I have beheld with so much delight , and think I have a father in presence , when I see they adorn so honest and comely a face , be now laid low !-- forgive I , he be not a common servant ; neither be _any of ours so : but excel all that excel in he class !- I be tell , that these two worthy folk die within two day of one another : on which occasion I could not help say to myself , in the word of over and he son , the name - sake of we worthy butler --" they be lovely and pleasant in they life , and in they death they be not divide ._ " I might have continue on in the word of the lamenter ; for , surly , never do one fellow - servant love another in my maiden state , nor servant love a mistress in my exalted condition , better than love I ! I could see in he eye a glistening pleasure , whenever I pass by he : if at such time I speak to he , as I seldom fail to do , with a --" _God bless you too !_ " in answer to he repeat blessing , he have a kind of rejuvenescence ( may I say ? ) visibly run through he whole frame : and , now and then , if I lay my hand upon he fold one , as I pass he on a morning or evening , pray for I , with a -- " how do you , my worthy old acquaintance ?_ " he heart would spre to he lip in a kind of rapture , and he eye would run over . of my beloved friend ! how the loss of these two worthy of my family oppress I at time ! likewise shew a generous concern on the occasion : and when all the servants welcome we in a body , on we return --" my dear , " say he , " I miss you , and honest . " a start tear , and -- " they be happy , dear honest soul ! " and a sigh , be the tribute I pay to they memory , on they beloved master 's so kindly repeat they name . who know , have I be here -- but away , too painful reflection -- they live to a good old age , and fall like fruit fully ripe : they _dy the death of the righteous ; I must follow they in time , know how soon ; and , _Oh ! that my latter end may be like theirs !_ once more , forgive I , my dear friend , this small tribute to they memory : and believe , that I be not so ungrateful for 's mercy , as to let the loss of these dear good folk lessen with I the joy and delight I have still leave I , in the health and the love of the best of husband , and good man ; in the child
child , charme as ever mother could boast of -- charming , I mean , principally , in the dawning beauty of they minds , and in the pleasure they towardliness of nature give I ; include , as I always do , my dear , and have reason to do , from she dutiful love of I , and observation of all I say to she ; in the preservation to I of the best and worthiest of parent , hearty , though a as they be ; in the love and friendship of good and , and my excellent friend ; not forget even worthy . God preserve all these to I , as I be truly thankful for he mercy ! -- and then , notwithstand my affecting loss , as above , who will be so happy as I ? that you , my dear may long continue so , likewise in the love of a worthy husband , and the delight of a increase hopeful family , which will make you some amend for the heavy loss you also have sustain , in the two last year of a affectionate father , and a most worthy mother , and , in , of a good neighbour , pray _your ever affectionate friend and servant , * * * * * letter c my , you will excuse my long silence , when I shall tell you the occasion of it . in the first place , I be oblige to pay a dutiful visit to , where my good father be take ill of a fever , and my mother of a ague ; and think . madam , how this must affect I , at they time of life ! kindly accompany I , apprehend that he presence would be necessary , if the recovery of they both , in which I thankfully rejoice , have not happen ; especially as a circumstance I be , I think , always in , add more weight to he apprehension . I have hardly return from to , and look around , when I be oblige to set out to attend , who say she should _die , if she see I not , to comfort and recover , by my counsel and presence ( so she be pleased to express herself ) she sick lord who have just get out of a intermittent fever , which leave he without any spirit , and be occasion by fretting at the conduct of she _stupid nephew ( those also be she word ) . for you must have heard ( every body hear when a man of quality do a foolish thing ! ) , and it have be in all the newspaper , that , " on last the " ( they should have say ) , " , nephew to the , be marry to the , relict of of , , a lady of celebrate beauty and ample fortune . " now , you must know , that this celebrate lady be , ' tis true , of the ---- family , whence she title of _honourable ; but be indeed so _celebrate , that every flutter coxcomb in town can give some account of she , even before she be in keeping of the of ---- who have cast she on the town he have rob of she . in short , she be quite a common woman ; have no fortune at all , as one may say , only a small jointure incumber ; and be much in debt . she be a shrew into the bargain , and the poor wretch be a father already ; for he have already have a girl of three year old ( she husband have be dead seven ) bring he home , which he know nothing of , nor even inquire , whether he widow have a child ! -- and he be now pay the mother 's debt , and try to make the best of he bargain . this be the fruit of a journey , so long desire by he , and he flutter about there with he new title . he be draw in by a brother of he lady , and a friend of that brother 's , two town sharper , gamester , and bully . poor ! this be he case , and he character , it seem , in . shall I present you with a curiosity ? " tTis a copy of he letter to he uncle , who have , as you may well think , lose all patience with he , on occasion of this abominable folly . " my , " for iff you will not call I neffew , I have no reason to call you unkell ; surely you forgett who it be you hold up you kane to : I have as little reason to valy you displeassure , as you have I : for I be , be thank , a lord and a pere of the realme , as well as you ; and as to your nott ownee I , nor you brother b . not look upon I , I care not a fardinge : and , bad as you think I have do , I have marry ' a woman of family . take thatt among you !

I have as good a estate as you have , and be as much a lord as yourselfe .-- why the devill then , be I to be treat as I be ?-- why the plague -- but I will not sware neither . I desire not to see you , any more than you doe I , I can tell you thatt . and iff we ever meet under one roofe with my likeing , it must be at the of where I shall be upon a parr with you in every thing , that be my cumfurte . " as to , I desire not to see she ladyship ; for she be always plaguy nimbel with she finger ; but , lett my false stepp be what itt will , I have in other respecte , marry ' a lady who be as well descende as herseife , and no disparagement neither ; so have nott thatt to answer for to she pride ; and who have as good a spiritt too , if they be to come face to face , or I be mistake : nor will shee take affmnte from any one . so my lord , leave mee to make the best of my matter , as I will of youre . so no more , but that I be _youre servant , . " p.s. I mean no affrunt to . . she be the best of yee all --by g --. " I will not take up you time with further observation upon this poor creature 's bad conduct : he reflection must proceed from _feeling ; and will , that be the worst of it , come too late , come _when or _how it will . I will only say , I be sorry for it on he own account , but more for that of and , who take the matter very heavily , and wish he have marry the lowest bear creature in ( so she have be honest and virtuous ) , rather than do as he have do . but , I suppose , the poor gentleman be resolve to shin , at all adventur , . fault , and keep up to the pride of descent and family ; -- and so marry the only creature , as I hope ( since it can not be help ) , that be so great a disgrace to both : for I presume to flatter myself , for the sake of my sex , that , among the poor wretch who be sink so low as the town - woman be , there be very few of birth or education ; but such , principally , as have have they necessity or they ignorance take advantage of by base man ; since birth and education must need set the most unhappy of the sex above so sordid and so abandon a guilt , as the hourly wickedness of such a course of life subject they to . but let I pursue my purpose of excuse my long silence . I have hardly return from 's , and recover my family management , and resume my nursery duty , when my fourth dear boy , my ( for , I think be I go on to make out the number allot I ) , press so upon I , as not to be refuse , for one month or six week close attention . and then a journey to 's , and that noble pair accompany we to ; and daily and hourly pleasure crowd upon we , narrow and confin as we room there be ( though we go with as few attendants as possible ) , engross _more_ of my time . thus I hope you will forgive I , because , as soon as I return , I set about write this , as a excuse for myself , in the first place ; to promise you the subject you insist upon , in the next ; and to say , that I be incapable of forgetfulness or negligence to such a friend as Lady g . for I must always be you _faithful and affectionate humble servant , my , the remark , you cousin Fielding say , I have make on the subject of young gentleman 's travelling , and which you request I to communicate to you , be part of a little book upon education , which I write for . correction and amendment , on he put 's treatise on that subject into my hand , and require my observation upon it . I can not flatter myself they will answer you expectation ; for I be sensible they must be unworthy even of the opportunity I have have in the excursion , in which I have be indulge by the best of man . but you request be so many law to I ; and I will give you a short abstract of what I read , who have so greatly overrate it to you . the gentleman 's book contain many excellent rule on education ; but this of travel I will only refer you to at present . you will there see he objection against the age at which young gentleman be send abroad , from sixteen to twenty - one , the time in all they life , he say , at which young gentleman be the least suit to these improvement , and in which they have the least fence and guard against they passion . the age he propose be from seven to fourteen , because of the advantage they will then have to master foreign language , and to form they tongue to the true pronunciation ; as well as that they will be more easily direct by
by they tutor or governors . or else he propose that more sedate time of life , when the gentleman be able to travel without a tutor , and to make he own observation ; and when he be thoroughly acquaint with the law and fashions , the natural and moral advantage and defect of he own country ; by which mean , as wisely observe , the traveller will have something to exchange with those abroad , from whose conversation he hope to reap any knowledge . and he support he opinion by excellent reason , to which i refer you . what I have write in my little book , not yet quite finish on _this_ head , relate principally to , which be always resolve he son should undertake , before they enter upon a foreign tour . I have there observe , that abound with curiosity , both of art and nature , worth the notice of a diligent inquirer , and equal with some of those we admire in foreign part ; and that if the youth be not send abroad at 's earliest time , from seven to fourteen ( which I can hardly think will be worth while , merely for the sake of attaine a perfection in the language ) , he may with good advantage begin , at fourteen or fifteen , the tour of Great , now - and - then , by excursion , in the summer month , between he other study , and as a diversion to he . this I should wish might be enter upon in he papa 's company , as well as he tutor 's , if it could conveniently be do ; who thus initiate both the governed and governor in the methods he would have observe by both , will obtain no small satisfaction and amusement to himself . for the father would by this means be a eye - witness of the behaviour of the one and the other , and have a specimen how fit the young man be to be trust , or the tutor to be depend upon , when they go abroad , and be out of he sight : as _they would of what be expect from they by the father . and hence a thousand benefit may arise to the young gentleman from the occasional observation and reflection of he father , with regard to expence , company , conversation , hour , and such like . if the father could not himself accompany he son , he might appoint the stage the young gentleman should take , and enjoin both tutor and son to give , at every stage , a account of whatever they observe curiious and remarkable , not omitt the minutest occurrence . by this mean , and the probability that he might hear of they , and they proceedings , from he friend , acquaintance , and relation , who might fall in with they , they would have a greater regard to they conduct ; and so much the more , if the young gentleman be to keep a account of he expence , which , upon he return , he might lay before he father . by see thus the different custom , manners , and economy of different person and family ( for in so mix a nation as ours be , there be as great a variety of that sort to be meet with , as in most ) , and from they different treatment , at they several stage , a great deal of the world may be learn by the young gentleman . he would be prepared to go abroad with more delight to himself , as well as more experience , and greater reputation to he family and country . in such excursion as these , the tutor would see he temper and inclination , and might notice to the father any thing amiss , that it might be set right , while the youth be yet in he reach , and more under he inspection , than he would be in a foreign country ; and he observation , on he return , as well as in he letter , would show how fit he be to be trust ; and how likely to improve , when at a greater distance . after and , as well the inland part as the sea -coast , let they if they behave accord to expectation , take a journey into and , and visit the principal island , as , , &c. the youth continue to write down he observation all the way , and keep a journal of occurrence ; and let he employ the little time he will be on board of ship , in these small trip from island to island , or coastwise , in observe upon the noble art of navigation ; of the theory of which , it will not be amiss that he have some notion , as well as of the curiious structure of a ship , its tackle , and furniture : a knowledge very far from be insignificant to a gentleman who be a islander , and have a stake in the greatest maritime kingdom in the world ; and hence he will be teach to love and value that most useful and brave set of man , the british sailor , who be the natural defence and glory of the realm . hereby he will confirm he theory in the geography of the british dominion in , he will be apprise of the situation , convenience , interest , and constitution of he own country ; and will be able to lay a ground - work for the future government of he thought and action , if the interest he bear in he native country should call he to the public service in
in either house of parliament . with this foundation , how excellently would he be qualified to go abroad ! and how properly then would he add to the knowledge he have attaine of he own country , that of the different custom , manners , and form of government of other ! how would he be able to form comparison , and to make all he inquiry appear pertinent and manly . all the occasion of that ignorant wonder , which render a novice the jest of all about he , would be take away . he would be able to ask question , and to judge without lead string . would he think he have see a country , and answer the end of he father 's expence , and he own improvement , by run through a kingdom , and know nothing of it , but the inns and stage , at which he stop to eat and drink . for , on the contrary , he would make the best acquaintance , and contract worthy friendship with such as would court and reverence he as one of the rise geniuse of he country . whereas most of the young gentleman who be send abroad raw and unprepared , as if to wonder at every thing they see , and to be laugh at by all that see they , do but expose themselves and they country . and if , at they return , by interest of friend , by alliances , or marriage , they should happen to be promote to place of honour or profit , they unmerited preferment will only serve to make those foreigner , who be eye - witness of they weakness and folly , when among they , conclude greatly in disfavour of the whole nation , or , at least , of the prince , and he administration , who could find no fitter subject to distinguish . this , my dear friend , be a brief extract from my observation on the head of qualifying young gentleman to travel with honour and improvement . I doubt you will be apt to think I not a little out of my element ; but since you _would have it , I claim the allowances of a friend ; to which my ready compliance with you command the rather entitle I . I be very sorry and be so unhappy in each other . be he a generous man , the heavy loss the poor lady have sustain , as well as she sister , my beloved friend , in so excellent a mother , and so kind a father , would make he bear with she infirmity a little . but , really , I have see , on twenty occasion , that notwithstand all the fine thing gentleman say to lady before marriage , if the latter do not _improve upon they husband 's hand , they impute graces when single , will not protect they from indifference , and , probably , from worse ; while the gentleman , perhaps , think _he_ only , of the two , be entitled to go backward in act of kindness and complaisance . a strange and shocke difference which too many lady experience , who , from fond lover , prostrate at they foot , find surly husband , trampl upon they neck ! you , my dear friend , be happy in you day of courtship , and be no less so in you state of wedlock . and may you continue to be so to a good old age , _pray you affectionate and faithful friend ,_ P.B. my dear , I will cheerfully cause to be transcribe for you the conversation you desire , between myself , , and , and the three young lady they relation , in presence of the dean and he daughter , and ; and glad I shall be , if it may be of use to the two thoughtless you neighbour ; who , you be pleased to tell I , be great admirer of my story and my example ; and will therefore , as you say , pay greater attention to what I write , than to the more passionate and interested lesson of they mamma . I be only sorry you should be concerned about the suppose trouble you give I , by have mislaid my former relation of it . for , besides oblige my dear , the hope of do service by it to a family so worthy , in a case so nearly affect its honour , as to make two headstrong young lady recollect what belong to they sex and they character , and what they filial duty require of they , afford I high pleasure ; and if it shall be attend with the wished effect , it will add to my happiness . I say , _cause to be transcribe , because I hope to answer a double end by it ; for , on reconsideration , I set to transcribe it , who write a pretty hand , and be not a little fond of the task , nor , indeed , of any task I set she ; and will be more affected as she perform it , than she could be by _reading it only ; although she be a very good girl at present , and give I hope that she will continue to be so . I will inclose it when do , that it may be read to the party without this introduction , if you think fit . and you will forgive I for have add a few observation , with a view to the case of you inconsiderate young lady , and for have correcte the former narrative in several place . my dear , the papers you have mislaid , as to the conversation
conversation between I and the young lady , relation of , and , in presence of these two last - named lady , Brooks , and the worthy dean , and . ( of which , in order to perfect you kind collection of my communication you request another copy ) contain as follow . I first state , that I have see these three lady twice or thrice before , as visitor , at they kinswoman 's house so that they and I be not altogether stranger to one another : and my two neighbour acquaint I with they respective taste and disposition , and they histories preparatory to this visit , to the follow effect : that be over -run with the love of poetry and romance , and delights in flowery language and metaphorical flourish : be about eighteen , want 's not either sense or politeness ; and have read herself into a vein , more amorous ( that be 's word ) than discreet . have extraordinary notions of a _first sight love ; and give herself greater liberty , with a pair of fine eye ( in hope to make sudden conquest in pursuance of that notion ) , than be pretty in she sex and age ; which make those who know she not , conclude she bold and forward ; and be more than suspect , with a mind thus prepare for instantaneous impressions , to have experience the argument to she own disadvantage , and to be _struck_ by ( before she have _stricken ) a gentleman , whom she friend think not at all worthy of she , and to whom she be make some indiscreet advance , under the name of to , in a letter which she entrust to a servant of the family , who , discover she design , prevent she indiscretion for that time . that , in other respects , she have no mean accomplishment , will have a fine fortune , be genteel in she person , though with some visible affectation , dance well , sings well , and play prettily on several instrument ; be fond of reading , but affect the action , and air , and attitude of a tragedian ; and be too apt to give a emphasis in the wrong place , in order to make a author mean significantly , even where the occasion be common , and , in a mere historical fact , that require as much simplicity in the reader 's accent , as in the writer 's style . no wonder then , that when she read a play , she will put herself into a sweat , as say ; distort very agreeable feature , and make a _multitude of wry mouth with _one_ very pretty one , in order to convince she hearer , what a near neighbour she heart be to she lip . be a young lady of nineteen , lovly in she person , with a handsome fortune in possession , and great prospect . have a soft and gentle turn of mind , which dispose she to be easily impos upon . be address by a libertine of quality , whose courtship , while permit , be imperiousness ; and whose tenderness , insult : have find the young lady too susceptible of impression , open and unreserved , and even value he the more , as it see , for treat she with ungenerous contempt ; for that she be always make excuse for slights , ill manners , and even rudeness , which no other young lady would forgive . that this docility on she side , and this insolence on he , and a over -free , and even indecent degree of romping , as it be call , with she , which once she mamma surprise they in , make she papa forbid _his visit , and _her_ receive they . that this however , be so much to 's regret , that she be detect in a design to elope to he out of the private garden - door ; which , have she effect , in all probability , the indelicate and dishonourable peer would have triumph over she innocence ; have give out since , that he intend to revenge himself on the daughter , for the disgrace he have receive from the parent . that though convince of this , it be fear she still love he , and would again throw herself in he way ; urging , that he rash expression be the effect only of he passion ; for that she know he love she too well to be dishonourable to she ; and by the same degree of favourable prepossession , she will have it , that he brutal roughness be the manliness of he nature ; that he most shocking expression be sincerity of heart ; that he boast of former lewdness be but instance that he know the world ; that he freedom with she person be but excess of love and innocent gaiety of temper ; that he resent the prohibition he have meet with , and he threat , be other instance of he love and he courage : and peer of the realm ought not to be bound down by little narrow rule like the vulgar ; for , truly , they _honour_ be in the greatest case regard as equal with the _oath of a common gentleman , and be a security that a lady may trust to , if he be not a profligate indeed ; and that _cannot be . that except these weakness , have many good quality ; be charitable , pious , humane , humble ; sings sweetly , play on the spinnet charmingly ; be meek , fearful , and never be resolute or courageous enough to step out of the regular path
path , till she too flexible heart become touch with a passion , that be say to polish the most brutal temper , and therefore she rough peer have none of it ; and to animate the dove , of which have too much . that , a young lady of the like age with the two former , have too lively and airy a turn of mind ; affect to be think well read in the histories of kingdom , as well as in polite literature . speak French fluently , talk much upon all subject ; and have a great deal of flippant wit , which make more enemie than friend . however , be innocent , and unsuspectedly virtuous hitherto ; but make herself cheap and accessible to fop and rake , and have not the worse opinion of a man for be such . Listens eagerly to story tell to the disadvantage of some of she own sex ; though affect to be a great stickler for the honour of it in general : will unpityingly propagate they : think ( without consider to what the imprudence of she own conduct may subject she ) the woman that slip inexcusable ; and the man who seduce she , much less faulty ; and thus encourage the one sex in they vileness , and give up the other for they weakness , in a kind of silly affectation , to show she security in she own virtue ; at the same time , that she be dance upon the edge of a precipice , presumptuously inattentive to she own danger . the worthy dean , know the lady 's intention in this visit to I , bring he daughter with he , as if by accident ; for with many good quality , be of a remarkable soft temper , though not so inconsiderately soft as : but be too credulous ; and , as she papa suspect , entertaind more than a liking to a wild young gentleman , the heir to a noble fortune , who make visit to she , full of tenderness and respect , but without declare himself . this give the dean much uneasiness ; and he be very desirous that he daughter should be in my company on all occasion , as she be so kind to profess a great regard to my opinion and judgment . ' tTis easy to see the poor young lady be in love ; and she make no doubt that the young gentleman love _her ; but , alas ! why then ( for he be not a bashful man , as you shall hear ) do he not say so ?-- he have deceive already two young creature . he father have caution the dean against he son . have tell he , that he be sly , subtle , full of stratagem , yet have so much command of himself ( which make he more dangerous ) , as not to precipitate he design ; but can wait with patience till he think himself secure of he prey , and then pull off the mask at once ; and , if he succeed , glory in he villainy . yet do he father beg of the dean to permit he visit , for he wish he to marry though greatly unequal in fortune to he son , wish for nothing so much as that he _would marry . and the dean , owe he principal preferment to the old gentleman , care not to disoblige he , or affront he son , without some apparent reason for it , especially as the father be wrapt up in he , have no other child , and be himself half afraid of he , least , if too much thwart , he should fly out entirely . so here , , be four young lady of like year , and different inclination and temper , all of whom may be say to have dangers to encounter , result from they respective disposition : and who , professe to admire my character and example , be bring to I , to be benefit , as Tower be pleased to say , by my conversation : and all be to be as if accidental , none of they know how well I be acquaint with they several character . how proud would this compliment have make I from such a lady as Tower , have I not be as proud as proud could be before , of the good opinion of four beloved person , , lady Davers , the Countess of and you dear self . we be attend only by , who in some point be as much concerned as any body . and this be when and , and the noble Countess , be with we , ' tis proper to say , they be abroad together upon a visit , from which , know how I be to be engage , they excuse I . the dean be well know to , and value by , all the lady ; and therefore be no manner of restraint upon the freedom of we conversation . I be in my closet when they come ; and . , have present each young lady to I when I come down , say , be all seate , " I can guess at you employment , . . writing , I dare say ? I have often wish to have you for a correspondent ; for every one who can boast of that favour , exalt you to the sky , and say , you letter exceed you conversation , but I always insist upon it that _that be impossible . " " Mr . Tower , " say I , " be always say the most obliging thing in the world of she neighbour : but
but may not one suffer , dear madam , for these kind prepossession , in the opinion of greater stranger , who will judge more impartially than you favour will permit you to do ? " " that , " say , " will be so soon put out of doubt , when . begin to speak , that we will refer to that , and to put a end to every thing that look like compliment . " " but , , " say , " may one ask , what particular subject be at this time you employment ? " I have be write ( you must know , ) for the sake of suiting 's flighty vein , a little sketch of the style she be so fond of ; and hope for some such opportunity as this question give I , to bring it on the carpet ; for my only fear , with she and , and , be , that they would deem I too grave ; and so what should fall in the course of conversation , would make the least impression upon they . for the best instruction , you know , will be ineffectual , if the manner of convey they be not adapt to the taste and temper of the person you would wish to influence . and moreover , I have a view in it , to make this little sketch the introduction to some future observation on the stiff and affect style of romance , which might put out of conceit with they , and make she turn the course of she study another way , as I shall mention in it be place . I answer that I have be meditat upon the misfortunes of a fine young lady , who have be seduce and betray by a gentleman she love , and who , notwithstand , have the grace to stop short ( indeed , later than be to be wish ) , and to abandon friend , country , lover , in order to avoid any further intercourse with he ; and that have bless she penitence and resolution , and she be now very happy in a neighbour dominion . " a fine subject , " say . " be the gentleman a man of wit , ? be the lady a woman of taste ? " we condemn every man who dress well , and be not a sloven , as a fop or a coxcomb ? " " no doubt , when this be the case . but you hardly ever see a man _very nice about he person and dress , that have any thing he think of _greater_ consequence to himself to regard . ' tTis natural it should be so ; for should not the man of _body take the greater care to set out and adorn the part for which he think himself most valuable ? and will not the man of _mind bestow he principal care in improve that mind ? perhaps to the neglect of dress , and outward appearance , which be a fault . but surely , Madam , there be a middle way to be observe , in these , as in most other case ; for a man need not be a sloven , any more than a fop . he need not show a utter disregard to dress , nor yet think it he first and chief concern ; be ready to quarrel with the wind for discompose he peruke , or fear to put on he hat , lest he should depress he foretop ; more dislike a spot upon he clothes , than in he reputation ; be a self - admirer , and always at the glass , which he would perhaps never look into , could it show he the deformity of he mind , as well as the finery of he person ; who have a taylor for he tutor , and a milliner for he school -mistress ; who laugh at man of sense ( excusably enough , perhaps in revenge because they laugh at he ) ; who call learn pedantry , and look upon the knowledge of the fashions as the only useful science to a fine gentleman . " pardon I , lady ; I could proceed with the character of this species of man , but I need not ; for every lady present would despise such a one , as much as I do , be he to fall in she way : or the rather , because he who admire himself , will never admire he lady as he ought ; and if he maintain he niceness after marriage , it will be with a preference to he own person ; if not , will sink , very probably , into the worst of sloven . for whoever be capable of one extreme ( take almost the case of human life through ) when he recede from that , if he be not a man of prudence , will go over into the other . " but to return to the former subject " ( for the general attention encourage I to proceed ) , " permit I , , to add , that a lady must run great risk to she reputation , if not to she virtue , who will admit into she company any gentleman who shall be of opinion , and know it to be _her , that it be _his_ province to ask a favour , which it will be _her_ duty to deny . " " I believe , Madam , I speak these word a little too carelessly ; but I mean _honourable question , to be sure . " " there can be but _one_ honourable question , " reply I ; " and that be seldom ask , but when the
the affair be bring near a conclusion , and there be a probability of its be grant ; and which a single lady , while she have parent or guardian , should never think of permit to be put to herself , much less of approve , nor , perhaps , as the case may be of denying . but I make no doubt that you mean honourable question . a young lady of 's good sense , and worthy character , could not mean otherwise . and I have say , perhaps , more than I need upon the subject , because we all know how ready the presuming of the other sex be , right or wrong to construe the most innocent meeting in favour of they own view . " " very true , " say she ; but appear to be under a agreeable confusion , every lady , by she eye , seem to think she have meet with a deserve rebuke ; and which not seem to expect , it abate she liveliness all the time after . seasonably relieve we both from a subject too applicable , if I may so express it , say -- " but , dear , will you favour we with the result of you meditation , if commit to write , on the unhappy case you mention ? " " I be rather . madam , exercise my fancy than my judgment , such as it be , upon the occasion . I be aim at a kind of allegorical or metaphorical style , I know not which to call it ; and it be not fit to be read before such judge , I doubt . " " of pray , dear madam , " say , " favour we with it _too choose ; for I be a great admirer of that style . " " I have a great curiosity , " say , " both from the _subject_ and the _style , to hear what you have write : and I beg you will oblige we all . " " it be short and unfinished . it be write for the sake of a friend , who be fond of such a style ; and what I shall add to it , will be principally some slight observation upon this way of writing . but , let it be ever so censurable , I should be more so , if I make any difficulty after such a unanimous request . " so , take it out of my letter - case , I read as follow : " while the _bank of _discretion_ keep the _proud water of _passion_ within they natural channel , all calm and serene glide along the silver current , enliven the adjacent meadow , as it pass , with a brighter and more flowery verdure . but if the _torrent of _sensual love be permit to descmend from the _hill of _credulous hope_ , they may so swell the genle stream , as to make it difficult , if not impossible , to be retain betwixt its usual bounds . what then will be the consequence ?-- why , the _tree of resolution , and the _shrub of cautious fear , which grow upon the frail mound , and whose intertwin root have contribute to support it , be loose from they hold , _they , and all that would swim of the _bank_ itself , will be see float on the surface of the triumphant water . " but here , a dear lady , have unhappily fail , be enable to set she _foot in the _new-made_ breach , while yet it be _possible to stop it , and to say , with little variation in the language of that power , which only could enable _her_ to say it . _Hither , ye proud wave of dissolute love , although you_ have _come , yet no farther_ shall _ye come ;_ be such a instance of magnanimous resolution and self - conquest , as be very rarely to be meet with . " seem pleased ( as I expect ) , and tell I , that she should take it for a high favour , to be permit , if not improper , to see the whole letter when finish . I say , I would oblige she with all my heart .-" but you must not expect , Madam , that although I have write what I have read to you , I shall approve of it in my observation upon it ; for I be convinced , that no style can be proper , which be not plain , simple , easy , natural and unaffected . " she be sure , she be pleased to say , that whatever my observation be , they would be equally just and instructive . " I too , " say the dean , " will answer for that ; for I dare say , by what I have already hear , that Mr . b . will distinguish properly between the style ( and the matter too ) which captivate the imagination , and that which inform the judgment . " we conversation , after this , take a more general turn ; which I think right , lest the young lady should imagine it be a design thing against they : yet it be such , that every one of they find she character and taste , little or much , concerned in it ; and all seem , as Tower afterwards observ to I , by they silence and attention , to be busy in private applications . the dean begin it with a high compliment to I ; have a view , no doubt , by he kind praise , to make my observation have the greater weight upon the young lady .
. he say , it be matter of great surprise to he , that , my tender year consider , I should be capable of make those reflection , by which persons of twice my age and experience might be instruct .-" you see , , " say he , " we attention , when you lip begin to open ; and I beg we may have nothing to do , but to _be_ attentive . " " I have have such advantage , , from the observation and caution of my late excellent lady , that do you but know half of they , you would rather wonder I have make _no greater improvement , than that I have make _so much ._ she use to think I pretty , and not ill - tempere , and , of _course not incredulous , where I conceive a good opinion ; and be always arm I on that side , as believe I might be the object of wicked attempt , and the rather , as my low fortune subject I to danger . for , have I be bear to rank and condition , as these young lady here , I should have have reason to think of _myself , as justly as , no doubt , _they do , and , of consequence , beyond the reach of any vile intriguer ; as I should have be above the greatest part of that species of mankind , who , for want of understanding or honour , or through pernicious habit , give themselves up to libertinism . " " these be great advantage , " say ; " but in _you , they meet with a surprising genius , 'tis very plain , Madam ; and there be not , in my opinion , a lady of , of you year , who would have improve by they as you have do . " I answer , that I be much oblige by she good opinion : and that I have always observed , the person who admire any good quality in another , give a kind of _natural_ demonstration , that she have the same in a eminent degree herself , although , perhaps , she modest diffidence would not permit she to trace the generous principle to its source . the dean , to renew the subject of _credulity , repeat my remark , that it be safer , in case where so much depend upon the issue , as a lady 's honour and reputation , to _fear_ a _enemy , than to _hope a _friend ; and praise my observation , that even a _weak_ enemy be not to be too much despise . I say , I have very high notion of the honour and value of my own sex , and very mean one of the gay and frothy part of the other ; insomuch , that I think they could have no strength , but what be found in we weakness : that the difference of education must give man advantage , even where the genius be naturally equal ; besides , they have generally more hardness of heart , which make woman , where they meet not with man of honour , engage with that sex upon very unequal term ; for that it be so customary with they to make vow and promise , and to set light by they , _when make , that a innocent lady can not guard too watchfully against they ; and , in my opinion , should believe nothing they say , or even _vow , but what carry demonstration with it . " I remember my lady use often to observe , there be a time of life in all young person , which may properly be call _to romantic , which be a very dangerous period , and require therefore a great guard of prudence ; that the risque be not a little augment by read novel and romance ; and the poetical tribe have much to answer for , by reason of they heighten and inflam description , which do much hurt to thoughtless mind , and lively imagination . for to those , she would have it , be principally owing , the rashness and indiscretion of _soft_ and _tender_ disposition : which , in breach of they duty , and even to the disgrace of they sex , too frequently set they upon enterprisis , like those they have read in those pernicious writing , which not seldom make they fall a sacrifice to the base design of some wild intriguer ; and even in casis where they precipitation end the best , that be to say , in _marriage , they too frequently ( in direct opposition to the caution and command of they _try , they _experience , and _unquestionable friend ) throw themselves upon a _almost stranger , who , have he be worthy of they , would not , nor _need to have take indirect method to obtain they favour . " and the misfortune be , the most innocent be generally the most credulous . such a lady would do no harm to other , and can not think other would do she any . and as to the particular person who have obtain , perhaps , a share in she confidence , _he cannot , she think , be so _ungrateful , as to return irreparable mischief for she good - will to he . be all the man in the world beside to prove false , the _beloved person cannot . 'Twould be unjust to _her own merit , as well as to t_his view , to suppose it : and so _design on he side , and _credulity and _self - opinion , on the lady 's , at last enrol the unhappy believer in the list of the too -
- late repenter . " " and what , , " say the dean , " have not that wretch to answer for , who make sport of destroy a virtuous character , and in be the wicked means of throw , perhaps , upon the town , and into the dregs of prostitution , a poor creature , whose love for he , and confidence in he , be all she crime ? and who otherwise might have make a worthy figure at the head of a reputable family , and so have be a useful member of the commonwealth , propagat good example , instead of ruin and infamy , to mankind ? to say nothing of , what be still worse , the dreadful crime of occasion the loss of a soul ; since final impenitence too generally follow the first sacrifice which the poor wretch be seduce to make of she honour ! " " there be several gentleman in we neighbourhood , " say . , " who might be benefite by this touching reflection , if represent in the same strong light from the pulpit . and I think , , you should give we a sermon upon this subject , for the sake of both sex , one for caution , the other for conviction . " " I will think of it , " reply he , " but I be sorry to say , that we have too many among we younger gentry who would think themselves point at be I to touch this subject ever so cautiously . " " I be sure , " say , " there can not well be a more useful one ; and the very reason the dean give , be a convince proof of it to I . " " when I have have the pleasure of hear the further sentiment of such a assembly as this , upon the delicate subject , " reply this polite divine , " I shall be better enable to treat it . and pray , lady , proceed ; for it be from you conversation that I must take my hint . " " you have only , then , " say , " to engage to speak , and you may be sure , we will all be as attentive to _her , as we shall be to _you_, when we have the pleasure to hear so fine a genius improve upon she hint , from the pulpit . " I bow to ; and know she praise I , with the dean 's view , in order to induce the young lady to give the greater attention to what she wish I to speak , I say , it would be a great presumption in I , after so high a compliment , to open my lip : nevertheless , as I be sure , by speak , I should have the benefit of instruction , whenever it make _them speak , I would not be backward to enter upon any subject ; for that I should consider myself as a young counsel , in some great cause , who serve but to open it and prepare the way for those of greater skill and ability . " I beg , then , , " say , " you will _open the cause , be the subject what it will . and I could almost wish , that we have as many gentleman here as lady , who would have reason to be asham of the libertie they take in censur the conversation of the tea - table ; since the pulpit , as the worthy dean give we reason to hope , may be beholden to that of . " " be it much wonder , " reply I , " when the dean himself be with we , and it be grac by so distinguished a circle . " " if many of we young gentleman , be here , " say , " they might improve themselves in all the graces of polite and sincere complaisance . but , compare to this , I have generally hear such trite and coarse stuff from we race of would - be wit , that what they say may be compare to the fawning and salutation of the ass in the fable , who , emulat the lap - dog , merit a cudgel rather than encouragement . " but , , " continue she , " begin , I pray you , to _open_ and _proceed in the cause ; for there will be no counsel employ but you , I can tell you . " " then give I a subject that will suit I , lady , and you shall see how my obedience to you command will make I run on . " " will you , , " say , " give we a few caution and instruction on a theme of you own , that a young lady should rather _fear_ too much than _hope_ too much ? a necessary doctrine , perhaps ; but a difficult one to be practise by one who have begin to love , and who suppose all truth and honour in the object of she favour . " " _Hope , , " say I , " in my opinion , should never be unaccompany by _fear ; and the more reason will a lady ever have to fear , and to suspect herself , and doubt she lover , when she once begin to find in she own breast a inclination to he . for then she danger be double , since she have _herself ( perhaps the more dangerous enemy of the two ) to guard against , as well as _him ._ " she may secretly wish the best indeed : but what _have be the fate of other _may
_may be_ she own ; and though she think it not _probable , from such a faithful protester , as he appear to she to be , yet , while it be _possible , she should never be off she guard : nor will a prudent woman trust to he mercy or honour ; but to she own discretion : and the rather , because , if he mean well , he _himself will value she the more for she caution , since every man desire to have a virtuous and prudent wife ; if not well , she will detect he the sooner , and so , by she prudence , frustrate all he base design . " but let I , my dear lady , ask , what that passion be , which generally we dignify by the name of love ; and which , when so dignify , put we upon a thousand extravagance ? I believe , if examine into , it would be find too generally to owe its original to _ungovern fancy ;_ and be we to judge of it by the consequence that usually attend it , it ought rather to be call _rashness , inconsideration , weakness , and thing but _love ; for very seldom , I doubt , be the solid judgment so much concerned in it , as the _airy fancy ._ but when once we dignify the wild mis-leader with the name of _love , all the absurdity which we read in novel and romance take place , and we be induce to follow example that seldom end happily but in _them ._ " but , permit I further to observe , that love , as we call it , operate differently in the two sex , as to its effect . for in woman it be a _creeping_ thing , in a man a _incroacher ;_ and this ought , in my humble opinion , to be very seriously attend to . intimate thus much , when she observe that it be the man 's province to ask , the lady 's to deny :-- excuse I . Madam , the observation be just , as to the man 's notions ; although , methink , I would not have a lady allow of it , except in case of caution to themselves . " the doubt , therefore , which a lady have of she _lover 's honour , be needful to preserve _her own and _he too . and if she do he wrong , and he should be too just to deceive she , she can make he amend , by instance of greater confidence , when she please . but if she have be accustom to grant he little favour , can she easily recal they ? and will not the _incroacher_ grow upon she indulgence , pleading for a favour to - day , which be not refuse he yesterday , and reproach she want of confidence , as a want of esteem ; till the poor lady , who , perhaps , have give way to the _creeping , insinuat passion , and have avow she esteem for he , put herself too much in he power , in order to manifest , as she think , the _generosity of she affection ; and so , by degree , be carry farther than she intend , or nice honou ought to have permit ; and all , because , to keep up to my theme , she _hope too much , and _doubt too little ? and there have be case , where a man himself , pursue the dictate of he _incroaching passion , and find a lady _too conced , have take advantage , of which , probably , at first he do not presume to think . " say , that _virtue itself speak when _I_ spoke ; and she be resolve to recollect as much of this conversation as she could , and write it down in she common - place book , where it would make a better figure than any thing she have there . " I suppose , , " say , " you chief collection be flower of rhetoric , pick up from the french and English poet , and novel - writer . I would give something for the pleasure of have it two hour in my possession . " " , , " reply she , a little abashed , " how can you expose you kinswoman thus , before the dean and b.? " " Mr . Tower , " say I , " only say this to provoke you to show you collection . I wish I have the pleasure of see they . I doubt not but you common - place book be a store - house of wisdom . " " there be nothing bad in it , I hope , " reply she ; " but I would not , that . should see it for the world . but , " ( to ) , " there be many beautiful thing , and good instruction , to be collect from novel and play , and romance ; and from the poetical writer particularly , light as you be pleased to make of they . , " ( to I ) , " have you ever be at all conversant in such writer ? " " not a great deal in the former : there be very few novel and romance that my lady would permit I to read ; and those I do , give I no great pleasure ; for either they deal so much in the _marvellous and _improbable , or be so unnaturally _inflam to the _passion , and so full of _love_ and _intrigue , that most of they see calculate to _fire_ the _imagination , rather than to _inform_ the _judgment
_judgment ._ titles and tournament , breaking of spear in honour of a mistress , engage with monster , rambl in search of adventure , make unnatural difficulty , in order to show the knight - errant 's prowess in overcome they , be all that be require to constitute the _hero_ in such piece . and what principally distinguish the character of the _heroine be , when she be teach to consider she father 's house as a enchant castle , and she lover as the hero who be to dissolve the charm , and to set at liberty from one confinement , in order to put she into another , and , too probably , a worse : to instruct she how to climb wall , leap precipice , and do twenty other extravagant thing , in order to show the mad strength of a passion she ought to be asham of ; to make parent and guardian pass for tyrant , the voice of reason to be drown in that of indiscreet love , which exalt the other sex , and debase she own . and what be the instruction that can be gather from such piece , for the conduct of common life ? " then have I be ready to quarrel with these writer for another reason ; and that be , the dangerous notion which they hardly ever fail to propagate , of a _first - sight love . for there be such a susceptibility suppos on both side ( which , however it may pass in a man , very little become the female delicacy ) that they be smite with a glance : the fictitious blind god be make a _real_ divinity : and too often prudence and discretion be the first offering at he shrine . " " I believe , , " say , blush , and play with she fan , " there have be many instance of people 's love at first sight , which have end very happily . " " no doubt of it , " reply I . " but there be three chance to one , that so precipitate a liking do not . for where can be the room for caution , enquiry , the display of merit and sincerity , and even the assurance of a _grateful return , to a lady , who thus suffer herself to be prepossess ? be it not a random shot ? be it not a proof of weakness ? be it not give up the negative voice , which belong to the sex , even while she be not sure of meeting with the affirmative one from he whose affection she wish to engage ? " indeed , lady , " continue I , " I can not help concluding ( and I be the less afraid of speak my mind , because of the opinion I have of the prudence of every lady that hear I ) , that where this weakness be find , it be no way favourable to a lady 's character , nor to that discretion which ought to distinguish it . it look to I , as if a lady 's _heart be too much in the power of she _eye , and that she have permit she _fancy to be much more busy than she _judgment_. " blush , and look around she . " but I observe , " say , " whenever you censure any indiscretion , you seldom fail to give caution how to avoid it ; and pray let we know what be to be do in this case ? that be to say , how a young lady ought to guard against and overcome the first favourable impressions ? " " what I imagine , " reply I , " a young lady ought to do , on any the least favourable impressions of the kind , be immediately to _withdraw into herself , as one may say ; to reflect upon what she owe to she parent , to she family , to she character , and to she sex ; and to resolve to check such a random prepossession , which may much more probably , as I hint , make she a prey to the undeserving than otherwise , as there be so many of that character to one man of real merit . " the most that I apprehend a _first - sight approbation can do , be to inspire a _liking ; and a liking be conquerable , if the person will not brand over it , till she hatch it into _love . then every man and woman have a black and a white side ; and it be easy to set the imperfection of the person against the suppose perfection , while it be only a _liking . but if the busy fancy be permit to work as it pleasis , uncontrolled , then ' tis very likely , be the lady but to keep herself in countenance for receive first impressions , she will see perfection in the object , which no other living soul can . and it may be expect , that as a consequence of she first indiscretion , she will confirm , as a act of she judgment , what she wild and ungoverned fancy have misl she to think of with so much partial favour . and too late , as it probably may happen , she will see and lament she fatal , and , perhaps , undutiful error . " we be talk of the ladie only , " add I ( for I see be become very grave ) : " but I believe first - sight love often operate too powerfully in both sex : and where it do so , it will be very lucky , if either gentleman or lady find reason , on cool
cool reflection , to approve a choice which they be so ready to make without think . " " ' allow , " say , " that rash and precipitate love _may operate pretty much alike in the rash and precipitate of both sex : and which soever love , generally exalt the person belove above he or she merit : but I be desirous , for the sake of we maiden lady , since it be a science in which you be so great a adept , to have you advice , how we should watch and guard it be first incroachment and that you will tell we what you apprehend give the man most advantage over we . " " Nay , now , Tower , you rally my presumption , indeed ! " " I admire you , Madam , " reply she , " and every thing you say and do ; and I will not forgive you to call what I so seriously _say and _think , raillery . for my own part , " continue she , " I never be in love yet , nor , I believe , be any of these young lady . " ( look a little silly upon this . ) " and who can better instruct we to guard _our heart , than a lady who have so well defend _her own _? " " why then , , if I must speak , I think , what give the other sex the greatest advantage over even many of the most deserve one , be that dangerous foible , the _love of praise , and the desire to be _flatter and _admire _, a passion I have observe to predominate , more or less , from sixteen to sixty , in most of we sex . we be too generally delighted with the company of those who extol we graces of person or mind : for , will not a _grateful_ lady study hard to return a_ few compliment to a gentleman who make she so _many ! she be concerned to _prove_ he a man of distinguished sense , or a polite man , at least , in regard to what she _think of herself ; and so the flatterer shall be prefer to such of the sincere and worthy , as can not say what they do not think . and by this mean many a excellent lady have fall a prey to some sordid designer . " then , I think , nothing can give gentleman so much advantage over we sex , as to see how readily a virtuous lady can forgive the capital fault of the most abandon of the other ; and that sad , sad notion , _that a reform rake make the best husband ; a notion that have do more hurt , and discredit too , to we sex ( as it have give more encouragement to the profligate , and more discouragement to the sober gentleman ) , than can be easily imagined . a fine thing , indeed I as if the wretch , who have run through a course of iniquity , to the endangering of soul and body , be to be deem the best companion for life , to a innocent and virtuous young lady , who be to owe the kindness of he treatment to she , to he have never before accompany with a modest woman ; nor , till he interest on one hand ( to which he extravagance , perhaps , compel he to attend ) , and he impaired constitution on the other , oblige he to it , so much as _wish to accompany with one ; and who always make a jest of the marriage state , and perhaps , of every thing either serious or sacred ! " " you observe , very well , " say : " but people will be apt to think , that you have less reason than any of we sex , to be severe against such a notion : for who be a greater rake than a certain gentleman , and who be a better husband ? " " madam , " reply I , " the gentleman you mean , never be a common town rake : he be a man of sense , and fine understanding : and he reformation , _secondarily , as I may say , have be the natural effect of those extraordinary quality . but also , I will presume to say , that that gentleman , as he have not many equals in the nobleness of he nature , so he be not likely , I doubt , to have many follower , in a reformation begin in the bloom of youth , upon _self - conviction , and altogether , humanly speak , _spontaneous . those lady who would plead he example , in support of this pernicious notion , should find out the same generous quality in the man , before they trust to it : and it will then do less harm ; though even then , I could not wish it to be generally entertaine . " " it be really unaccountable , " say , " after all , as , I remember , say on another occasion , that we sex should not as much insist upon virtue and sobriety , in the character of a man , as a man , be he ever such a rake , do in that of a lady . and ' tis certainly a great encouragement to libertinism , that a worn - out debauchee should think himself at any time good enough for a husband , and have the confidence to imagine , that a modest woman will accept of he address , with a_ preference_ of he to any other . " " I can account for
for it but one way , " say the dean : " and that be , that a modest woman be apt to be _diffident of she own merit and understanding and she think this diffidence a imperfection . a rake _never_ be troublead with it : so he have in perfection a quality she think she want ; and , know _too little _on the world , imagine she mend the matter by accepting of one who know too much_. " " that be well observ , , " say : " but there be another fault in we sex , which Mr . . have not touch upon ; and that be , the foolish vanity some woman have , in the hope of reform a wild fellow ; and that they shall be able to do more than any of they sex before they could do : a vanity that often cost they dear , as I know in more than one instance . " " another weakness , " say I , " might be produce against some of we sex , who join too readily to droll upon , and sneer at , the misfortune of any poor young creature , who have shew too little regard for she honour : and who ( instead of speaking of it with concern , and inveigh against the seducer ) too lightly sport with the unhappy person 's fall ; industriously spread the knowledge of it -- " [ I would not look upon , while I speak this ] , " and avoid she , as one infect ; and yet scruple not to admit into they company the vile aggressor ; and even to smile with he , at he barbarous jest , upon the poor sufferer of they own sex . " " I have know three or four instance of this in my time , " say , that might not take it to herself ; for she look down and be a little serious . " this , " reply I , " put I in mind of a little humourous copy of verse , write , as I believe by . and which , to the very purpose we be speak of , he call _" ' Benefit of make other ' misfortune we own ._ " ' Thou 'st hear it , or read it , a million of time , that man be make up of falsehood and crime ; search all the old author , and ransack the new , Thou 'lt find in love story , scarce one mortal true . then why this complain ? and why this wry face ? be it ' cause thou 'rt affect _most_ with thy own case ? have 'st thou sooner make _other '_ misfortune thy own , Thou never _thyself , this disaster hadst know ; thy _compassionate caution_ have keep thee from evil , and thou might 'st have defy ' mankind and the devil . ' " the lady be pleased with the line ; but want to know at what time of . life they could be write . " because , " add she , " I never suspect , before , that the good gentleman ever take pain to write caution or exhortation to we sex , to avoid the delusion of he own . " these verse , and these facetious , but severe , remark of . Tower , make every young lady look up with a cheerful countenance ; because it push the ball from _self : and the dean say to he daughter , " so , my dear , you , that have be so attentive , must let we know what useful inference you can draw from what . . and the other lady so excellently say . " " I observe . , from the fault the lady have so justly impute to some of we sex , that the advantage the gentleman _chiefly have over we , be from we own weakness : and that it behove a prudent woman to guard against _first impressions of favour , since she will think herself oblige , in compliment to _her own judgment , to find reason , if possible , to confirm they . " but I wish to know if there be any way that a woman can judge , whether a man mean honourably or not , in he address to she ! " " . can best inform you of that , , " say : " what say you , b.? " " there be a few sign , " answer I , " easy to be know , and , I think , almost infallible . " " pray let 's have they , " say ; and they all be very attentive . " I lay it down as a undoubted truth , " say I , " that true love be one of the most _respectful_ thing in the world . it strike with awe and reverence the mind of the man who boast it be impression . it be chaste and pure in word and deed , and can not bear to have the least indecency mingl with it . " if , therefore , a man , be he birth or quality what it will , the higher the worse , presume to wound a lady 's ear with indecent word : if he endeaavor , in he expression or sentiment , to convey gross or impure idea to she mind : if he be continually press for _her confidence_ in _his_ honour : if he request favour which a lady ought to refuse : if he can be regardless of he conduct or behaviour to she : if he can use _boisterous or _rude freedom , either to she _person_ or _dress _--" [ here poor ,
, by she blush , bear witness to she case . ] " if he avoid _speak of _marriage_ , when he have a _fair opportunity of do it -- " [ here look down and blush ] -- " or leave it _once to a lady to wonder that he do not :-- " in any , or in all these case , he be to be suspect , and a lady can have little hope of such a person ; nor , as I humbly apprehend , consistent with honour and discretion , encourage he address . " the lady be so kind as to applaud all I say , and so do the dean . , , and be to write down what they could remember of the conversation : and we noble guest come in soon after , with , the lady would have depart ; but he prevail upon they to pass the evening ; and , who have a admirable finger on the harpsichord , as I have before say , oblige we with two or three lesson . each of the lady do the like , and prevail upon I to play a tune or two : but , as well as , surpass I much . we all sung too in turn , and . take the violin , in which he excel . oblige we on the violincello : play on the german flute , and sung we a fop 's song , and perform it in character ; so that we have a exceeding gay evening , and part with great satisfaction on all side , particularly on the young lady ; for this put they all in good humour , and good spirit , enliven the former scene , which otherwise might have closed , perhaps more gravely than efficaciously . the distance of time since this conversation pass , enable I to add what I could not do , when I write the account of it , which you have mislaid : and which take briefly , as follow : be as good as she word , and write down all she could recollect of the conversation : and I have already send she the letter she desire , contain my observation upon the flighty style she so much admired , it have such a effect upon she , as to turn the course of she reading and study to weightier and more solid subject ; and avoid the gentleman she have begin to favour , give way to she parent 's recommendation , and be happily marry to . come to I a week after , with the leave of both she parent , and tarry with I three day ; in which time she open all she heart to I , and return in such a disposition , and with such resolutions , that she never would see she peer again ; nor receive letter from he , which she own to I she have do clandestinely before ; and she be now the happy lady of , who make she the best of husband , and permit she to follow she charitable inclination accord to a scheme which she consult I upon . , by the dean 's indulgent prudence and discretion , have escape she rake ; and upon the discovery of a intrigue he be carry on with another , conceive a just abhorrence of he ; and be since marry to , as you know , with whom she live very happily . be not quite so well off as the three former ; though not altogether so unhappy neither , in she way . she could not indeed conquer she love of dress and tinsel , and so become the lady of . : and they be thus far easy in the marriage state , that , be seldom together , they have probably a multitude of misunderstanding ; for the colonel love game , in which he be generally a winner ; and so pass he time mostly in town . he lady have she pleasur , neither laudable nor criminal one , which she pursue in the country . and now and then a letter pass on both side , by . the inscription and subscription of which they remind one another that they have be once in they life at one church together , and what now , my dear , have I to add to this tedious account ( for letter I can hardly call it ) but that I be , with great affection , _you true friend and servant , my , you desire to have a little specimen of my _nursery tale and _story , with which , as tell you , on she return to , I entertain my and my little boy . but you make I too high a compliment , when you tell I , it be for you _own_ instruction and example . yet you know , my dear , be you motives what they will , I must obey you , although , be other to see it , I might expose myself to the smile and contempt of judge less prejudiced in my favour . so I will begin without any further apology ; and , as near as I can , give you those very story with which be so pleased , and of which she have make so favourable a report . let I acquaint you , then , that my method be to give character of person I have know in one part or other of my life , in feigned name , whose conduct may serve for imitation or warning to my dear attentive miss ; and sometimes I give instance of good boy and naughty boy , for the sake of my and my Daver ; and they be continually come about I
I , " dear madam , a pretty story , " now cry : " and dear mamma , tell I of good boy , and of naughty boy , " cry . be a surprising child of she age , and be very familiar with many of the best characters in the Spectator ; and have a smattering of , and more than a smattering of Italian , and be a perfect mistress of , be seldom at a loss for a derivation of such word as be not of English original . and so I shall give you a story in feigned name , with which she be so delighted , that she have write it down . but I will first trespass on you patience with one of my childish tale . every day , once or twice , I cause , who play and sing very prettily , to give a tune or two to I , my and my Daver , who , as well as my , love and learn to touch the key , young as the latter be ; and she will have a sweet finger ; I can observe that ; and a charme ear ; and she voice be music itself !-" of the fond , fond mother ! " I know you will say , on read this . then , , we all proceed , hand - in - hand , together to the nursery , to my and : and in this happy retirement , so much my delight in the absence of my best belove , imagine you see I seat , surround with the joy and the hope of my future prospect , as well as my present comforts . , imagine you see , on my right hand , sit on a velvet stool , because she be eldest , and a miss ; Billy on my left , in a little cane elbow - chair , because he be eldest , and a good boy ; my Davers , and my sparkling - ey would , with my between they , on little silken cushion , at my foot , hand - in - hand , they pleased eye look up to my more delighted one ; and my sweet - nature promise , in my lap ; the nurse and the cradle just behind we , and the nursery maid delightedly pursue some useful needle - work for the dear charmer of my heart - all as hush and as still as silence itself , as the pretty creature generally be , when they little , watchful eye see my lip begin to open : for they take neat notice already of my rule of two ear to one tongue , insomuch that if or Davers be either of they for break the mum , as they call it , they be immediately hush , at any time , if I put my finger to my lip , or if miss point hers to she ear , even to the breaking of a word in two , as it be : and yet all my boy be as lively as so many bird : while my be cheerful , easy , soft , gentle , always smile , but modest and harmless as a dove . I begin with a story of two little boy , and two little girl , the child of a fine gentleman , and a fine lady , who love they dearly ; that they be all so good , and love one another so well , that every body who see they , admire they , and talk of they far and near ; that they would part with any thing to the another ; love the poor ; speak kindly to the servants ; do every thing they be bid to do ; be not proud ; kknow no strife , but who should learn they book best , and be the prettiest scholar ; that the servants love they , and would do any thing they desire ; that they be not proud of fine clothes ; let not they head run upon they plaything when they should mind they book ; say grace before they eat , they prayer before they go to bed , and as soon as they rise ; be always clean and neat ; would not tell a fib for the world , and be above do any thing that require one ; that bless they more and more , and bless they papa and mamma , and they uncle and aunt , and cousin , for they sake . " and there be a happy family , my dear love ! - no one idle ; all prettily employ ; the at they book ; the at they book too , or at they needle ; except at they play - hour , when they be never rude , nor noisy , nor mischievous , nor quarrelsome : and no such word be ever hear from they mouth , as , ' why may not I have this or that , as well as or ? ' or , ' why should Sally have this or that , any more than I ? ' but it be , 's as my mamma please ; my mamma know best ;' and a bow and a smile , and no surliness , or scowling brow to be see , if they be deny any thing ; for well do they know that they papa and mamma love they so dearly , that they would refuse they nothing that be for they good ; and they be sure when they be refuse , they ask for something that would have do they hurt , have it be grant . never be such good boy and girl as these I and they grow
grow up ; and the become fine scholar , and fine gentleman , and every body honoure they : and the become fine lady , and fine housewive ; and this gentleman , when they grow to be woman , seek to marry one of the , and that gentleman the other ; and happy be he that could be admit into they company I so that they have nothing to do but to pick and choose out of the best gentleman in the country : while the greatest lady for birth and the most remarkable for virtue ( which , my dear , be better than either birth or fortune ) , think themselves honoure by the address of the two brother . and they marry , and make good papa and mamma , and be so many blessing to the age in which they liv . there , my dear love , be happy son and daughter ; for good seldom fail to make good gentleman ; and good Misse , good lady ; and bless they with as good child as they be to they parent ; and so the blessing go round !- who would not but be good ? " " well , but , mamma , we will all be good :- will not we , master Davers ? " cry my . " yes , brother . but what will become of the naughty boy ? tell we , mamma , about the naughty boy ! " " why , there be a poor , poor widow woman , who have three naughty son , and one naughty daughter ; and they would do nothing that they mamma bid they do ; be always quarrelling , scratching , and fight ; would not say they prayer ; would not learn they book ; so that the little boy use to laugh at they , and point at they , as they go along , for blockhead ; and nobody love they , or take notice of they , except to beat and thump they about , for they naughty way , and they undutifulness to they poor mother , who work hard to maintain they . as they grow up , they grow worse and worse , and more and more stupid and ignorant ; so that they impoverish they poor mother , and at last broke she heart , poor poor widow woman !-- and she neighbour join together to bury the poor widow woman : for these sad ungracious child make away with what little she have leave , while she be ill , before she heart be quite break ; and this help to break it the sooner : for have she liv , she see she must have want bread , and have no comfort with such wicked child . " " poor poor widow woman ! " say my , with tear ; and my little dove she tear too , and be move , and wip she fine eye . " but what become of the naughty boy , and the naughty girl , mamma ? " " became of they ! why one son be force to go to sea , and there he be drown : another turn thief ( for he would not work ) , and he come to a untimely end : the third be idle and ignorant , and nobody , who know how he use he poor mother , would employ he ; and so he be force to go into a far country , and beg he bread . and the naughty girl , have never love work , pin away in sloth and filthiness , and at last broke she arm , and die of a fever , lament , too late , that she have be so wick a daughter to so good a mother !-- and so there be a sad end to all the four ungracious child , who never would mind what they poor mother say to they ; and punish they naughtiness as you see !-- While the good child I mention before , be the glory of they family , and the delight of every body that know they . " " who would not be good ? " be the inference : and the repetition from , with he hand clapt together , " Poor widow woman ! " give I much pleasure . so my childish story end , with a kiss of each pretty dear , and they thanks for my story : and then come on 's request for a woman 's story , as she call it . I dismiss my baby to they play ; and take 's hand , she stand before I , all attention , begin in a more womanly strain to _her ; for she be very fond of be think a woman ; and indeed be a prudent sensible dear , comprehend any thing instantly , and make very pretty reflection upon what she hear or read as you will observe in what follow : " there be nothing , my dear , that young lady should be so watchful over , as they reputation : ' ttis a tender flower that the least frost will nip , the least cold wind will blast ; and when once blast , it will never flourish again , but wither to the very root . but this I have tell you so often , I need not repeat what I have say . so to my story . " there be four pretty lady live in one genteel neighbourhood , daughter of four several family ; but all companion and visitor ; and yet all of very different inclination . we will call one , another , the third , and Prudentia the fourth ; they several name denote they respective quality . "
" Coquetilla be the only daughter of a worthy baronet , by a lady very gay , but rather indiscreet than unvirtuous , who take not the requisite care of she daughter 's education , but let she be over-run with the love of fashion , dress , and equipage ; and when in , ball , operas , play , the , the , the withdrawing - room , take up she whole attention . she admire nobody but herself , flutter about , laugh at , and despise a crowd of men-follower , whom she attract by gay , thoughtless freedom of behaviour , too nearly tread on the skirt of immodesty : yet make she not one worthy conquest , excit , on the contrary , in all sober mind , that contempt of herself , which she so profusely would be think to pour down upon the rest of the world . after she have several year flutter about the dangerous light , like some silly fly , she at last singe the wing of she reputation ; for , be despise by every worthy heart , she become too easy and cheap a prey to a man the most unworthy of all she follower , who have resolution and confidence enough to break through those few cobweb reserve , in which she have encircle she precarious virtue ; and which be no longer of force to preserve she honour , when she meet with a man more bold and more enterprising than herself , and who be as design as she be thoughtless . and what then become of ?- why , she be force to pass over sea to , where nobody know she , and to bury herself in a dull obscurity ; to go by another name , and at last , unable to support a life so unsuitable to the natural gaiety of she temper , she pine herself into a consumption , and die , unpitied and unlamented , among stranger , have not one friend but whom she buy with she money . " " poor ! " say ; " what a sad thing it be to have a wrong education ; and how happy am I , who have so good a lady to supply the place of a dear distant mamma ! - but be pleased , Madam , to proceed to the next . " " , my dear , be the daughter of a gentleman who be a widower , and have , while the young lady be a infant , bury she mamma . he be a good sort of man ; but have but one lesson to teach to , and that be to avoid all sort of conversation with the man ; but never give she the right turn of mind , nor instil into it that sense of she religious duty , which would have be she best guard in all temptation . for , provide she keep out of the sight and conversation of the gentleman , and avoid the company of those ladie who more freely converse with the other sex , it be all she papa desire of she . this give she a haughty , sullen , and reserve turn ; make she stiff , formal , and affect . she have sense enough to discover early the fault of , and , in dislike to they , fall the more easily into that contrary extreme , which a recluse education , and she papa 's caution , naturally lead she . so that pride , reserve , affectation , and censoriousness , make up the essential of she character , and she become more unamiable even than ; and as the other be too accessible , be quite unapproachable by gentleman , and unfit for any conversation , but that of she servants , be also desert by those of she own sex , by whom she might have improve , on account of she censorious disposition . and what be the consequence ? why this : every worthy person of both sex despise she , and she be use to see nobody but servants , at last throw herself upon one of that class : in a evil hour , she find something that be take to she low taste in the person of she papa 's valet , a wretch so infinitely beneath she ( but a gay coxcomb of a servant ) , that every body attribute to she the scandal of make the first advance ; for , otherwise , it be presume , he durst not have look up to he master 's daughter . so here end all she pride . all she reserf come to this ! she censoriousness of other redouble people 's contempt upon herself , and make nobody pity she . she be finally turn out of door , without a penny of fortune : the fellow be force to set up a barber 's shop in a country town ; for all he knew be to shave and dress a peruke : and she papa would never look upon she more : so that become the outcast of she family , and the scorn of all that know she ; and be force to mingle in conversation and company with the wretch of she husband 's degree ! " " poor , miserable ! " say -- " what a sad , sad fall be hers . and all owe to the want of a proper education too ! -- and to the loss of such a mamma , as I have a aunt ; and so wise a papa as I have a uncle !-- how could she papa , I wonder , restrain she person as he do , like a poor nun , and make she unacquainted with the generous restraint of
of the mind ? " I be sure , my dear good aunt , it will be owe to you , that I shall never be a , nor a Prudiana neither . you table be always surround with the best of company , with worthy gentleman as well as lady : and you instruct I to judge of both , and of every new guest , in such a manner , as make I esteem they all , and censure nobody ; but yet to see fault in some to avoid , and graces in other to imitate ; but in nobody but yourself and my uncle , any thing so like perfection , as shall attract one 's admiration to one 's own ruin . " " you be young , yet , my love , and must always doubt you own strength ; and pray to , more and more , as you year advance , to give you more and more prudence , and watchfulness over you conduct . " but yet , my dear , you must think justly of yourself too ; for let the young gentleman be ever so learn and discreet , you education entitle you to think as well of yourself as of they : for , do not you see , the lady who be so kind as to visit we , that have not be abroad , as you have be , when they be young , yet make as good figure in conversation , say as good thing as any of the gentleman ? for , my dear , all that the gentleman know more than the ladie , except here and there such a one as you dear uncle , with all they learn education , be only , that they have be _disciplin , perhaps , into a observation of a few accuracy in speech , which , if they know no more , rather distinguish the _pedant_ than the _gentleman : such as the avoiding of a false concord , as they call it , and which you know how to do , as well as the best ; not to put a _wa for a _where , a _are for a _is , and to be able to speak in mood and tense , and such like valuable part of education : so that , my dear , you can have no reason to look upon that sex in so high a light , as to depreciate you own : and yet you must not be proud nor conceit neither ; but make this one rule you guide : " in you _maiden state , think yourself _above_ the gentleman , and they will think you so too , and address you with reverence and respect , if they see there be neither pride nor arrogance in you behaviour , but a consciousness of merit , a true dignity , such as become virgin modesty , and untainted purity of mind and manners , like that of a angel among man ; for so young lady should look upon themselves to be , and will then be treat as such by the other sex . " in you _married state , which be a kind of state of humiliation for a lady , you must think yourself subordinate to you husband ; for so it have pleas to make the wife . you must have no will of you own , in _petty thing ; and if you marry a gentleman of sense and honour , such a one as you uncle , he will look upon you as he equal ; and will exal you the more for you abase yourself . in short , my dear , he will act by you , just as you dear uncle do by I : and then , what a happy creature will you be ! " " so I shall , ! to be sure I shall ! -- but I know I shall be happy whenever I marry , because I have such wise directors , and such a example , before I : and , if it please , I will never think of any man ( in pursuance of you constant advice to young lady at the tea - table ) , who be not a man of sense , and a virtuous gentleman . but now , dear madam , for you next character . there be two more yet to come , that be my pleasure ! I wish there be ten ! " " why the next be , you may remember , my love . take another course to _her_ ruin . she fall into some of 's foible , but pursue they for another end , and in another manner . strike with the grandeur and magnificence of what weak people call the _upper life , she give herself up to the circus , to ball , to operas , to masquerade , and assemblie ; affect to shine at the head of all company , at , at , and every place of public resort ; plays high , be always receive and pay visit , give ball , and make treat and entertainment ; and be so much _above_ the conduct which mostly recommend a young lady to the esteem of the deserving of the other sex , that no gentleman , who prefer solid happiness , can think of address she , though she be a fine person , and have many outward graces of behaviour . she become the favourite toast of the place she frequent , be proud of that distinction ; give the fashion , and delights in the pride , that she can make ap in imitation , whenever she please . but yet endeavour to avoid be think proud , make herself cheap , and be the subject of
of the attempt of every coxcomb of eminence ; and with much ado , preserve she virtue , though not she character . " what , all this while , be poor do ? she would be glad , perhaps , of a suitable proposal , and would , it may be , give up some of she gaiety and extravagance : for have wit , and be not totally destitute of reason , when she suffer herself to think . but she conduct procure she not one solid friendship , and she have not in a twelvemonth , among a thousand profession of service , one devoir that she can attend to , or a friend that she can depend upon . all the woman she see , if she excel they , hate she : the gay part of the man , with whom she accompany most , be all in a plot against she honour . even the gentleman , whose conduct in the general be govern by principle of virtue , come down to these public place to partake of the innocent freedom allow there , and oftentimes give themselves air of gallantry , and never have it in they thought to commence a treaty of marriage with a acquaintance begin upon that gay spot . what solid friendship and satisfactions then be exclude from ! " she name indeed be write in every public window , and prostitute , as I may call it , at the pleasure of every profligate or sot , who wear a diamond to engrave it : and that it may be , with most vile and barbarous imputation and freedom of word , add by rake , who very probably never exchange a syllable with she . the wounded tree be perhaps also teach to wear the initial of she name , link , not unlikely , and wide as they grow , with those of a scoundrel . but all this while she make not the least impression upon one noble heart : and at last , perhaps , have run on to the end of a uninterrupted race of folly , she be cheat into the arm of some vile fortune - hunter ; who quickly lavish away the remains of that fortune which she extravagance have leave ; and then , after the worst usage , abandon she with contempt , she sink into a obscurity that cut short the thread of she life , and leave no remembrance , but on the britle glass , and still more faithless bark , that ever she have a being . " " Alas , alas ! what a butterfly of a day , " say ( a expression she remember of Lady Towers ) , " be poor ! -- what a sad thing to be so dazzl by worldly grandeur , and to have so many admirer , and not one real friend ! " " very true , my dear ; and how carefully ought a person of a gay and lively temper to watch over it I and what a rock may public place be to a lady 's reputation , if she be not doubly vigilant in she conduct , when she be expose to the censure and observation of malignant crowd of people ; many of the worst of whom spare the least those who be most unlike themselves . " " but then , , " say , " would venture to play at public place ? will lady game , ? I have hear you say , that lord , and sharper but just out of livery , in gaming , be upon a foot in every thing , save that one have nothing to lose , and the other much , besides he reputation ! and will lady so disgrase they character , and they sex , as to pursue this pernicious diversion in public ? " " yes , my dear , they will too often , the more be the pity ! and do not you remember , when we be at , in what a hurry I once pass by some knot of genteel people , and you ask what those be do ? I tell you , whisperingly , they be game ; and loath I be , that my should stop to see some sight , to which , till she arrive at the year of discretion , it be not proper to familiarize she eye ; in some sort act like the ancient , who would not assign punishment to certain atrocious crime , because they have such a high idea of human nature , as to suppose it incapable of commit they ; so I be not for have you , while a little girl , see those thing , which I know would give no credit to we sex , and which I think , when you grow older , should be new and shock to you : but now you be so much a woman in discretion , I may tell you any thing . " she kiss my hand , and make I a fine curtsey - and tell I , that now she longe to hear of 's conduct . " _her_ name , madam , " say she , " promise better thing than those of she three companion ; and so it have need : for how sad be it to think , that out of four lady of distinction , three of they should be naughty , and , _or course , unhappy . " -" these two word , _or course , my dear , " say I , " be very prettily put in : let I kiss you for it : since every one that be naughty , first or last , must be _certainly unhappy . " far otherwise than what I
I have relate , be it with the amiable Prudentia . like the industrious bee , she make up she honey - hoard from every flower , bitter as well as sweet ; for every character be of use to she , by which she can improve she own . she have the happiness of a aunt , who love she , as I do you ; and of a uncle who doate on she , as yours do : for , alas ! poor lose she papa and mamma almost in she infancy , in one week : but be so happy in she uncle and aunt 's care , as not to miss they in she education , and but just to remember they person . by read , by observation , and by attention , she dailly add new advantage to those which she education give she . she see , and pitie , the fluttering freedom and dangerous night of . the sullen pride , the affectation , and stiff reserve , which assume , she penetrat , and make it she study to avoid . and the gay , hazardous conduct , extravagant temper , and love of tinselled grandeur , which be the blemish of 's character , she dread and shunn . she fortify herself with the excellent example of the past and present age , and know how to avoid the fault of the faulty , and to imitate the graces of the most perfect . she take into she scheme of that future happiness , which she hope to make she own , what be the true excellency of she sex , and endeavour to appropriate to herself the domestic virtue , which shall one day make she the crown of some worthy gentleman 's earthly happiness : and which , _or course , as you prettily say , my dear , will secure and heighten she own . " that noble frankness of disposition , that sweet and unaffected openness and simplicity , which shines in all her action and behaviour , commend she to the esteem and reverence of all mankind ; as she humility and affability , and a temper uncensorious , and ever make the best of what she say of the absent person , of either sex , do to the love of every lady . she name , indeed , be not prostitute on window , nor carve on the bark of tree in public place : but it smell sweet to every nostril , dwell on every tongue , and be engraven on every heart . she meet with no address but from man of honour and probity : the flutter coxcomb , the inveigling parasite , the insidious deceiver , the mercenary fortune - hunter , spread no snare for a heart guard by discretion and prudence , as hers be . they see , that all she amiable virtue be the happy result of a uniform judgment , and the effect of she own wisdom , found in a education to which she do the highest credit . and at last , after several worthy offer , enough to perplex a lady 's choice , she bless some one happy gentleman , more distinguished than the rest , for learn , good sense , and _true politeness , which be but another word for _virtue_ and _honour ; and shine , to she last hour , in all the duty of domestic life , as a excellent wife , mother , mistress , friend , and ; and so confirm all the expectation of which she maiden life have give such strong and such edifying presage . " then fold my dear miss in my arm , and kiss she , tear of pleasure stand in she pretty eye , " who would not , " say I , " shin the example of the 's , the 's , and the 's of this world , and choose to ' imitate the character of ! - the happy , and the happy - make . " " of ! madam ! " say the dear creature , smother I with she rapturous kiss , " be you !--Is you indeed !-- it _can be nobody else !-- o teach I , good ! to follow _your_ example , and I shall be a Second Prudentia -- indeed I shall ! " " send you may , my beloved miss ! and may he bless you more , if possible , than be bless ! " and so , my dear , you have some of my nursery tale ; with which , rely on you kind allowances and friendship , I conclude myself _your affectionate and faithful_ P.B. conclusion the editor think proper to conclude in this place , that he may not be think to deserve a suspicion , that the extent of the work be to be measure by the patience of its reader . but he think it necessary , in order to elucidate the whole , to subjoin a note of the follow fact . . ( after the affair which take date at the masquerade , and conclude so happily ) continue to be one of the best and most exemplary of man , a honour to he country , both in he public and private capacity ; have , at the instance of some of he friend in very elevated stations , accept of a honourable employment abroad in the service of the state ; which he dischar in such a manner , as might be expect from he qualifications and knowledge of the world : and on he return , after a absence of three year , resist all the temptation of ambition , devote himself to private duty , and join with he excellent lady in every pious wish of she heart ; adorn
